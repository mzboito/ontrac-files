-d5dN54tH2E_0 we're going to work on an arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you 
-d5dN54tH2E_1 i can't painting the walls 
-d5dN54tH2E_10 go up and down let's switch hands and 
-d5dN54tH2E_11 settlers fingers relax 
-d5dN54tH2E_12 together we are going to go opposite 
-d5dN54tH2E_13 but very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable 
-d5dN54tH2E_14 it 's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead so try not to let them do that 
-d5dN54tH2E_15 the risks to all the leading 
-d5dN54tH2E_2 so this one what you're going to start with let's take one hand first it's going to the rest is going to come down and the rest is going to come up 
-d5dN54tH2E_3 so basically arrest is going to be leading the movement and let the fingers follow nice and relax where the rest is going 
-d5dN54tH2E_4 don't let the fingers take over but the risk to all the guiding 
-d5dN54tH2E_5 let's make sure that our feet are parallel and our knees are soft 
-d5dN54tH2E_6 belly buttons pull them pressing it toward our spine and our chests has lifted in her arms so relaxed or shoulders are nice and relaxed 
-d5dN54tH2E_7 so serves the one hand going up and down 
-d5dN54tH2E_8 we keep this right in front of us you don't want to have in front of your face of the block yourself 
-d5dN54tH2E_9 want right in front of your solar plexus 
-f1_kdl050s_0 this clip we're going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise 
-f1_kdl050s_1 a number one last for these birds his flight 
-f1_kdl050s_10 can be very very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flight 
-f1_kdl050s_11 it seems to be the number one way to lose 
-f1_kdl050s_12 once they get loose outside predators get to them very quickly 
-f1_kdl050s_13 these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they don't survive 
-f1_kdl050s_14 the other dingy that worry about is teflon pan 
-f1_kdl050s_15 if their heat into a high temperature and give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them to basically fell off their perch dead 
-f1_kdl050s_16 there 's nothing you can do about it and it's very quickly 
-f1_kdl050s_17 kind of a silent killer 
-f1_kdl050s_18 so if you have them in the kitchen if you're going to cook with teflon with them to another room in the house so that you can protect them 
-f1_kdl050s_19 parcels spraying for bugs spraying perfumes around the house on all those sorts of things these brits have very very sensitive upper respiratory tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol can irritate on their lungs 
-f1_kdl050s_2 these guys are you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household 
-f1_kdl050s_20 these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die 
-f1_kdl050s_21 so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house 
-f1_kdl050s_22 and lastly there so so tiny so basically anything your house a dog a cat anything they can get pushed into door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or your cat where your kid they'll just squish 
-f1_kdl050s_23 so there's not a whole lot to them they're not that robust they're mostly feathers 
-f1_kdl050s_24 so have to be fairly careful with these birds 
-f1_kdl050s_25 at least in a in a physical way 
-f1_kdl050s_26 those are most of your household dangers 
-f1_kdl050s_27 again if you're cooking in the birds loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan 
-f1_kdl050s_28 we don't want toilet seats open if they're flying around your house because they could fly in and drowned 
-f1_kdl050s_29 be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house 
-f1_kdl050s_3 a lot of these birds aren't team 
-f1_kdl050s_30 and make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked out for 
-f1_kdl050s_31 and if they're alone in their cages just make sure that your other pets if it's a smaller cage cannot their cage over and either let the birds fly out or they can't reach through the viruses 
-f1_kdl050s_32 like a cat might dig through the bars that small enough and be able to grab ahold of the bird 
-f1_kdl050s_33 and if the birds outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine reckons have been known to break into their cages tear through the bars and rip into these guys 
-f1_kdl050s_34 so you've got to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time 
-f1_kdl050s_35 more or less covers just be careful remember your birds very small and sensitive much more sensitive to chemicals than many other pets are 
-f1_kdl050s_4 people get them and they just have two or three of them 
-f1_kdl050s_5 as your opening up the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away 
-f1_kdl050s_6 when they panic they fly and they don't come back 
-f1_kdl050s_7 flat your windows 
-f1_kdl050s_8 still fly out your front door 
-f1_kdl050s_9 it will be think that everything sealed and vertical clean the papers in your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that verges flies right out 
00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1 the hottest become very popular here of late is the circle hooks circle hook had been use japanese fishermen longliners for years and years but in recent years if develop lighter smaller ensure type hooks which are very well suited particularly the folks at or into the hook and release type fishing 
00dWJ4YRRSI_2 facebook basically is designed to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth 
00dWJ4YRRSI_3 this type of work when you get a bite you can't jerk derived set to hook 
00dWJ4YRRSI_4 we basically just real down and get the line tight and official take off and when he does usually turns comes right in the corner of his mouth and srx really like a kind of like a bottle opener 
00dWJ4YRRSI_5 watch once you get it in there it is very difficult to remove this hook so you catch a lot of fish when you hook up the fish you rarely ever lose and because of that particular mechanism 
00dWJ4YRRSI_6 the nice thing about the circle hook is good hook a lot of fish 
00dWJ4YRRSI_7 damaged a lot of fish 
00dWJ4YRRSI_8 simply getting up to the bone 
00dWJ4YRRSI_9 if you want to relay seem you can relay seamer cut the hook out and it's a pretty it's a pretty friendly hook for fishing 
0oGfy530AuI_0 thrusters 
0oGfy530AuI_1 right now we're going into a more complicated exercise 
0oGfy530AuI_10 once you don't sit back 
0oGfy530AuI_11 and as he drives up again driving on his heels drive and his hips forward is the work from his hips that will burn for the arms up 
0oGfy530AuI_12 
0oGfy530AuI_13 then there was a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbells right above his shoulders 
0oGfy530AuI_14 and not out to decide not back but right above 
0oGfy530AuI_15 scared 
0oGfy530AuI_16 good work jones 
0oGfy530AuI_17 again work in from the heals up work with your breath fuel that your job and your hips forward and up each time good work 
0oGfy530AuI_18 ten of those and their own sega three to five minute break and then come back to it 
0oGfy530AuI_19 again i want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing thruster that is working from the ground up and it's one smooth movement 
0oGfy530AuI_2 integrating more of the body 
0oGfy530AuI_20 it 's not segment 
0oGfy530AuI_21 it 's not the squat and his shoulder press 
0oGfy530AuI_22 one smooth movement 
0oGfy530AuI_23 strike 
0oGfy530AuI_3 and ruined developed more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion 
0oGfy530AuI_4 applause 
0oGfy530AuI_5 so jones and you want to go ahead and show thruster risk 
0oGfy530AuI_6 he 's on take a couple of dumbbells bring them up to his shoulders 
0oGfy530AuI_7 were basically he's going to sit back into a squat 
0oGfy530AuI_8 and we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press but it's not that simple 
0oGfy530AuI_9 not segmented like that 
0pKzG0RRUz4_0 another technique is you can break the hair on first and then start rationing because some people have really short hair and wouldn't create the look with adding the hearing 
0pKzG0RRUz4_1 so no matter what the length of your hair long as is long enough to addo at the here on we can start vibrating at on then re rap and you can make these as thick as you light whatever size like whatever color you like 
0pKzG0RRUz4_2 the lack extensions because it's not damaging to year here at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair he just wrap on a different color 
0pKzG0RRUz4_3 but really like that 
0pKzG0RRUz4_4 you can get instant length which i love 
0pKzG0RRUz4_5 you have a skinny and we have a lot of fatter ones 
0pKzG0RRUz4_6 we can make them even fatter 
0pKzG0RRUz4_7 whatever length we can just keep adding here forever and ever and it will just go on and on 
0pKzG0RRUz4_8 we can make them as long as we want 
0zvsqf23tmw_1 in this segment i'm going to just start painting in the background color 
0zvsqf23tmw_10 faster on the edge to edge painted in the skyline 
0zvsqf23tmw_11 to kill her new trailer 
0zvsqf23tmw_12 and to find the edges and then just dry brush it to fill it in a little bit 
0zvsqf23tmw_13 too much pain on the wall and 
0zvsqf23tmw_14 we really don't need to use a lot of pain 
0zvsqf23tmw_15 we need a lot of pain on your brush 
0zvsqf23tmw_16 and just take it easy and then use more pain issue start filling your details 
0zvsqf23tmw_17 it was just a tiny bit and this 
0zvsqf23tmw_18 entire marilyn can kind of fade into the wall 
0zvsqf23tmw_19 be a wall to wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go 
0zvsqf23tmw_2 when you do a children's wall mural you probably most likely want to start with like your sky first 
0zvsqf23tmw_3 into your background before you get all your objects in those are should always be last 
0zvsqf23tmw_4 what i got here is and got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint in them in a flat paint so 
0zvsqf23tmw_5 chip brush and i'm just going to kind of dry brush it a little bit under the wall and 
0zvsqf23tmw_6 do way solid onto the wall and just 
0zvsqf23tmw_7 start tapping it on and get in the wall color on there 
0zvsqf23tmw_8 we need to mix it down a little bit than i can always use a little bit a medium or little bit of water to dilute it 
0zvsqf23tmw_9 keep a painter earn 
1-xK5UtDSmE_0 will look at it from from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business the ceo and in my profession i work for a company that provides wellness programs 
1-xK5UtDSmE_1 we've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful producing results 
1-xK5UtDSmE_10 another one would be eating a proper diet 
1-xK5UtDSmE_11 when we got to that i said you know and it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the the bad foods 
1-xK5UtDSmE_12 and i said well you know like ice cream ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time it's got so much sugar and it is really going to have an effect on the present so will we can't go there that's my favorite food 
1-xK5UtDSmE_13 so then i said well maybe sodas who would be something that you would start with 
1-xK5UtDSmE_14 he said oil and vice president said we can't go there because he's addicted to soda 
1-xK5UtDSmE_15 so the net net is after our presentation i called back and i wasn't getting any called 
1-xK5UtDSmE_16 we want to wellness program but we really don't want to lead 
1-xK5UtDSmE_17 but when you think about that is is that going to get the job done for 
1-xK5UtDSmE_18 so i speak to you mr ceo mr corporate owner mr corporate president that are trying to to produce something positive in your company you need to pay attention to your own health 
1-xK5UtDSmE_19 think about it if you have a heart attack if you're hit with cancer what is going to duty organization 
1-xK5UtDSmE_2 and so the real key to it is you mr ceo you mr owner of the business and why would that be 
1-xK5UtDSmE_3 well if you're not healthy can you have a healthy organization 
1-xK5UtDSmE_4 if you're not setting the example if you're not being the leader than who's going to lead 
1-xK5UtDSmE_5 i've spoken with several different companies can remember one particular a bank president and his senior vice president we sat down together we started to talk about this subject of because he wanted a wellness program and that's why i was there 
1-xK5UtDSmE_6 and so we started talking about it and i said to him well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really healthy group of employees 
1-xK5UtDSmE_7 and i said well one of them would be exercise 
1-xK5UtDSmE_8 we 're going to have to have some way of getting your employees involved with regular exercise 
1-xK5UtDSmE_9 another one is drinking water and we're going to get into these more detail 
11JT4jRNI-o_0 let 's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that 
11JT4jRNI-o_1 again so many variations 
11JT4jRNI-o_10 key on this one and something to keep in mind on this position is this 
11JT4jRNI-o_11 if you're to being is really tight you might not be able to get up and less your legs are close together 
11JT4jRNI-o_12 squat position close together doesn't work very well 
11JT4jRNI-o_13 so the key on something like this is that you're too been what you've purchased or what you have has enough flexibility that when you stand on it you can really stand wide 
11JT4jRNI-o_14 but it's definitely a great exercise and i highly recommend it 
11JT4jRNI-o_2 want to show you something simple and basic 
11JT4jRNI-o_3 my theory about shoulder width apart pretty much have to do a decent squat 
11JT4jRNI-o_4 i'm going to take my tubing up and i'm going to open up my palm so they're facing forward 
11JT4jRNI-o_5 what am i doing with this 
11JT4jRNI-o_6 as i go down and up in a squat position i have to resist the tubing right 
11JT4jRNI-o_7 trying to keep me from coming out 
11JT4jRNI-o_8 as i stretch the to be straight up and down it makes the squat harder 
11JT4jRNI-o_9 once again you don't want to have been forward too much on this 
1G8LIWgKLME_0 began your data now art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as the daughter 
1G8LIWgKLME_1 stylists comes with different sized round it ends on it anywhere ranging from very small two very large 
1G8LIWgKLME_2 but there's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do 
1G8LIWgKLME_3 for a very small intricate design like an eye you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have whereas if you're wanting to do something large such as a sudden you're going to want to use the largest in the you have 
1G8LIWgKLME_4 also sizes if you want it to do things like buttons or two small designed like that 
1G8LIWgKLME_5 for your polish color you're going to want to use a polished that is either complimentary or contrasting 
1G8LIWgKLME_6 i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen 
1QmgK8f5JnY_0 paloma names rebecca her license massage therapist in wilmington north carolina and i'm here to give my review and massage parlors 
1QmgK8f5JnY_1 first of all massage parlor is a very david term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to steer away from that and work hard to get the respect that that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves 
1QmgK8f5JnY_2 so having said that when you're looking for a place to get a massage you can call it a massage therapy center or a wellness center something of that nature and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check in the background of the location and also of the therapists practicing their 
1QmgK8f5JnY_3 we always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapists 
1QmgK8f5JnY_4 and you can check with local local networks newspapers other massage therapists in the area for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on research priorities 
1V-aOg8wCT4_10 well let's not forget your charity or event website 
1V-aOg8wCT4_11 is a great place to promote your sponsors as well 
1V-aOg8wCT4_12 we can do this through the honors links to their website or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor 
1V-aOg8wCT4_13 finally i hopefully going to handle lots and lots of fliers 
1V-aOg8wCT4_14 in a flier is a great way to promote the sponsor 
1V-aOg8wCT4_15 again depending on the level they might just get their website lifted 
1V-aOg8wCT4_16 the larch sponsor they could have the logo or a full ad 
1V-aOg8wCT4_17 for more colorful and wright flyer the federal 
1V-aOg8wCT4_18 remember sponsors are looking for potential customers promotion and publicity 
1V-aOg8wCT4_19 also remember happy spots are sure to come back year after year after year 
1V-aOg8wCT4_2 how can i create great sponsorships my golf tournament you cry 
1V-aOg8wCT4_3 when the words because that's exactly what the segments about 
1V-aOg8wCT4_4 take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors 
1V-aOg8wCT4_5 begin with you can utilize your very own golf program that uses the product 
1V-aOg8wCT4_6 depending on the size of the sponsorship you can offer order page half page or full page ads 
1V-aOg8wCT4_7 fatal sponsors might get advertisement on the front or the back cover of the actual programs 
1V-aOg8wCT4_8 another great burke offer a vendor table at the event 
1V-aOg8wCT4_9 companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event 
1aJwX9nRlmk_0 and next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the attention or your headache is happening 
1aJwX9nRlmk_1 my hair back so that you can see this little bit easier 
1aJwX9nRlmk_10 we are here the shoulders aren't creeping up their stone 
1aJwX9nRlmk_11 melting down on either side of the spine 
1aJwX9nRlmk_12 inhale think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades and exhale secrets 
1aJwX9nRlmk_13 with three part breath into the belly into the rib cage and then into the heart 
1aJwX9nRlmk_14 in hell you're gonna let the left here come over towards love shoulder notice again 
1aJwX9nRlmk_15 the right shoulder isn't going to pop up in the left shoulder they're going to come up to support the area and just keep 
1aJwX9nRlmk_16 gently falling down so in here 
1aJwX9nRlmk_17 gear up and you're going to breathe here now slowly 
1aJwX9nRlmk_18 began to connect these movements acts hailing as you drop then change who were in the chest and inhaling as the air roads or towards the shoulder blade and do this as long as you're comfortable odds 
1aJwX9nRlmk_19 at least twenty or applications 
1aJwX9nRlmk_2 well that's going to happen as you're going to be seeded in your easy seated posts again with their citizens on the floor or on a block 
1aJwX9nRlmk_20 keep it going for a minute that scrape stick with the breathless 
1aJwX9nRlmk_21 breastfeeding is for every movement and don't ever let yourself gives the breath away 
1aJwX9nRlmk_3 we 're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches so that you're sitting tall but you're not going to be propped this way 
1aJwX9nRlmk_4 if you're sitting this way than just relax your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine but the crowd of your head is still reaching 
1aJwX9nRlmk_5 inhale and then as you exhale just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder 
1aJwX9nRlmk_6 it 's how my shoulders stone creep up as i drove the air down right there 
1aJwX9nRlmk_7 stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine and an axe haley to just struck my writer toward the right shoulder taken 
1aJwX9nRlmk_8 kabul press here inhaling and exhaling and then in and out through the nose remember and then 
1aJwX9nRlmk_9 exhale you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest again when 
1hRI3vPiHjg_0 this edge weapon attack we're going to look at the cooking attack one more time 
1hRI3vPiHjg_1 i want to use a twisting or a locking type techniques 
1hRI3vPiHjg_10 to do very little to make that happen 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_13 on the ice occasionally managers come in here where these are a frost free freezers this can actually warm up where some of your ice melts together in the air agitating arm can actually get stuck 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_14 so you want to come in here and break up your suitcase 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_15 so i'm tim gibson and that are some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_2 so you want to locate where that is and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is a reset 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_3 if it is pop you want to make sure you reset it to the on position 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_4 the next thing would be to check the power cord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_5 so that's basically on the power 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_6 now if you still do not have power you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point because there could be something internal to the refrigerator 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_7 this particular refrigerator it has all electronic controls so it has its own centers which really tell you what's going on 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_8 this particular model up here if you have some food that may not be staying cool and you might check your temperature control 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_9 and this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to 
d_0dt3VdYCo_0 and ten as a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot 
d_0dt3VdYCo_1 have bali is one of those shots 
d_0dt3VdYCo_10 we just gives block at forward as you come into the net 
d_0dt3VdYCo_11 so just just a way of taking a ball 
d_0dt3VdYCo_12 cannot do much with 
d_0dt3VdYCo_13 it is blocking it forward 
d_0dt3VdYCo_14 john mcenroe was a master of this shot 
d_0dt3VdYCo_15 but you have to have it 
d_0dt3VdYCo_16 various apropos and doubles that you're able to block the ball back as if they valued at your feet you just gotta be able to block it like that 
d_0dt3VdYCo_17 so what you want to do is to see the whole basketballs 
d_0dt3VdYCo_18 armani in a row you can make 
d_0dt3VdYCo_19 see many out of fifty you can make it as the number of balls and practice improves your results on the corner also going to improve 
d_0dt3VdYCo_2 so here's a drill that helps you get the half volleys 
d_0dt3VdYCo_3 and you can use a wall which is great 
d_0dt3VdYCo_4 but in this case your practice partner in this case it will be may be throwing the ball to dare 
d_0dt3VdYCo_5 so imagine that you've had a nice shot you're coming to the net where we've had a nice servier coming to the net and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet 
d_0dt3VdYCo_6 it bounces off and you've got to just walk at forward 
d_0dt3VdYCo_7 but that's what this jaws 
d_0dt3VdYCo_8 sudan's demonstrated 
d_0dt3VdYCo_9 to throw it via speeds 
d_V_K6ziiNA_0 plants have a long and varied history throughout time and today i'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones 
d_V_K6ziiNA_1 when in rome i say go no and will teach you how to make a clove hitch 
d_V_K6ziiNA_10 i mean you can hold things were 
d_V_K6ziiNA_11 we can't put a whole lot of attention because it will slip through 
d_V_K6ziiNA_12 but it's good enough you're just trying to hold some items 
d_V_K6ziiNA_13 still that will merge 
d_V_K6ziiNA_14 school 's out our show 
d_V_K6ziiNA_15 once again and go over shrimp will go under over or standing in 
d_V_K6ziiNA_16 overlay so back under and through the loop we've created and there it is 
d_V_K6ziiNA_17 bears are clove hitch 
d_V_K6ziiNA_18 by name as rubber segunda and enjoy tying knots 
d_V_K6ziiNA_2 hitch technically isn't and not but it falls in the same category of the macrame style 
d_V_K6ziiNA_3 so we're going to do is going to look down to our table here and we can see i have my own have my oh my right here i'm going to touch my line too 
d_V_K6ziiNA_4 what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my line initially i'm going to roll it up and over and then bring it under like so 
d_V_K6ziiNA_5 going to go over the standing in that was my working and back up and over 
d_V_K6ziiNA_6 and it's going to come under and then back through the loop like so 
d_V_K6ziiNA_7 fatal 
d_V_K6ziiNA_8 this is basically to half inches put together unless you just a clove hitch 
d_V_K6ziiNA_9 and that's really tired

eY32ru3Nstc_11 those like so 
eY32ru3Nstc_12 about an ounce of orange juice

eYzmPu5FLpU_0 we are back and we're going to talk about the music alphabet 
eYzmPu5FLpU_1 so i'm sure you all know the english alphabet is twenty six letters and forgotten 
eYzmPu5FLpU_10 you might have noticed i sometimes move only one for open to the first sometimes i moved to france from seem to do 
eYzmPu5FLpU_11 i want you to think of two for it's a holster it's good terminology 
eYzmPu5FLpU_12 remember holster to france and half stamp is one friend open to one 
eYzmPu5FLpU_13 this would be important matters 
eYzmPu5FLpU_14 so we have the first stirrings g c 
eYzmPu5FLpU_15 so do you know about a thousand times and then we'll come back and we will learn some technique for the left hand will start plants and stuff and have some fun 
eYzmPu5FLpU_2 the music alphabet is much easier there is only seven letters a b c d 
eYzmPu5FLpU_3 i got there would have been embarrassing 
eYzmPu5FLpU_4 but anyway after gee we start over on a and this is important so that we can read music we can understand music and we can write music it's important to understand 
eYzmPu5FLpU_5 showing in the first string 
eYzmPu5FLpU_6 i told you earlier was the eastern after a we're gonna play the earth and the gene was the first hang onto memorably f and g k are going to go ahead and move on and the second and third string but it will take some time if this is your first time to get used to the snow 
eYzmPu5FLpU_7 such as strong as mainstream followed by c and a d c 
eYzmPu5FLpU_8 string as a gene called by j 
eYzmPu5FLpU_9 if i start on this a climb up and you can see the alphabet after a de 
eahjYz2685g_0 another important thing for you to remember and this is going to be a little difficult because we all tend to like to please people we all tend to like accolades and praise 
eahjYz2685g_1 but it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech 
eahjYz2685g_10 well the last time i did that speech everybody hated it 
eahjYz2685g_11 or everybody said i was bad 
eahjYz2685g_12 past failures of people not liking your speech or not liking you have nothing to do with present and future presentations 
eahjYz2685g_13 maybe that happened before 
eahjYz2685g_14 ok so what 
eahjYz2685g_15 by 
eahjYz2685g_16 it won't happen this time just because it happened last time 
eahjYz2685g_2 everyone does not have to love you 
eahjYz2685g_3 found that out many many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students 
eahjYz2685g_4 invariably i would have one or maybe two a semester that just they soon like me 
eahjYz2685g_5 it didn't matter what i did they didn't like me 
eahjYz2685g_6 that was 
eahjYz2685g_7 it 's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech 
eahjYz2685g_8 ok if one or two or three people don't like you 
eahjYz2685g_9 you have to continue to allow that to be ok you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker 
f-mvu_dZvjg_1 mix consumption is that the dog's tail is wagging that he's had 
f-mvu_dZvjg_10 so it's ok for adults to be curious what if they did that upsets stare 
f-mvu_dZvjg_2 while the dog wag their tails when they are about to attack as well so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail 
f-mvu_dZvjg_3 if his tail is tucked then he's afraid and that you should not be petting him at that time 
f-mvu_dZvjg_4 and never pet dog and he's afraid because it will just make them more afraid 
f-mvu_dZvjg_5 if it is laying like this and this is normal 
f-mvu_dZvjg_6 when he wagged his tail and it's about here in the middle that's happy that's a normal state of mind 
f-mvu_dZvjg_7 and when the tail starts to go up and using wagging like this that's when you can tell them your dog's probably in a more oppressive state of mind 
f-mvu_dZvjg_8 another thing about dogs when you walk into a lot of times you see their ears perk up their ears perked up in less than paying more attention 
f-mvu_dZvjg_9 but you can see a lot of time that they will get isn't tedsters when they're fixating on something and as soon as their fixating on something that's when you need to correct that because that's been obsessed with that object whether it be a person or another dog or anything like that 
f5EGPzGSCJs_0 today we're going to talk about how to diagnose and ailment of your fish 
f5EGPzGSCJs_1 carter keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them every day 
f5EGPzGSCJs_10 simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much she used when you should use water change 
f5EGPzGSCJs_11 another thing that you put can put in your tank is aquarium salt 
f5EGPzGSCJs_12 aquarium salt raises the wreck electrolytes in the take and it also helps reduce stress 
f5EGPzGSCJs_13 by name is michael it today we're talking about how to diagnose and ailment 
f5EGPzGSCJs_2 when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn they're not in rough shape they're not sitting at the bottom 
f5EGPzGSCJs_3 once you're keeping your fish for a while you're gonna know if they're acting different 
f5EGPzGSCJs_4 a common problem with fish his iq which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself 
f5EGPzGSCJs_5 a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves 
f5EGPzGSCJs_6 one thing that i like to start with it for there was a regular ailment going on is using a natural product 
f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9 we have a mellow fix an appeal effects mela fix is an anti bacterial and effects as an antifungal what i like to do is use both of them together because it's not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well 
fE6xxSbjVV8_1 if there's clay on here what happens is as you as you come down here and you start take nick clay pot see if i don't keep clean and to laugh all it does is keep going round and round around 
fE6xxSbjVV8_10 completed off it's got a lot of time 
fE6xxSbjVV8_11 jim nice smooth bottom down there 
fE6xxSbjVV8_12 applause 
fE6xxSbjVV8_2 sometimes it sticks to your pot sometimes it doesn't 
fE6xxSbjVV8_3 so when you get clan you're on your tool any tool for that matter matter clean it off set it aside 
fE6xxSbjVV8_4 so when you start with a nice clean tools so that as you take your tool touch your piece remember this is still a sticky clay does your clay trimmings doesn't transfer from your tool back on your part

fE6xxSbjVV8_8 we have a cleaner saw 
fE6xxSbjVV8_9 sometimes you just get little pieces of clay 
fslsm4MqBBE_0 an extra time on the edge of a snowboard 
fslsm4MqBBE_1 this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board 
fslsm4MqBBE_2 separately with a freestyle board it would have a complete wrapped around a free ride board would have a complete wrap around an almond board would have a complete wrap around but as he got to a job in real board that's where it might differ 
fslsm4MqBBE_3 gibran rail born towards the center of the board they already there be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire voids 
fslsm4MqBBE_4 the only other exception to the rule is the magnet traction sidewall which is a seven to its serrated edge that look something like this on either side of the void and what that is to do as it's literally supposed to cut into ice 
fslsm4MqBBE_5 fewer to have a side wall like this it might just shave off and nice top layer of it but with the serrated edge you cut right into it and do better tunes 
fux-zUwYX2Q_1 going to go over fireball 
fux-zUwYX2Q_10 but you also get to realize that eric's will be divided evenly rounded down amongst the number of targets 
fux-zUwYX2Q_2 fireball is a vein longstanding staple of the red series of this game 
fux-zUwYX2Q_3 erickson or read much like blaze 
fux-zUwYX2Q_4 however fireball is a little different 
fux-zUwYX2Q_5 fireball sorcery but repay the x damage and have a deal to a single creature or player 
fux-zUwYX2Q_6 five or as the extra added saying that you may deal damage to multiple targets 
fux-zUwYX2Q_7 so he would divide that damage evenly among the targets but you also had to pay one additional callous manner for each additional target 
fux-zUwYX2Q_8 so if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red and then you would start counting manner for the x 
fux-zUwYX2Q_9 black eyes with two three and so forth 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_0_1 ok now let's talk about turning the compost pile it's all good and you put this plan together right you don't have to turn the compost pile 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_10 we have plenty in the woods 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_11 would add your leaky your garden debris for variation and then 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_12 would start to turn your pile 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_13 the top in you and put it on the bottom is like this and 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_2 because if you layered it right and you ordered it right and you get your micro organisms and their you put the compost and novel in there he shouldn't have to turn this found 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_3 obviously this is a brand new file and we just made today 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_4 if for some reason your pile didn't cook down which mean if your pile is four feet high when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_5 in ancient cooked down it shouldn't go down and you should be able to see that it looks like campus not like this material 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_6 if you come across your file and it hasn't done those things then you're going to want to turn your pile 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_7 away we would do that is what we would do just like we did in the beginning 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_8 we would play holes in the ground so would drain good 
fyI1Ev5m1w4_9 we would create and add some more stick which we brought out of work 
1hRI3vPiHjg_11 pressed down and in the blade comes out eject the attacker away 
1hRI3vPiHjg_12 this remember i'm getting off the line 
1hRI3vPiHjg_13 counseling and do this 
1hRI3vPiHjg_14 from here i'm off the line making pause in contact with the risk 
1hRI3vPiHjg_15 already really started to sway continue in arm over and and i go 
1hRI3vPiHjg_16 press down in pop and i found 
1hRI3vPiHjg_17 eject the attacker 
1hRI3vPiHjg_2 or use the same type of set up i did here 
1hRI3vPiHjg_3 say come out similarly continue to roll it over and moving disposition here 
1hRI3vPiHjg_4 some already moving naturally in that direction again 
1hRI3vPiHjg_5 here 's my arms come here 
1hRI3vPiHjg_6 plenty to do is step as they come in here put my elbow overhears and then draw him dan and through 
1hRI3vPiHjg_7 his hand is above his elbow and cause a great deal distress and easily pop the blade 
1hRI3vPiHjg_8 from here but it's going to draw him around 
1hRI3vPiHjg_9 and as i do that my initial my inertia my spinning drags him along with me 
204P_kHHWks_0 and now i've been applying product both eyes and i'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye 
204P_kHHWks_11 opens relax and open those eyes 
204P_kHHWks_12 i look for events and these are beautifully evenly done 
204P_kHHWks_13 cnn what i would do is get ice packs out and have the before i even start the bottoms just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort i would pack ice pack arise and litter relax and take five minutes while i set up for the step two to the bottom 
279MO2nwC_E_1 in this section we're going to talk about full body movement 
279MO2nwC_E_10 do you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country running 
279MO2nwC_E_2 so what i mean by full body movement and it from your upper body down your lower body 
279MO2nwC_E_3 upper body you don't want to be timid are shy i know it's going to feel a little silly if you don't really move your arms but you should really be moving your arms 
279MO2nwC_E_4 and the reason why you'll see the arm movement a lot especially as the intensity increases in let's say you come to that hill you really want to make sure you move your arms because you're now circulating in a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body and you're getting more oxygen into your lungs and your breathing in the fresh air blowing it back out and full body movement 
279MO2nwC_E_5 as far as your lower body your legs you want to make sure that you put most of the way down your calves 
279MO2nwC_E_6 cc if i was running as running on put most of the weight on my calves and moving my body moving my arms and my shoulders 
279MO2nwC_E_7 in britain and through the nose pointed out through the mouth 
279MO2nwC_E_8 notice the difference the next time you run just remember in your mind what i said 
279MO2nwC_E_9 for more than you move your arms you're going to see yourself increasing speed and you're going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there were just very little movement 
28sgR4as6W0_0 
28sgR4as6W0_1 my name is john stewart and this is how to select an area for setting up a teen 
28sgR4as6W0_10 winter makers are logs dead trees anything like that they could possibly fall in your teen during the night 
28sgR4as6W0_11 these could leave you really really hurt at night if something like this did happen so you want to try to avoid all these things 
28sgR4as6W0_12 and lastly you want to find an area that is near other people 
28sgR4as6W0_13 public shelters and stuff like that just in case of an emergency 
28sgR4as6W0_14 and this is john stuart on how to select an area for setting up a team 
28sgR4as6W0_2 first thing you want to look for when setting up a tent in a as you want to look flat ground 
28sgR4as6W0_3 flat ground is going to be key to getting the nice solid platform setting up your team 
28sgR4as6W0_4 we don't want to find low lying areas where there's holes valleys anything like that because water will pull up if it rains and it can leak into your team 
28sgR4as6W0_5 a third thing is you don't want to find real rooted areas 
28sgR4as6W0_6 we don't want to put it in public trails 
28sgR4as6W0_7 quantifying clear areas 
28sgR4as6W0_8 that you won't have to move later when setting up the team 
28sgR4as6W0_9 also you want to look for widow makers 
2Pdxu373jgg_1 from sweet sixteen studio and i'm here to talk to you about soundproofing for a recording studio 
2Pdxu373jgg_10 is a thousand square feet and i have an air conditioner on the roof that can cool four thousand square feet 
2Pdxu373jgg_11 a recent being runs much less it's way more efficient and its quieter because i hear them install at three speed fan on it so i can turn that fan way down low and air just trickles in can hardly here 
2Pdxu373jgg_12 that way you can keep cool and record at the same time 
2Pdxu373jgg_13 ok i'm showing you the air conditioning vents inside the studio now 
2Pdxu373jgg_14 bears eight of them in this particular studio and i just want to make a point that you don't need to put those air conditioning greats over them 
2Pdxu373jgg_15 it 's better to leave those off and in fact they cost like thirty bucks each you can save yourself some bucks there 
2Pdxu373jgg_16 but leave him off so that your air just comes drifting in nice in quietly and it's not obstructed by those grace they normally put on ac unit 
2Pdxu373jgg_17 what i did there was took some foiled tape and went around the edge to make it look pretty 
2Pdxu373jgg_18 i don't know i hope you think it looks pretty to me it does 
2Pdxu373jgg_2 like to go over a few points about the air conditioning system that have installed in this studio 
2Pdxu373jgg_3 first of all located the air conditioner on the roof as far away from the studio as possible 
2Pdxu373jgg_4 its darn near on the other side of the house 
2Pdxu373jgg_5 same house because my house attached to the other side 
2Pdxu373jgg_6 silver on the side of the house 
2Pdxu373jgg_7 with pipes come in the dumps come in the studio 
2Pdxu373jgg_8 reason is self explanatory really you want to keep that sound noise out your studio 
2Pdxu373jgg_9 good point is to budget permitting if you can install an air conditioner there is a much larger than the one that you really need 
2SnVWW3MOB4_1 we 're talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shaped trays 
2SnVWW3MOB4_2 we want to reduce reduce the with at the sides so you want to go with a bob you know something short 
2SnVWW3MOB4_3 probably a little bit shorter than this but something like this would be really good 
2SnVWW3MOB4_4 diamond shaped faces needed a narrow sides and fullness at that chen so if it came down to your chain that would be really good at what sanctuary your look 
2SnVWW3MOB4_5 avoid wearing haifa on top where volume on the sides 
2SnVWW3MOB4_6 can ease some french or being to cover a narrow forehead so there's something like this would be really great right about here like this it really helps change the shape of your face and give you just have better luck throughout 
2ri5HYm48MA_0 how 
2ri5HYm48MA_10 if they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character someone from rural life that they know that that they don't know too well and 
2ri5HYm48MA_11 do is and retain their writing from that characters perspective or about that character they will think what would that person that i do how they react how would they sound how would they look kind of looked at from that perspective 
2ri5HYm48MA_12 and it's not someone that you know flipper well and so there's still a lot of imagination and creative interpretation which i think is very important and which is why they do that 
2ri5HYm48MA_13 we have this really great base where you you know the person enough that you have something he started but you don't know so well it takes away the wonder so try 
2ri5HYm48MA_14 what was your characters are not should really gave me something to start with a really great framework 
2ri5HYm48MA_2 and we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate 
2ri5HYm48MA_3 it doesn't matter if they love them or hate them or their love to hate them preferably a little of everything 
2ri5HYm48MA_4 not much site with the same character and i would be a little conflicted back with a range of characters that people are having knees and commercial experience and are able to identify with these people as they read 
2ri5HYm48MA_5 and i'm tacky primarily about stories with a short stories are novels but there's actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting advertising and if you're writing a story more for commercial 
2ri5HYm48MA_6 you still want to know how to develop good characters 
2ri5HYm48MA_7 so they can we really haven't taken when i first employee than traditional story 
2ri5HYm48MA_8 so one thing that i find it very helpful and a lot of really great writers have mentioned and neither writer schiller rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them and is to develop a really great character 
2ri5HYm48MA_9 have a little bit of information that natural that information so 
2yudAtTnZrg_1 you could see him before he which are blogging strip

30aCkh_hExI_0 once you figure it out your stance and how to push expires just to enjoy the border around 
30aCkh_hExI_1 jamie phone flashforward just cruised around 
30aCkh_hExI_2 once you get pushing regular down and available the spinning around and try pushing the other way 
30aCkh_hExI_3 with the important thing that you never want to do it started to cruise pushing around longer associated with your front foot tall we throw your direction often sit here and also to places you don't want to go 
30aCkh_hExI_4 because remember as i said in the first series aiming your front foot pretty much the determining factor in the direction that you're gonna go in 
30aCkh_hExI_5 so when you push mongo like this name with your back foot soon as you aim bag on the board you might be able to go in the direction you want to go in but more often than not somewhere that you don't want to go 
30aCkh_hExI_6 but screws round get a feel for your board feel for the ground where you started try and shirts and he can just move forward

33YRZ5UZTA4_12 feeding a purposeful just 
33YRZ5UZTA4_13 spread that paint thinner and thinner and just be frustrated in the end so this 
33YRZ5UZTA4_14 hairnets is not touching 
33YRZ5UZTA4_15 but a little dab of black their same as up here just basically 
33YRZ5UZTA4_16 everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in the white said 
33YRZ5UZTA4_17 patents and fill and everywhere that you've got to fill out a look at it and we'll wait for that to dry 
33YRZ5UZTA4_18 if the wind 
33YRZ5UZTA4_2 we have put the first coat the liner and to fill in on all three of the steps 
33YRZ5UZTA4_3 slogan blankets ready now to be so we can really start touching up the liner 
33YRZ5UZTA4_4 can really touching up the black 
33YRZ5UZTA4_5 we look at it we can see spots that that filled in and spots that didn't we don't have to worry about how these thick lines of the real really looks bad right now but we're just in the beginning stages so really 
33YRZ5UZTA4_6 we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect everywhere that we know they're going to need to add the olive the lines are filled in that we know are going to do so 
33YRZ5UZTA4_7 please take the angled brush back again the black back out and really the less paint you have on here to better just a very little on the tip of your brush discipline 
33YRZ5UZTA4_8 it needs to be filled in and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes were just 
33YRZ5UZTA4_9 and set the pain right on it still 
33jxeIIbBnM_0 but i am dave andrews 
33jxeIIbBnM_1 demonstrated how to run a macro in itself from access 
33jxeIIbBnM_10 click on your office burn 
33jxeIIbBnM_11 can save hours 
33jxeIIbBnM_12 we're going to say macro enabled work 
33jxeIIbBnM_13 name it book one and just say safe 
33jxeIIbBnM_14 and our need to go and access by clicking the start button programs microsoft office 
33jxeIIbBnM_15 it 's open access 
33jxeIIbBnM_16 we need to create a new database by clicking on the office burned and saying no 
33jxeIIbBnM_17 was going to leave the name as database one and say create 
33jxeIIbBnM_18 our new database 
33jxeIIbBnM_19 to run that macro from xl macro from access hold down the alt key on your keyboard 
33jxeIIbBnM_2 began opening epic sale 
33jxeIIbBnM_20 sanford eleven 
33jxeIIbBnM_21 which brings up the visual basic coded 
33jxeIIbBnM_22 to tap 
33jxeIIbBnM_23 stay inside 
33jxeIIbBnM_24 we're going to say module 
33jxeIIbBnM_25 when are coded or although i began talking into 
33jxeIIbBnM_26 we have our function created an access i'm going to go over whether you're a quake 
33jxeIIbBnM_27 first thing it does is it creates a variable called exhale and in the science itself 
33jxeIIbBnM_28 to create objects function launches a new excel that application scheme 
33jxeIIbBnM_29 but then opens up a excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that have typed in an inner simply says exhale that run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one 
33jxeIIbBnM_3 first create our macro by clicking the view 
33jxeIIbBnM_30 linked to this function xl test within an object in your database 
33jxeIIbBnM_31 one day rangers and i've just showed you how to run an excel macro from access 
33jxeIIbBnM_4 quantum macros and saying record macro 
33jxeIIbBnM_5 with the name this macro on just say ok 
33jxeIIbBnM_6 caused macros going to do is type the number one two three four across the top 
33jxeIIbBnM_7 pro so stop recording by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record 
33jxeIIbBnM_8 we have our macro created 
33jxeIIbBnM_9 so let's save this as a macro enabled work 
36db_jC3ftE_0 and we're going to string and put our string around the perimeter and mark the laugh reach and foot round locations 
36db_jC3ftE_1 soon our running the string and string always makes a straight line so it's very handy for very handy for determining the strip the straight lines and then from the straight line you can determine the offset to make your curve 
36db_jC3ftE_10 in the case of these days sales were using a four point one ounce cruising slashed sailing cloth from challenge 
36db_jC3ftE_11 so if you look along as edge here now we have to segmented straight lines 
36db_jC3ftE_12 what kind of approximating a curve 
36db_jC3ftE_13 but still just straight lines but we have a much better general idea of where the very edge of the sale is going to be in were not laying out more cloth and we need to 
36db_jC3ftE_14 along the foot again we're going to go about fifty percent 
36db_jC3ftE_15 where we put this pushpin will also determine where we're going to put the foot take up seem 
36db_jC3ftE_16 go for about five inches and foot round like i said 
36db_jC3ftE_17 so pleased to push fairly about five inches off the off the straight line foot 
36db_jC3ftE_18 we have a segmented line and we will transform this into a curve with the lofty in bad 
36db_jC3ftE_2 i'm going to pull the string pretty tight right here too 
36db_jC3ftE_3 we want to make sure that the string doesn't doesn't move as as we lay cloth over the top of it 
36db_jC3ftE_4 so there we have our ref sale perimeter 
36db_jC3ftE_5 so again with a pushpin come down about fifty percent and in this case we're going to be three inches of hollow 
36db_jC3ftE_6 in a larger cruising genoa he may you may want to use up to about nine inches of leach out 
36db_jC3ftE_7 not only child use will also depend on the kind of cloth or using 
36db_jC3ftE_8 moreover racing oriented say 
36db_jC3ftE_9 can run a lot less leach out because the cloth is so much stiffer 
39FN42e41r0_0 right now i'm here with personal trainers ryan reagan's berg and josie and we're doing some renegade rose 
39FN42e41r0_1 so what i want you to do is go ahead get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands or as rinds going to show his later on a little variation for it 
39FN42e41r0_10 so basically he's just don't work one side of the time 
39FN42e41r0_11 with a hand on the ground will give them a little more support and make it a little easier 
39FN42e41r0_12 and then once he does five he switched over to the other side 
39FN42e41r0_13 again for this work out we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation now wants you to work on or consider if you could do it is a push up renegade row like jones is doing here 
39FN42e41r0_14 each time you go down you going to do a push up and then come back up 
39FN42e41r0_15 it helps were a couple of different reasons helps again condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row are right 
39FN42e41r0_16 
39FN42e41r0_17 
39FN42e41r0_18 once you're done with fifteen or twenty reps grab some water meters on the next exercise in the next clip 
39FN42e41r0_2 bronzes here in a pushup position 
39FN42e41r0_3 and what you're going to do is going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your ribcage shifting your weight back and forth 
39FN42e41r0_4 if you're just starting on this you may want to work with really wide field 
39FN42e41r0_5 it will give you more balance and support as you perform all right 
39FN42e41r0_6 but at the same time he wanted a little bit more of a challenge bring your feet closer together as you work 
39FN42e41r0_7 exhale as you pull up and you feel that you really gets and use your abdominals and your blinks as you go back and forth 
39FN42e41r0_8 brian go ahead and get down 
39FN42e41r0_9 and ryan is going to do a one handed renegade roads 
3EjKvwck6ss_0 ok now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub sections what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products 
3EjKvwck6ss_1 but i have to do first is to heat the hair of a little bit of mainly young 
3EjKvwck6ss_10 make the shine stay more 
3EjKvwck6ss_11 
3EjKvwck6ss_12 basically what i do by heating up the hair and you'll notice when you put it in a kind of melts in your hair 
3EjKvwck6ss_13 it 's like putting butter 
3EjKvwck6ss_14 the heat up butter butters going to spread bettor so basically that's what they said 
3EjKvwck6ss_15 with sliced bread and butter 
3EjKvwck6ss_16 help with the dryness 
3EjKvwck6ss_17 it 's not going to it's not going to happen with the dryness 
3EjKvwck6ss_18 moisturizing conditioners what's going to help of the dryness of your hair 
3EjKvwck6ss_19 what this is going to do is just how to keep its shape what we're going for 
3EjKvwck6ss_2 it 's going to meet up the hair 
3EjKvwck6ss_20 pliable and its virus and it gives you some of that separation you want on your 
3EjKvwck6ss_21 heated up and palms and just pull it through 
3EjKvwck6ss_22 we got 
3EjKvwck6ss_23 when go into our next section 
3EjKvwck6ss_3 when i like to do is go home with my fiber pliable paste 
3EjKvwck6ss_4 why do you use that product before you go and finalize unfinished 
3EjKvwck6ss_5 i like to think about it as like getting your car payment 
3EjKvwck6ss_6 they do before they paint your car 
3EjKvwck6ss_7 primates 
3EjKvwck6ss_8 basically what this is doing for me as priming your hair and getting ready for that last shot of color 
3EjKvwck6ss_9 in this case hairspray 
3HCjTYIijec_0 it urban legends are often the on written beliefs that people have and announced to others 
3HCjTYIijec_1 well what are the unwritten rules for women about dating 
3HCjTYIijec_10_11 bear no more successful than you are the probability is you're more successful they may have their own agenda as well 
3HCjTYIijec_12 so i would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girlfriend's to give you a valid input for your choices 
3HCjTYIijec_13 and that's what it's all about 
3HCjTYIijec_14 darker pool 
3HCjTYIijec_15 your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow 
3HCjTYIijec_2 dr paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of asked dr paul 
3HCjTYIijec_3 if they're unwritten then how do we know them 
3HCjTYIijec_4 well there passed on and the best thing i can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman as a woman to give you valid information 
3HCjTYIijec_5 but guess what ladies there is equally involved with finding the answers as you are and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them 
3HCjTYIijec_6 it 's a vicious cycle 
3HCjTYIijec_7 if you have questions as i often say if you want to find out about a man why ask a woman ask a man asked dr paul 
3HCjTYIijec_8 if you are at the point where you're asking your girlfriend's for their opinions and their input then you're doing the wrong thing 
3HCjTYIijec_9 so the on written beliefs that you're going to get bad data that you need from your girlfriend's is totally absolutely unequivocally wrong 
3QhrOxFdslI_1 is seen as seen from our most recent production here at rudy vallee theater called run for your wife british farce about a cab driver with two wives into apartments 
3QhrOxFdslI_10 the audience gets more and more involved in this scene progresses 
3QhrOxFdslI_11 if she's asking the police officer wears her husband and so on and he and his family standards as well i'm right here at home 
3QhrOxFdslI_12 it gets terribly confused about that 
3QhrOxFdslI_13 one other thing is mistaken identities and trying to cover something up scenes which gets more and more bizarre as it progresses 
3QhrOxFdslI_14 sandra in fact stanley has told the policeman that he was planning to spend the morning in bed with his wife 
3QhrOxFdslI_15 so the policeman is quite surprised by how she's acting toward him and it ends up with with her screaming at him mimicking herzl this is a little for playing a game playing and that he runs out of the apartment 
3QhrOxFdslI_16 a couple of occasions this kind of brought the audience to their feet applauding at the end of the scene 
3QhrOxFdslI_17 some very very talented actors and an extremely well written seen combined to make for a really good part of the show here 
3QhrOxFdslI_2 in this scene a police officer was checking up on some reports of a missing person 
3QhrOxFdslI_3 the cab drivers friend stanley upstairs neighbor is trying to convince the police officer that he is john smith but he has the cab driver 
3QhrOxFdslI_4 france wife mary is in the sink 
3QhrOxFdslI_5 he walks into the scene after scene begins between the police officer at and stanley stanley leads to act the part of mary's husband 
3QhrOxFdslI_6 and of course he's not her husband 
3QhrOxFdslI_7 as the upstairs neighbor whom she finds extremely annoying 
3QhrOxFdslI_8 boys pestering them and borrowing money and so on 
3QhrOxFdslI_9 suddenly he's trying to show affection to her and this upsets her tremendously 
3TrMyzNWGpY_0 hi everybody i'm john grain from the martial arts teachers association and john graden dotcom 
3TrMyzNWGpY_1 how do you practice your kickboxing moves 
3TrMyzNWGpY_10 if every time you store your first move you always close the gap and your opponent calm in engage and then clear step out reopen the gap with a clearing technique electrically with a job or are clear with the front round here 
3TrMyzNWGpY_11 so i engage step in fire fire fire clear and then here's the biggie change my alignment on the bag will target and then repeat the process 
3TrMyzNWGpY_12 so we're mixing are snapping techniques with our power techniques not just doing power all the time to every attack penetrating for work engage clearing footwork change your line that's always the pattern 
3TrMyzNWGpY_13 penetrate engage claire change alignment penetrate engage clear change your mind 
3TrMyzNWGpY_14 make sure that that's the power and developing in the ring in the gym so that when you're in the ring that's how you fight comes out 
3TrMyzNWGpY_15 john gratin 
3TrMyzNWGpY_16 that helps 
3TrMyzNWGpY_17 thanks very much 
3TrMyzNWGpY_2 it 's a great question 
3TrMyzNWGpY_3 kickboxer this is one i'm particularly fond 
3TrMyzNWGpY_4 when here's a common mistake that people make when they're doing their kickboxing moves 
3TrMyzNWGpY_5 if i'm hitting the bag or i'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move 
3TrMyzNWGpY_6 will try and slammed the bag as hard as i can remember what happens when you do that is one you waste a lot of energy to tense the body up three tend to run out of gas faster 
3TrMyzNWGpY_7 if you don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how's that 
3TrMyzNWGpY_8 have techniques that i'm just going to snap i'm going to pop out there so i'm like oh snap snap snap and about every seventh or eighth or bad bow and recover 
3TrMyzNWGpY_9 power so i'm mixing my snapping speed techniques with my power techniques to every time you step and so every time you saw technique you want to make sure your penetrating with your footwork and i was not standing in one spot dig a hole 
3_15epaELCs_0 ok so we're throwing a platter here large plate 
3_15epaELCs_1 and the first thing we're going to want to do is centered the clay before we start to throw 
3_15epaELCs_10 and i'm just going to use these two parts of my hand to push the clay 
3_15epaELCs_11 and i'm going to push it back down 
3_15epaELCs_12 it's important to note that i'm not simply drawing the clay from the outside and pulling it up around the edges i'm actually squeezing the clay up into itself 
3_15epaELCs_13 whereby centering the entire piece of clay 
3_15epaELCs_14 if you have some clay at the bottom now which is throwing you off you can see how that's not on santa 
3_15epaELCs_15 simply take a rib to take that off 
3_15epaELCs_16 going to do is a few more times to demonstrate squeezing the clay up 
3_15epaELCs_17 and pushing it back down 
3_15epaELCs_18 and maybe making it look easy here and it will be frustrating if you're just starting out just sitting down and beginning to throw 
3_15epaELCs_19 you really have to do this over and over again 
3_15epaELCs_2 what i'd like to do first get the clay nice and wet 
3_15epaELCs_20 and after a while you'll get the hang of it 
3_15epaELCs_21 but don't be intimidated it doesn't work out first time it doesn't work out the first time for anyone 
3_15epaELCs_22 so we have it pretty nicely scented up 
3_15epaELCs_23 what difference it with the difference between centering clay for a pot and centering clay for something like a platter is we're actually going to make it we're going to central platform and make it much wider and we normally would 
3_15epaELCs_24 is pushing it down onto the wheel centering art form 
3_15epaELCs_25 squared up a little bit takes him access off the edge 
3_15epaELCs_26 so now we have a scented piece of clay on the back and the next thing we're going to do is enter the form and pull out the walls of this plaza 
3_15epaELCs_27 and we'll be doing that in the next part of this lesson 
3_15epaELCs_3 and the first thing i'd like to do is push the clay down onto the wheel to make sure it's stuck like so 
3_15epaELCs_4 is pushing down on the clay to make sure it's nicely stuck onto the back 
3_15epaELCs_5 cannot centering is a process of squeezing the clay up through your hands and pushing it back down and as you push it back down your your forcing the clay onto the center of the wheel 
3_15epaELCs_6 i'm going to use this part of my hand to force them to santa 
3_15epaELCs_7 and i'm going to lock that into a part of my body and my gut here so that i have nice control 
3_15epaELCs_8 i'm going to use this part of my hand to push the clay back down and push it onto the surface 
3_15epaELCs_9 first we're going to bring it up 
3hqV8qx75YE_0 one of the most important things about drawing are coming up with ideas is having a sketchbook 
3hqV8qx75YE_1 and that's a place where you can draw whatever it is that you want 
3hqV8qx75YE_10 it is an actual study of this and sometimes i'm just messing around and doing whatever i feel like and have beautiful aren't like this that's quality 
3hqV8qx75YE_11 i can put that my sketchbook and nobody is going to judge me in the art world because it's my sketchbook and i can put one on one 
3hqV8qx75YE_12 so first you have to get a sketchbook then you have to just scribble all over it so that there is nothing that's keeping you nothing that's blocking you from letting out whatever idea is that inside you that you want to get on on paper 
3hqV8qx75YE_13 and you have to be able to be comfortable scribbling in his sketchbook before you're going to be comfortable drawing on an actual drawing there isn't an expensive piece of paper that means something to you that it's going to be a piece of art in the end 
3hqV8qx75YE_2 and you don't have to worry about whether or not it looks 
3hqV8qx75YE_3 sketchbook isn't a place that you keep all your best drawings and even any good drawings 
3hqV8qx75YE_4 it 's just where you doodle ideas you just kind of let your pen flow 
3hqV8qx75YE_5 and you don't have to worry about 
3hqV8qx75YE_6 it 's like your personal diary 
3hqV8qx75YE_7 so i just want to flip through this is my actual sketchbook 
3hqV8qx75YE_8 some studies in here and like some of it looks good looks on finish 
3hqV8qx75YE_9 i mean a lot of it doesn't make any sense 
3sZjSNcqXpI_1 depending on your style of play if you like to play offense defense should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field 
3sZjSNcqXpI_2 but through rain to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see that the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates to move forward 
3sZjSNcqXpI_3 of defense isn't your thing he liked to play more of an offense when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense 
3sZjSNcqXpI_4 classroom where the teammates of the other team or so you can be able to be able to not get shada from an area where you're not looking 
3sZjSNcqXpI_5 for playing offense and europe front make sure you laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team for not shooting at you 
3uIuLtqdmqU_0 now i want to make a kind of the santa fe style palm 
3uIuLtqdmqU_1 as the ones that are going to come out at the bottom when they come in like that usually their hand built coil built and then after they set up you take a stone to and you burn a shit up real nice and they make that make it real shiny 
3uIuLtqdmqU_2 so start by not coil building it as i got this we'll hear you want to start centering your claim the 
3uIuLtqdmqU_3 but all atlanticists or i might cry from the wheel head to a bigger if you are 
3uIuLtqdmqU_4 you want to come down like your hands lock your legs like your arms and legs paring down on it while we alleging and you're setting a piece of clay 
3uIuLtqdmqU_5 prairie chapel have that 
3uIuLtqdmqU_6 and when you turn parts it's kind of a little bit more important to make sure that it's nice and center for little stafford's it's all right so our center but if you're going through a pot that's going to really be a pain in class and correctly 
3uIuLtqdmqU_7 whereas centered 
3wVrsesGaI4_0 and we're talking about the holidays and howard defining the lines in the techniques that were using 
3wVrsesGaI4_1 as you can see i'm depth and each time 
3wVrsesGaI4_10 and you see that to find it and tighten up the edges 
3wVrsesGaI4_11 we will bring over here and a thud 
3wVrsesGaI4_12 is used in the seven mag to sign up the edges of the lines which is which is fine in cases like this 
3wVrsesGaI4_13 we're just going to continue on 
3wVrsesGaI4_2 some petroleum jelly at work in an area 
3wVrsesGaI4_3 some of this area of top 
3wVrsesGaI4_4 and you could see how i've titan these lines 
3wVrsesGaI4_5 and here's an example woman to do 
3wVrsesGaI4_6 and this curved line right here as you can see in this segment at line take the seven mag work at an angle 
3wVrsesGaI4_7 bacteria in the find a line or moving down 
3wVrsesGaI4_8 wind down their agony the violet why moving up a small great emotion 
3wVrsesGaI4_9 completely prop part of it 
3xni-I6N3EY_1 system of medicine has been around for over five thousand years 
3xni-I6N3EY_2 before recorded history between one hundred b c and two hundred a d the yellow emperors classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon the tiny continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across 
3xni-I6N3EY_3 observation as a key point 
3xni-I6N3EY_4 it was sacra biggest dissected the human body so the systems of acupuncture accu pressure as well as use of herbs all came about through trial and error there was an observation of the of the constellations of the stars and an idea of reflective of the macro and micro so that points were developed for the purposes of releasing this natural flow of cheap 
3xni-I6N3EY_5 in this next segment will talk about the six external causes of illness 
40JRPcYZkWg_1 if you look out on the market you're gonna find a lot of different types of equipment 
40JRPcYZkWg_2 with two big ones i want to talk about though right now or metal versus plastic 
40JRPcYZkWg_3 if you remember to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat 
40JRPcYZkWg_4 typically if you find metal processors you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better 
40JRPcYZkWg_5 we also want to look for good mixing as well 
40JRPcYZkWg_6 but also because we are dealing with a flammable substance from ethanol it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tank 
40JRPcYZkWg_7 also if your heating within the tank you don't want your tanked melton yet so i recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks 
40JRPcYZkWg_8 do your research look hard but look look for the plastic looked for the metal see which ones work the best for you 
40JRPcYZkWg_9 again calling it referrals but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with with metal tanks 
43X_QWkIxxg_0 now i've taught you and the leg and pass series but i'm going to go over it again discussing more the structure of learning body throws in preparation for learning things like bat crosses over the shoulders and penguin catches 
43X_QWkIxxg_1 now as i talked about in the last clip you need to practice getting the trip down one at a time and it's very important to keep good posture and good head position and not be scrambling all over the place to make your catch 
43X_QWkIxxg_2 now always start with one object and for on the leg always remember to bring a leg up to you 
43X_QWkIxxg_3 if you start to lean towards your leg your tendency to be either the throw out or you won't be able to see what's coming down so you can catch it 
43X_QWkIxxg_4 if you bring your leg up to you it takes more energy from the waist town but you can work your agility and it will also make the throw and catch much worry it's much easier 
43X_QWkIxxg_5 when learning to put them all together with any body throw you want to have a structured practice 
43X_QWkIxxg_6 in short control runs as i've mentioned before a very important but also the pattern what you throw them every third throw jugglers tennis maybe every third throw alternating 
43X_QWkIxxg_7 you can mix up the pattern but it's important to get it down 
43X_QWkIxxg_8 you may also want to practice your balance with under the leg by just doing it constantly on one side 
43X_QWkIxxg_9 this is a whole different trick but it may help with some things 
46Cwjrd4ua4_0 the next environmental factors that you want to look at our the date in the year 
46Cwjrd4ua4_1 when does this take place 
46Cwjrd4ua4_10 is it taking place in the summer 
46Cwjrd4ua4_11 the phone 
46Cwjrd4ua4_12 a sprain 
46Cwjrd4ua4_13 these are really important things because let's say it's taking place in new orleans and the summer 
46Cwjrd4ua4_14 that means it's going to be hot and muggy and that's going to directly affect how your characters going to respond 
46Cwjrd4ua4_15 or is it taking place in north dakota in the winter where it's very very cold 
46Cwjrd4ua4_16 that will affect how your character react in response and moves and so forth and so on 
46Cwjrd4ua4_17 you also need to take a look at the time period in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this player movie take place 
46Cwjrd4ua4_18 gray 
46Cwjrd4ua4_19 a week 
46Cwjrd4ua4_2 nine hundred and twelve 
46Cwjrd4ua4_20 is it a mine 
46Cwjrd4ua4_21 is that a year 
46Cwjrd4ua4_22 everything usually take place in the morning or in the middle of the night or in the daytime 
46Cwjrd4ua4_23 all of those things can affect how your character 
46Cwjrd4ua4_24 also you will also want to take into consideration the date 
46Cwjrd4ua4_25 meaning and are there any specific holidays 
46Cwjrd4ua4_26 does it take place on a sunday 
46Cwjrd4ua4_27 what do people usually do on sunday 
46Cwjrd4ua4_28 is that take place on a monday 
46Cwjrd4ua4_29 what are we usually doing on a mandate 
46Cwjrd4ua4_3 the nineteen sixties 
46Cwjrd4ua4_30 take place over st patricks day or presidents day or christmas 
46Cwjrd4ua4_31 taken to affect all of those environmental factors 
46Cwjrd4ua4_4 a two thousand and eight 
46Cwjrd4ua4_5 in the future 
46Cwjrd4ua4_6 having real important to know what time period because people acted differently the social norms were different in different time periods 
46Cwjrd4ua4_7 we also want to take a look at the seas 
46Cwjrd4ua4_8 what time of year does this take place 
46Cwjrd4ua4_9 and it could change throughout the player the movie but is it taking place in the winter

4VXvnpxTEEw_8 just cross reference take real taste for temperature mature after passports 
4VXvnpxTEEw_9 the creation of the temperature ten to fifteen degrees 
4VdzmWyNsxY_0 in this clip we will talk about different types of breast implants 
4VdzmWyNsxY_1 there are two essential types different types of implants 
4VdzmWyNsxY_2 when the implant is filled with a silicone gel and the other implant is filled with saltwater are sailing 
4VdzmWyNsxY_3 traditionally the silicone gel filled implants have been the preference of most plastic surgeons because of the qualities of the gel in that there is a better cohesiveness and softness possibly less rippling and a more natural feel to the implant 
4VdzmWyNsxY_4 what happened was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two the silicone gel implants were taken off the market because there was concerned that the silicone gel would potentially leak out of the implant and then cause diseases in the body 
4VdzmWyNsxY_5 sixteen years later just a few years ago it was decided to allow them to be released back onto the market again with certain restrictions in that people would have to make sure to follow certain guidelines as with being only over a twenty two to have silicone gel filled breast implants and then having an mri which is a special type of x ray done later in the future to make sure that there was no problem with the implant 
4VdzmWyNsxY_6 this after of course all of the evidence weight of evidence showed that it was very unlikely that there were serious systemic effects from the silicone breast implants 
4XgOVMG-zIo_0 and i'm going to show you how to make a blue bird 
4XgOVMG-zIo_1 this drink is stirred not shaken so you don't need much ice 
4XgOVMG-zIo_10 despite its blue for flavor it has an orange tastes behind it 
4XgOVMG-zIo_11 to add a couple of dashes of bitters still have that handy 
4XgOVMG-zIo_12 with just a couple 
4XgOVMG-zIo_13 began 
4XgOVMG-zIo_14 and then you're going to start to have your sister available 
4XgOVMG-zIo_15 put it in the sit around just like that 
4XgOVMG-zIo_16 
4XgOVMG-zIo_17 and then you're going to strain it into a glass 
4XgOVMG-zIo_18 so grab your class heavier strainer available and gently poured in 
4XgOVMG-zIo_19 like so 
4XgOVMG-zIo_2 so take a put it into your glasses 
4XgOVMG-zIo_20 when you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist in twist 
4XgOVMG-zIo_21 for and just like that but in your strong and then you have pooper 
4XgOVMG-zIo_3 going to add an hour and a half of gin 
4XgOVMG-zIo_4 so get your jigger 
4XgOVMG-zIo_5 warren an ounce flip it over and add half an ounce 
4XgOVMG-zIo_6 and you're going to add an ounce of triple sec actually half an ounce of triple sec

4XgOVMG-zIo_8 the small side of that 
4XgOVMG-zIo_9 if you're gonna do half an ounce of the flu caraco 
4XlVMRXLydg_0 view gathering she from heaven and earth 
4XlVMRXLydg_1 can watch it should if you'd like to follow along with me be great 
4XlVMRXLydg_10 so many movements and she gun that when you learn a great amount to chew gum you can pick what she would like to do what your body can can handle 
4XlVMRXLydg_11 
4XlVMRXLydg_12 real simple one is gathering chief from heaven and earth 
4XlVMRXLydg_13 what i'd like to do is demonstrate the forum for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this 
4XlVMRXLydg_14 we always want to start out in the who will cheap posture 
4XlVMRXLydg_15 first one always stand the will 
4XlVMRXLydg_16 you work your way from the feet up to the top of the 
4XlVMRXLydg_17 once you do that when you go to you 
4XlVMRXLydg_18 within inhale 
4XlVMRXLydg_19 hill 
4XlVMRXLydg_2 but gather chief from heaven and earth one of the things in cheek on what's great about she dome is that the movements can be very very simple 
4XlVMRXLydg_20 from here once you have a feeling of peace and focus the mind isn't racing around anymore that you're very calm and relax let speak in the movement 
4XlVMRXLydg_21 then begin the posture and the movement of what we're going to juice which is gathering she from heaven and earth 
4XlVMRXLydg_3 we don't have to do any complex movements here 
4XlVMRXLydg_4 complex movements later on in higher levels of chewing gum 
4XlVMRXLydg_5 what the wonderful thing about she gum is that she gung can be done it with any age group 
4XlVMRXLydg_6 age group 
4XlVMRXLydg_7 have movements in she go that eighty year olds can do nine year olds can do 
4XlVMRXLydg_8 we have movements and she goes that require a stronger flexibility more deterrence and so on 
4XlVMRXLydg_9 the point to this is that when we do chico you can do so many different movements 
58jqBSopR3s_0 when you talk about color you can't forget the neutrals 
58jqBSopR3s_1 that 's you know there are times when you need grace there are times when you need colors that just aren't colors and obviously with soon as you say craigie think black and white make great 
58jqBSopR3s_10 the answer to that is actually to try to use all the colors in a way without getting too much stuff 
58jqBSopR3s_11 so i've got my purple or violent and i'm going to i know that has red and blue and 
58jqBSopR3s_12 so i've got my yellow and i'm going to add some yellow to it and i'm going to stick with the darker yellow for now so that i don't get to messed up here 
58jqBSopR3s_13 we still have to pay a dell purple 
58jqBSopR3s_14 this is really this qualifies as the doll purple 
58jqBSopR3s_2 indeed here is a classic value scale 
58jqBSopR3s_3 black painted the bottom white paint at the top and thinness i try to get sort of even increments of grays between light and dark 
58jqBSopR3s_4 the average value scale is generally like between nine and twelve steps 
58jqBSopR3s_5 it 's sort of like a scale 
58jqBSopR3s_6 so this is a scale of black to white 
58jqBSopR3s_7 and now in color you know the gray is obviously doesn't seem to have any color and neutral really does mean when you can't really make up your mind with the color is 
58jqBSopR3s_8 we played good without a little bit and saturation we're going to play with just a little bit more and do some adjusting 
58jqBSopR3s_9 so i'm going to go back here in yellow and violet range and see if i can get something that is how gray how close to a grey can i get without really without using black and white 
5BFff-4A_aA_0 so we've been working on directional rolling and as we've discussed we are talking about five degree incremental 
5BFff-4A_aA_1 well as five degree incremental increase you can't roll down the long part of your body anymore 
5BFff-4A_aA_10 king 
5BFff-4A_aA_11 now ladies going to go back but it's only going to go to the other leg 
5BFff-4A_aA_12 or you can also stretch it out 
5BFff-4A_aA_13 i prefer to stretch it out it gets closer to the ground faster 
5BFff-4A_aA_14 so what happens is stretch it out lean into it go ahead and touch the floor 
5BFff-4A_aA_15 we're going to use a slight kick off with this leg to give yourself some projection into them into the side direction 
5BFff-4A_aA_16 a number zero ninety degrees 
5BFff-4A_aA_17 why should be able to see the whole time 
5BFff-4A_aA_18 so it's across the back across the shoulders but your instead of going across your body you're having to go across your wingspan and your shoulder blades 
5BFff-4A_aA_2 we have to start changing the angle as the angle increases 
5BFff-4A_aA_3 and the closer you get to ninety degrees the more you have to be going across your shoulders 
5BFff-4A_aA_4 so as it approaches ninety degrees regardless because it's essentially a forward role until you hit ninety degrees 
5BFff-4A_aA_5 we 're just getting used to the idea of falling from an aspect that you're not used to 
5BFff-4A_aA_6 so if this is my zero line and that's my ninety degrees at forty five you're still essentially doing a forward role but there's more on the shoulder 
5BFff-4A_aA_7 and as i said as it approaches ninety you're moving more across the shoulders 
5BFff-4A_aA_8 so how do we do this with that killing ourselves 
5BFff-4A_aA_9 we started the same way we started the break for nor the beginnings of break for in which the legos bag 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_0 hi my name is floyd i'm talking to you today from the acoustic musician dot com and sand utah and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_1 the most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_2 that is this line here and what it is is it each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_3 would be your high he would be your loewi and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_4 now the line appear as standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read 
5Gw0TpbCMTQ_5 but this just shows finger position and and and no placement on the strings to be able to play the play the guitar 
5RR7dlzkyL0_0 first of all i want to tell you when you are doing business over the phone you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate 
5RR7dlzkyL0_1 what i'm talking about is no longer do you have any nonverbals to work 
5RR7dlzkyL0_2 on the other end of that phone that can't see your face that can't see your body they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment 
5RR7dlzkyL0_3 so basically all your left where is your tone of voice 
5RR7dlzkyL0_4 your attitude which comes through in your tone of voice and this is what you have to work with 
5RR7dlzkyL0_5 this is what will convey your professionalism 
5RR7dlzkyL0_6 this is what will convey your willingness to listen and to help and to be a professional 
5RR7dlzkyL0_7 so it's very important that we focus on the specific 
5iyYqy4gqEI_0 
5iyYqy4gqEI_10 it comes in the silver and gold so you can choose whatever color you would like for your project 
5iyYqy4gqEI_11 you can also get it at the hardware store in a black color 
5iyYqy4gqEI_12 so this is a doll black color 
5iyYqy4gqEI_13 is a two thousand and four gauge its black if you would like that color 
5iyYqy4gqEI_14 sometimes on the internet you can find different colors 
5iyYqy4gqEI_15 used a black red pink 
5iyYqy4gqEI_16 for this project a rat or a green would be cute 
5iyYqy4gqEI_17 we're just going to use the silver today 
5iyYqy4gqEI_2 i'd like to tell you about the wire that i use 
5iyYqy4gqEI_3 the wire for the bracelets right here are twenty four gauge wire 
5iyYqy4gqEI_4 comes in a school of twenty five yards and i just buy it at wal mart 
5iyYqy4gqEI_5 and this is the mortgage 
5iyYqy4gqEI_6 q you can use twenty six guides twenty eight games 
5iyYqy4gqEI_7 they are thinner easy to crochet 
5iyYqy4gqEI_8 twenty two gauge twenty gauge is really stiff and it's it's really hard to crochet 
5iyYqy4gqEI_9 similar that you can't even crochet 
BIUNqI3uCMw_0 one of the most common faults in we'll thrown pottery is an aircraft 
BIUNqI3uCMw_1 this is a typical shallow as crack which can form either in the drawing stage when the piece reaches the bone dry stage or it can be noticed in the disk firing stage or in the glaze firing stage 
BIUNqI3uCMw_2 and it occurs from the clay platelets not being online correctly 
BIUNqI3uCMw_3 essentially at fault caused by improper technique on throwing on the wheel 
BIUNqI3uCMw_4 it can be easily aleve alleviated and certain clay bodies are more forgiving of improper technique and others 
BIUNqI3uCMw_5 certain clay bodies are not as forgiving 
BIUNqI3uCMw_6 but it comes down to handling the clay correctly on the wheel and performing the proper wedging procedures before it gets to the wheel 
BIUNqI3uCMw_7 and what that will do is a line all the clay platelets in the correct direction and they'll be stable on trying 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_1 a minimum one by three counter buttons are run vertical and center to or existing rafters 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_2 moisture membrane of felt try flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lab to allow the membrane to loop over the counter abandoned 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_3 the main framing and details are then continued 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_4 care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_5 cats and penetrations should be sealed with tape 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_6 in a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a backset feature you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles 
BL4ZqiUZO1U_7 in order to hold the panels in plain you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of that usually a one inch wide board will suffice 
BMXB5nth8hA_1 with the kelly weitzman today we're going to tell you how to buy a house

BtG-2TZ5Cnk_4 once again this is something that we don't sell a whole lot of these days but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all at their stories chlorine

C0fPZgeY2rg_0 how does a snake grow 
C0fPZgeY2rg_1 well it's a good question 
C0fPZgeY2rg_10 obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they're going to shed a lot less but they do you still need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales repair any damage their male occurred and and continue on with their healthy life 
C0fPZgeY2rg_2 snakes grohl is kind of different way than we do 
C0fPZgeY2rg_3 people shed scale skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around 
C0fPZgeY2rg_4 snakes scales are a little different they're more like an armor coating on the outside and then it will allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like dragged down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake well not really too much of a baby anymore 
C0fPZgeY2rg_5 what they do is they they they rubbed their head against something here's the head over here 
C0fPZgeY2rg_6 how to get something to split their skin and then slowly rolled off some kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out 
C0fPZgeY2rg_7 when it comes off limits inside out 
C0fPZgeY2rg_8 and you can actually see all the individual little scales on the top and you can see all of the belly skills and the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snakes 
C0fPZgeY2rg_9 baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really berries as to how often they are going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they're growing 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_0 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_11 and now we're were up to where the rip begins and we're going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter of an eighth of an inch stitches and now we're going to go across the rip we're going to enter here again 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_12 about an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip to 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_13 as long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle and and and it won't it won't be coming out there 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_14 we pull that through 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_15 see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rare and let me get a few more and then i'll show you what to do 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_16 so then once we get a bunch of those and we're going to pull them very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_17 it almost looks like a scene 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_18 the smaller the stitches the more delicate repair will be 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_2 so i'm going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_3 here 's our rip and if you're doing a real repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_4 branches closely as possible but for purposes of showing you and so that you can see exactly what i'm doing and what the stitch looks like i'm going to use of black thread 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_5 it should make it easier for you to see 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_6 now start with you want to not your friend like i showed you the nice could not and we're going to come up from the back of the garments about a half an inch from the start of the rip 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_7 we 're gonna come up in from the back to the front of the fabric and then you're going to make a deal go back in just a very small amount like centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch probably an eighth of an inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you'll go on the opposite side of it where you came out to go in and take again about an eighth or somewhere between a quarter an eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_8 we're going to start very small and close your little wider a little wider and you'll see what we're going to get 
C4lsh3mZ4jU_9_10 and here we go so now you use stitches start out small bigger bigger and their straight up and down perpendicular to the rip and barren eighth of an inch and go in down here 
C6fVNI9QLYU_1 and you can't see it so i'm going to have to explain it but it is not a box lives so whatever when you haven't at an angle whatever whenever catches on this i was going to write down and go to run out that size or you're going to have had a stockpile down at the end 
C6fVNI9QLYU_2 gathered up on both sides and bring it through 
C6fVNI9QLYU_3 it'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or and location dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side 
C6fVNI9QLYU_4 this this unlike the box blade is not box hand and so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and will eventually go over to the side 
C6fVNI9QLYU_5 when you want that for snow removal or or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road after the side of the road and that's what this kind of played with before 
C9ordUxwOEQ_0 tire gauge 
C9ordUxwOEQ_1 and you can adjust the pressure of the tire then you change tire pressure every time you come in different non track conditions jagged continues unchanged every single time you go out there 
C9ordUxwOEQ_2 really living in god's the number gauge on it 
C9ordUxwOEQ_3 especially dive into that vow and it will show you a re 
C9ordUxwOEQ_4 read the text and you just have higher pressure with this little button and it just looked air out of the time 
C9ordUxwOEQ_5 it's really easy to use 
C9ordUxwOEQ_6 tire air pressure in the tires by an air tank it is pressurized which thin thin thin and spreading pressure and the tires that our friends 
C9ordUxwOEQ_7 on how much to drag is changing experiments only one or two sides that you're taking in or out of the tire 
CFRh_KOT9nY_0 this is john and in this clip will be talking about the portable shop table 
CFRh_KOT9nY_1 as you begin to accessorize your wood shop you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table 
CFRh_KOT9nY_2 will notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs and at the other side we just have our standard feet 
CFRh_KOT9nY_3 and now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily will it to the next station maybe you're going to a table saw or a planar 
CFRh_KOT9nY_4 now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic uncomfortable or if you're looking for more of a custom mobile workbench you can always go online and search for free mobile workbench plans and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself 
CFRh_KOT9nY_5 you'll notice that are workbench fear in the shop is made of metal 
CFRh_KOT9nY_6 now if the surface gets scratched it will scratch your lumber so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it goes gets scratched you could refinish it and make it smoothes again 
CO6qyvvglAE_0 that will go on to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board 
CO6qyvvglAE_1 here we have the den in d c six thirty five cd player 
CO6qyvvglAE_10 important things you need to know about the player is when you want to change tracks use this button that's called push and you turned sideways 
CO6qyvvglAE_11 don't push it turn it sideways 
CO6qyvvglAE_12 and you can see the track numbers is advancing 
CO6qyvvglAE_13 one two three 
CO6qyvvglAE_14 ok 
CO6qyvvglAE_15 so there we go 
CO6qyvvglAE_16 it 's a change tracks 
CO6qyvvglAE_17 and when you're ready to play hit flay obviously 
CO6qyvvglAE_18 and now a great feature of the cd player is if you decide this is the track you want instead of hitting pause which just pauses it or hitting stop which actually would bring you back to track one you can hits go find to find the track you want again track three in this case 
CO6qyvvglAE_19 play 
CO6qyvvglAE_2 has many features 
CO6qyvvglAE_20 that's what i want 
CO6qyvvglAE_21 then you hit the queue button and what that does is is it brings you back to the beginning of track three 
CO6qyvvglAE_22 so find your find your track with the turning this button that says push on and paradoxically 
CO6qyvvglAE_23 then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play 
CO6qyvvglAE_3 some of which are fantastically useful 
CO6qyvvglAE_4 play some music here 
CO6qyvvglAE_5 question 
CO6qyvvglAE_6 so what has your basic cd cd player features 
CO6qyvvglAE_7 stop obviously 
CO6qyvvglAE_8 play with 
CO6qyvvglAE_9 pause no surprise there 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_0 another very good use although a slightly more risky use of awaiting wedge is carrying a backboard across moving current 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_1 while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationary and study in a way this is a last resort so you can use them 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_2 we need a lot of people the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where its position in the middle 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_3 head should be at the front so that way if the feet get dropped into the water the water will tend to plain the blackboard up to the surface of the water 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_4 about old times during this way you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the blackboard 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_5 if at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board 
CSxgJLYMLZ4_6 if you have the opportunity to do this that person should be facing downstream over them in a better position to maintain the airway 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_0 it was a little shadows to our selection here 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_1 so as you can see we got our sandy text 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_10 and arrogant 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_11 get a little rough texture going on here 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_12 seems pretty good 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_13 and click any allays looks 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_14 and let's take or noise and we're just going to leave or noise at zero 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_15 so everything looks pretty good right now so we're going to go ahead and illness 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_16 and as you can see we got a little bit of a little bit going on here with little outlying color and whatnot so we're going to do is we're going to pause here it will pick this up in the next part 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_2 double click here 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_3 going to drop shadow is like that of course emerge motors and multiply and pass he is at seventy five and i like that so far 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_4 switch or angle will switch and around to see was thirty look way it looks pretty good 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_5 will put it there and let's say our distance stickers distance of just a couple more pixels seven looks pretty good take are spread let's take it out quite a bit here we go now it's kind of gotten pretty pretty funky here 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_6 take her size it will take it down to zero 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_7 it's not so funky notions barely there 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_8 scientists around the corners of our thing 
CW9w6M_1Vrk_9 inlets shoes and new contour for this school ahead and click here and let's use let's use this one right here 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_1 in this clip we're going to talk about what you do once you get on top of the ramp 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_10 petals always want to be on the three and nine i remember medium speed 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_2 as i said in the overview you're going to want to get as much as your way up on the front tires possible 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_3 we also want to get a spin in there so basically you come up the ramp and you want to get a little bit of a hop and in this way or this way whichever way you feel comfortable spending 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_4 it on the front tire squeezing the brake and rotating 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_5 when you've cleared the lip here a little bit that we don't roll back into it when you get right about here that's when you want to let go of the break 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_6 we 're also going to want a little bit of lean into your tire that we are momentum doesn't just tip you off 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_7 you want to enter the ramp a little bit and that will help with your rotating too 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_8 if you're going too fast you're going to fly up over the bars 
Cw8gcO9TXRo_9 if you're gone to slow you're just going to slam your back down 
CzkLI34HFIg_0 so i'm going to take these hands over and go ahead impress them down 
CzkLI34HFIg_1 and i'm going to show you how we're going to mark were really cut off the pants 
CzkLI34HFIg_10 so now that i have this press still going to go ahead and flip these pants back out because only to see that makes its fabric psa can determine where i'm going to cut it off 
CzkLI34HFIg_11 came here we go 
CzkLI34HFIg_12 when i do this if i have to cover the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside 
CzkLI34HFIg_13 there is a good idea just in case say someone else wants to wear them they'll have a little bit to work 
CzkLI34HFIg_14 if they need to let the him because you can still wears the pants hours to have some original him left 
CzkLI34HFIg_15 so i'm going to start right here worked with their that one little seen that also myself in look on it 
CzkLI34HFIg_16 
CzkLI34HFIg_17 this sign also on the side 
CzkLI34HFIg_18 he saw the railing 
CzkLI34HFIg_19 so in in a minute i'm going to show you how i'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off 
CzkLI34HFIg_2 solar cover your to my work table slash earning table in here we go 
CzkLI34HFIg_20 and i'll show you how to do that next 
CzkLI34HFIg_3 so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and earnest down just like i did the other leg just kind of pull a tiny bit like we go 
CzkLI34HFIg_4 which grow our right here along the same 
CzkLI34HFIg_5 like i said before i like doing they're just because i know the fabric is right where it's supposed to be you give it that we will press 
CzkLI34HFIg_6 standing 
CzkLI34HFIg_7 i 'm going to open it up in the crease that i put me 
CzkLI34HFIg_8 we don't want to do the enzyme also 
CzkLI34HFIg_9 we 've already done that's what some 's gonna get out can do it 
D4NatJnEMBU_1 bouquet sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and occasion cooking are sausage making that stuff about just about anything 
D4NatJnEMBU_2 two k scenes in the sausage you can do rabbit can do ghosts can do chicken turkey catfish i mean basically anything 
D4NatJnEMBU_3 the trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well what those meat that you use or they're fascinating 
D4NatJnEMBU_4 today we're going to do as a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and we're going to use some pork to actually bind together 
D4NatJnEMBU_5 another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg white to created by 
D4NatJnEMBU_6 for this recipe we're going to do some a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our feelings so let's get started 
DB2ulH-egkg_0 what we'll do at this point is not the blanks on a mandarin 
DB2ulH-egkg_1 when she take off the excess pushing center nudge slide your blank on the second bushings 
DB2ulH-egkg_2 these are important because they'll size you on each end 
DB2ulH-egkg_3 and now that we couldn't put the second blank on because it's a little bit too long so we'll use a spacer a washer and not to hold the pieces 
DB2ulH-egkg_4 it has a number to taper to fit this and and you'll see at this and there's a conical conical hole 
DB2ulH-egkg_5 way this works you'll see it into the man drove into the spindle and bring up your tail stock a cone center in it and bring it up snug 
DB2ulH-egkg_6 titan 
DB2ulH-egkg_7 if you tighten it you're going to cause this to bow and it's going to cause a cause of vibration 
DEdVsXBut4I_0 to suited ace three suited this is pretty much the best omaha high low hand because it gives you gives you the aces when the high if you catch another acer too 
DEdVsXBut4I_1 it gives you suited to suit at age three 
DEdVsXBut4I_2 with these you can pick up a high of a straight you can pick up a high of a flesh and you can pick up a high of a straight flush 
DEdVsXBut4I_3 so you have a number of ways to win the high also you have a number of ways to win the low 
DEdVsXBut4I_4 what does that mean visually 
DEdVsXBut4I_5 well let's look at this board here that i've laid out 
DEdVsXBut4I_6 we've got a board of jack ten eight three and five and our opponent has played a rather dubious hand for omaha high low 
DEdVsXBut4I_7 but played it nonetheless and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to the queen 
DEdVsXBut4I_8 alas he does not when the low with his five to he doesn't qualify for low because he matches the five 
DEdVsXBut4I_9 we on the other hand have a low hand we have eight five three deuce ace so we would win half the pot 
DGTh2riWSg4_1 scimitars leone and scimitars another very powerful artifact equipment 
DGTh2riWSg4_10 again this is very important and makes it a very powerful cars 
DGTh2riWSg4_2 once again he had to put it in play and attach it to a creature through its equipped cost to put this in the play and honor creature 
DGTh2riWSg4_3 again it's an uncommon at the basic black 
DGTh2riWSg4_4 once again the basic block is currently in tenth edition as we see from the icon 
DGTh2riWSg4_5 an uncommon to me as a costume forty if a decent at your local gaming store 
DGTh2riWSg4_6 leon instant scimitar caution you want to put them play in costume on a quick 
DGTh2riWSg4_7 means it costs you to take what pathetic creature 
DGTh2riWSg4_8 well with this cause you're going to get a plus one plus one on targeted creature which doesn't seem that great for two but remember that when that creature goes to a graveyard this stays and boy 
DGTh2riWSg4_9 so the next creature all and take one to equip it to that creature 
DKJtnSrjIro_0 we have the bottom prepared and we've got our little ball that has the pedestal and this is set up as well 
DKJtnSrjIro_1 but also as leather hard 
DKJtnSrjIro_10 so again i'm going to spend it and i'm going to top it answered 
DKJtnSrjIro_11 and pressed down in the middle he notices flood at first that was the suction releasing 
DKJtnSrjIro_12 pressed down in the middle and that recreates that section 
DKJtnSrjIro_13 so it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center 
DKJtnSrjIro_14 and next will criminal 
DKJtnSrjIro_2 and as you can see when i set it on their if the too big 
DKJtnSrjIro_3 it doesn't quite slip into that pedestals 
DKJtnSrjIro_4 so i have to trim this as well 
DKJtnSrjIro_5 what i need to do in order to trim this first you want to get the wheel headway 
DKJtnSrjIro_6 this is important because i just use section for hold my pieces to the wheel 
DKJtnSrjIro_7 and that's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against the sweat peace and i'm going to drop it kind of hard 
DKJtnSrjIro_8 now it sucked on there 
DKJtnSrjIro_9 from hitting and it's not moving 
DKOzSnHwSFI_0 my name is dave shinok and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing 
DKOzSnHwSFI_1 some of the things to prepare it would be obviously some upper body stretching 
DKOzSnHwSFI_10 it 's going to be how much fun you had just won't be able to wait till you get back up and do it again 
DKOzSnHwSFI_2 upper body at an abdominal exercises 
DKOzSnHwSFI_3 that always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sorry 
DKOzSnHwSFI_4 probably use muscles that you you haven't used before but with that soreness will come and a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun 
DKOzSnHwSFI_5 and having out being out on the mountain and just you won't be able to wait to get back up and ski again 
DKOzSnHwSFI_6 but again the more and more you could prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be 
DKOzSnHwSFI_7 some of the muscles that you'll use would be i wish you your forearms your biceps your lattes your back 
DKOzSnHwSFI_8 it will be a number of things that you will find muscles that you didn't forgot you even had but those are really the upper bodies is doing an awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work 
DKOzSnHwSFI_9 so but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles 
DM2CyN6AA9g_0 the line up for flashing wind to floss 
DM2CyN6AA9g_1 people will vary and when they'd like to do it 
DM2CyN6AA9g_2 most of the time what will find is that you'll flossed first then you'll do your tooth brushing then you'll do your tongue deep clacking and then rinsing after that 
DM2CyN6AA9g_3 so when you're setting up for your hygiene sessions but you want to do is you'll get everything out 
DM2CyN6AA9g_4 get your fla sound as well 
DM2CyN6AA9g_5 and you want to begin by preparing your floss for the actual procedure 
DM2CyN6AA9g_6 again usually what we have there is that you'll take about anywhere between twelve and eighteen inch piece of loss and if you are able to floss manually that is all you would need 
DM2CyN6AA9g_7 if you find that you're a person who needs to have a floss aid that should be at your disposal at that time as well as their rings that can be aiding in that circumstance where whereby the rings will save and spare your fingers from turning blue and from being too tight 
DM2CyN6AA9g_8 so you'll get whatever age you have available to help you with this flaw sing at that time 
DM2CyN6AA9g_9 at this point what we'll do as well prepared to do the actual lacing manually 
Da0LjheLUp0_0 i am danny biking from laughing dog farm 
Da0LjheLUp0_1 today i'm going to talk to you a little bit about mixing soil 
Da0LjheLUp0_10 something to give a body that the plants can grow and send their routine 
Da0LjheLUp0_2 to produce large numbers of beautiful food seedlings early in the season we need some good soil 
Da0LjheLUp0_3 and there's a lot to the science of soil but you might know that it's also an art as much as a science 
Da0LjheLUp0_4 so we're going to be mixing various ingredients into this wheelbarrow to come up with the most rich potting soil that we can to give these valuable heirloom vegetable seedlings extremely fast and robust start 
Da0LjheLUp0_5 so what do we need to know about mixing soil 
Da0LjheLUp0_6 well essentially soil is made of clay silt and sand three different sized particles 
Da0LjheLUp0_7 depending on the combination of the clay silt and sand in your soil you're going to have a soil in well drained are not so well drained or downright waterlogged 
Da0LjheLUp0_8 good soil is a combination of of particle sizes so you have your say and you have your silt you have your clay and then you have organic matter 
Da0LjheLUp0_9 when we make soil we're going to want to bring into the equation organic matter nutrients in the form of manure compost and then something to bulk it up 
DdzxfgB4W2c_0 
DdzxfgB4W2c_1 fish has been in the oven for about twenty minutes so now it's time to take it out 
DdzxfgB4W2c_10 this is where you can take our knife and the broccoli and just cut the ends off of our fleurette like 
DdzxfgB4W2c_11 so just enough for two people is what we need 
DdzxfgB4W2c_12 do and if you if you have more than two people you're welcome to save the steps and ethan turf 
DdzxfgB4W2c_13 i happened to prefer just the broccoli 
DdzxfgB4W2c_14 threats and to this regard to go to the sink so we can put an end 
DdzxfgB4W2c_15 water we just need a little bit of water here the bump just a little bit 
DdzxfgB4W2c_16 while and i'm going to put the broccoli florets in here 
DdzxfgB4W2c_17 so i'm going to cover them and then i'm going to put them on this note here we go 
DdzxfgB4W2c_18 with high heat so just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming so it's not going to be overcoats that's great 
DdzxfgB4W2c_19 screen and i'm going to check them every once in a while but it takes about 
DdzxfgB4W2c_2 we can see the growth is still there and here's our fish packet 
DdzxfgB4W2c_20 seven minutes to cook so keep clicking get close 
DdzxfgB4W2c_3 
DdzxfgB4W2c_4 but garlic still needs to cook 
DdzxfgB4W2c_5 every time 
DdzxfgB4W2c_6 and we're just going to let 's sit here and what i like to call residual cooking 
DdzxfgB4W2c_7 by all means do that when you take them out of the heat the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat 
DdzxfgB4W2c_8 it's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture soft texture 
DdzxfgB4W2c_9 meanwhile let's just quickly do our broccoli 
DfnHNkTE7mE_0 i got my first job back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four on a tv series called miami vice 
DfnHNkTE7mE_1 they were down in miami filming locally of course where the series was shot 
DfnHNkTE7mE_10 i think i was a little bit thinner lot better than and i had really high cheekbones and because of the way i look somehow ahead or a russian look to me 
DfnHNkTE7mE_11_12 the director who have eddie all most who played captain castillo on the series he saw my face mr strong face great balance 
DfnHNkTE7mE_13 crushing them 
DfnHNkTE7mE_14 put him in that in a suit so to speak 
DfnHNkTE7mE_15 so i was an ex kgb guy running around trying to kill crockett dub to the machine gun for most of the most of the show 
DfnHNkTE7mE_16 i think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with the real high quality project 
DfnHNkTE7mE_17 i did monster we shall east around in two thousand and four 
DfnHNkTE7mE_18 and it was a little independent movie 
DfnHNkTE7mE_19 it was actually lower than the screen actors guild standard and we all get a low budget pay for it 
DfnHNkTE7mE_2 call came out to all the actors aspiring actors in the area that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and we're comfortable in front of a camera to work on a tv show called miami vice 
DfnHNkTE7mE_20 but that's a great thing about this business you never know where or how the project you taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated generalist some films do 
DfnHNkTE7mE_21 for her get her an academy awards 
DfnHNkTE7mE_22 so i was in a scene we shall east around and monster 
DfnHNkTE7mE_23 during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that i think it was either the screen actors guild award show which was telecast on tnt or something i think turner's broadcasting showed that she mention my name 
DfnHNkTE7mE_24 for me 
DfnHNkTE7mE_25 daily works one night with 
DfnHNkTE7mE_26 we had a long scene to do 
DfnHNkTE7mE_27 i remember being very cold and i was very bloody and in my underwear which makes you wonder why i'm gonna go back and read that now 
DfnHNkTE7mE_28 so yeah do that go rennet because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me out appreciated 
DfnHNkTE7mE_29 some current the movie and check out the same 
DfnHNkTE7mE_3 so i went in not knowing what to expect really 
DfnHNkTE7mE_4 this is my first introduction to it and i got side 
DfnHNkTE7mE_5 when i was told to memorize the sides or look at them and then come back in and i'm going to put you on camera doing this 
DfnHNkTE7mE_6 so i did that and they like me 
DfnHNkTE7mE_7 i got hired as an actor on miami vice 
DfnHNkTE7mE_8 and it was my first job 
DfnHNkTE7mE_9 i was playing a russian kgb agent 
DwlVtUKfv3s_0 you 're getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it 's important that you are moving side to side and then bouncing balls of your feet 
DwlVtUKfv3s_1 you should never just stay put 
DwlVtUKfv3s_2 b movie because that's going to give you the energy to get the ball now 
DwlVtUKfv3s_3 wish they'd have your knees bent your feet spread out will be side to side 
DwlVtUKfv3s_4 you're actually be even go so that you are right 
DwlVtUKfv3s_5 particularly badly in order to get up to go get the ball 
DwlVtUKfv3s_6 so when it's working right you're going to have your feet moving and all the train your your hands and your racket moving inside decide your shoulders your eyes following the ball 
DyehHuc_Whk_0 everybody so let me share with you some other ideas that you can use in a complete routine 
DyehHuc_Whk_1 i did a lot of them with you 
DyehHuc_Whk_10 don 't be afraid to combine a bunch of stuff i've showed you and you some of your own ideas as well to create a foreign routine that you can do for your friends and family 
DyehHuc_Whk_11 have fun with a svengali deck 
DyehHuc_Whk_2 if any of the tricks that we've talked about any of the principles that we've talked about with a svengali deck you can certainly use in a routine 
DyehHuc_Whk_3 put something together that you think is entertaining 
DyehHuc_Whk_4 one thing i did want to talk about is 
DyehHuc_Whk_5 if you're going to do this this is kind of interesting what you want to do is get a queen of clubs that's normal 
DyehHuc_Whk_6 we want to stick it on top of your deck and then you want to have them pick a card like this and then you're going to pull a normal queen of clubs right off the top of the deck ok because you don't want to use one of your own one of your cut short cards for this 
DyehHuc_Whk_7 then you could tear this up and make it vanish using any of the methods we talked about in some of the other card videos and you could produce another one from your pocket 
DyehHuc_Whk_8 another idea you could use 
DyehHuc_Whk_9 you could do this whole routine that we talked about with all the cards looking the same and everything and then have a prediction sealed envelope 
E1prpF9WgrE_0 my name is abbey jones and we are talking about moving into a new space and how to make that process easy and efficient 
E1prpF9WgrE_1 so right now specifically we're talking about how to arrange furniture in your living space 
E1prpF9WgrE_10 the pillows because i have a small space i'm actually going to put them over to one side of my shelves as storage but i can pull them out when guests come over and when i want to to put them on the floor next to my coffee table so people can sit on them 
E1prpF9WgrE_11 something i like to think about what i'm placing chairs although i won't have any in this particular living space is creating a kind of conversation group areas so think about your house 
E1prpF9WgrE_12 if you had three people come over to your house or for people and how could they all sit so that nobody felt like they were on the other side of the universe or or your living room as it may be 
E1prpF9WgrE_13 and how you can create small intimate spaces within your larger space 
E1prpF9WgrE_2 so other than your couch and coffee table and shelves which are pieces that a lot of people have either miscellaneous pieces of furniture that that will vary from household the household 
E1prpF9WgrE_3 some of the miscellaneous pieces of furniture that i have our this and this stool that goes along with my couch a footstool kind of thing 
E1prpF9WgrE_4 and these big pillows that i like to use to to sit on that i put out when guests come over and that kind of thing 
E1prpF9WgrE_5 pieces of furniture that people might have are additional chairs side tables tv 
E1prpF9WgrE_6 cable these kinds of things 
E1prpF9WgrE_7 so things to think about when you're placing this furniture is just act and things that i like to think about are and how to create an intimate and harmonious spaces 
E1prpF9WgrE_8 so for instance what i'm going to do with this with my with this footstool is since i don't have that much room in my living space and the central living space 
E1prpF9WgrE_9 i'm actually going to put it behind my couch and so this over here and that will help and i guess fall under the category of creating a rooney space because it's not going to be just sitting on the middle of somewhere 
EJmna7hpk4M_1 another important aspect of the prerequisites check our control surfaces 
EJmna7hpk4M_10 one on each wing 
EJmna7hpk4M_11 we want to check and also for freedom of movement 
EJmna7hpk4M_12 in this case we want to make sure that when one goes up the other one goes down 
EJmna7hpk4M_13 on the underside of the aileron we also want to check the three hinge points to make sure that all the bolts are secure and that the hinge pins are also in place insecure 
EJmna7hpk4M_14 and outside for the 
EJmna7hpk4M_2 we want to check just like with the other structural stuff we want to check and make sure that all the rivets and all the are in good shape and cracks or any damage there 
EJmna7hpk4M_3 when you check for freedom of movement so we want to be able to move this 
EJmna7hpk4M_4 binding sounds nothing of that nature 
EJmna7hpk4M_5 we just want to check in the cockpit while we're doing this and make sure that they control yolk is moving the proper way 
EJmna7hpk4M_6 here we also want to check the trim tab this is an integral part of our elevator 
EJmna7hpk4M_7 and make sure that that experiment movement as well 
EJmna7hpk4M_8 we also want to check the rudder control surfaces well and make sure that we have some movement hair no binding and make sure there's no damage to the skin or the rivets here as well 
EJmna7hpk4M_9 we went to check our ailerons 
EMcUlzfIkwc_0 applause 
EMcUlzfIkwc_10 we get them all going the same way that our work 
EMcUlzfIkwc_11 go against the way he kept before 
EMcUlzfIkwc_12 skipton together 
EMcUlzfIkwc_13 and if you want to pivot your edge of your knife on one side and fan out hope as well 
EMcUlzfIkwc_14 and then find a new pivot point because their wages not cutting the exact same thing 
EMcUlzfIkwc_15 when you want your pieces enough about that big 
EMcUlzfIkwc_2 right now we're going to talk about chopping of our onion for our garlic committed 
EMcUlzfIkwc_3 need about a quarter cup of onion 
EMcUlzfIkwc_4 which were due credit and really thin slices 
EMcUlzfIkwc_5 we're gonna mints this 
EMcUlzfIkwc_6 they signed 
EMcUlzfIkwc_7 whatever the sun 
EMcUlzfIkwc_8 and as you can see the pieces are pretty thin 
EMcUlzfIkwc_9 help for the missing part 
EOfDkxQENkc_0 today i'm going to be corn rowing my baby sister's hair

EQWFrWeRVjQ_14 and then this is the boom and then this is the head 
EQWFrWeRVjQ_15 will loosen go ahead loosened both of those and get the head to where you think it's close enough to an angle of good angle and then the boom and titan 
EQWFrWeRVjQ_16 the tickets were just eyeballing

ETOZLBScxWY_0 this is john stewart and this is and repair tips for your team 
ETOZLBScxWY_1 first thing you're going to run into were repairing a lonely get small holes rips and your team the mash in other parts of the tent 
ETOZLBScxWY_10 this will get you through a camping trip but you probably want to replace your poll after that 
ETOZLBScxWY_11 the poles bungie breaks on the inside the pole will still go together it's just she had to put it together piece by piece instead of just having it snap together 
ETOZLBScxWY_12 the rain flab against leak or your tent against a week you need to take and replace the same sailing on it 
ETOZLBScxWY_13 just by to the same sealer runner and across the seams and a waterproof your seems to where you don't have any leaks or drains into your team 
ETOZLBScxWY_14 yeah punctures in your ground flaw probably ought to replace the ground flax this is the main protector from the bomb your teen so you don't want to have any punctures or anything like that and graham flop 
ETOZLBScxWY_15 and this is how to some repair tips for setting up your team 
ETOZLBScxWY_2 the easiest way to repair the duct tape 
ETOZLBScxWY_3 we can put a piece of duct tape on the inside of the rip and on the outside of the rip and just sandwiched together 
ETOZLBScxWY_4 this stuff will hold up during your camping trip but you do want to get a further repair once you get back 
ETOZLBScxWY_5 other things you might run into is a broken pole 
ETOZLBScxWY_6 polls will tend to crack once they get back into phonic he shapes that she might put them into 
ETOZLBScxWY_7 when you do encounter this is the crack as small once again put some duct tape over it and this will keep it from expanding and that getting bigger 
ETOZLBScxWY_8 if you break a pole and half you can repair this by having an extra feral or a poll protector 
ETOZLBScxWY_9 another way to do this is to take to really hard sticks duct tape them on their together 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_0 i am aren't going to be discussing how to add natural highlights at home 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_1 if you do not feel as if you the right to go to a salon just want to add your change color up a little bit and a little bit more dimension you can go to any drugstore or any beauty destination and get a hair home lightning kit 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_10 very gently and weigh them down 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_11 so that maybe they're not even directory touching that hair that's underneath 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_12 it prevents any spot in any errors that could occur 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_13 so you're going to put it down very gently just kind of release it 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_14 we can do that all throughout the head so that way you can whitening as many sections as you want 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_15 one nice things that this is a bit more placed so you can kind of say i'd like a highlight here and then you can actually put that highlight their 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_16 if you do have wider hair color more of ikea very light brown or your dark lined the home haircut hair lightning systems may work out better for you 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_17 if your hair is very dark you may just want to go to your vote or salon because they are whisked action tends to not be as strong as what are professional can get and what will happen is that a leave your highlights looking very brassy very very orange in very very bright 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_18 i tend to find that people with a wider based color have a bit of an easier time and better results in doing home hair lighting kits 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_19 and that is how to whiten your hair 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_2 ultimately he will mix up whatever the hertz leitner is that they give you 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_3 will come as a good bit of a brush ships such as this or it may have a little bit more harder bristle in this one actually does 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_4 we will then simply mix up everything that they give you and they follow the directions that they give you 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_5 he would paint it on your hair 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_6 the best way to do that is to dip your brush in and then literally stroke and answers tiny sections that you would like to be a writer 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_7_8 weigh them gently over the rest of the hair and then let them go you would do this with each section 
Eh2AVkAQsxI_9 we do not want to push them down because what happened is that or start to whiten those hairs underneath and cause you to have spots 
EhYk6e-jtWg_0 to drink we are about to make is a claridge cocktail

EjzQn4ReeeI_0 all right in this clip will be doing the upper body on our acute more cartoon ized angel and we're just going to give him a simple white robe 
EjzQn4ReeeI_1 for an extent by drawing his neck and they're like that may be given a v neck shape to israel there 
EjzQn4ReeeI_10 at the top of his robe sleeves little belt there his hands and that will work well for his upper body 
EjzQn4ReeeI_11 and in the next clip will move on to the lower half of his body 
EjzQn4ReeeI_2 the top edges of 
EjzQn4ReeeI_3 it was going to come down and do his shoulders like that 
EjzQn4ReeeI_4 dance troupe down and give him some flowing robes here 
EjzQn4ReeeI_5 we're going to draw the sleeves coming into his side like that and as you draw his robe coming down to his boat would be can give it a little bit of outward curves so that when you come in and draws belt like that and a little bit of a realistic little space where the fabric would kind of bend in there like that like that 
EjzQn4ReeeI_6 little swooping detail to the road like that and men charles hands in there

EmNBzTLRz-E_0 exercise is what i call it advanced level lunge because the back leg is gonna stay straight 
EmNBzTLRz-E_1 in our regular lunge muesli bend the back knee 
EmNBzTLRz-E_10 i'm going to go into that forward advanced level land where the back like a straight do a reverse lie and come up 
EmNBzTLRz-E_11 again my challenge comes from this forward foot being on the unstable surface forward 
EmNBzTLRz-E_12 and one more safety point for you we never want the spine rounded 
EmNBzTLRz-E_13 when it lifted chest open and reverse fly 
EmNBzTLRz-E_2 in this exercise the backlog is going to say straight while the body moves forward over the forward quadriceps 
EmNBzTLRz-E_3 do this onto the boasts eu and incorporate again and upper body exercise along with it 
EmNBzTLRz-E_4 like to do a lot of back work because typically are interiors tight and are backus stretch so it's nice to have muscle balance and do a lot of backward 
EmNBzTLRz-E_5 so they advanced level land where stamp on the toe on the back keep the hill off the floor keep the legs straight the knees slightly soft lunged forward and then come straight 
EmNBzTLRz-E_6 so as a lunge my nice thing over the center of my foot 
EmNBzTLRz-E_7 if your knee goes past your toe than just scoots your back leg forward or backward back a little bit i'm going to incorporate a row 
EmNBzTLRz-E_8 when a lunge row and come up lunch

Enhria4v_jo_0 by judy carrier with jewels by park lane and i want to tell you how to clean your sterling silver jewelry 
Enhria4v_jo_1 first volley foot a pot of water on to boil just like you would if you're having a baby in the old movies 
Enhria4v_jo_10 pour the water off when it's quit fizzing and take it out rents it and pat it dry with a lint free cloth and your choice should look as good as new 
Enhria4v_jo_11 and judy carrier with jewels by park lane and that's how you clean sterling silver jewelry 
Enhria4v_jo_2 he had a glass pot or a an aluminum pammy than one will work 
Enhria4v_jo_3 if you have a glass potter something just thought of line it with aluminum foil just plain aluminum foil that you use on the turkey 
Enhria4v_jo_4 then take some baking soda and sprinkled liberally over the hump the foil 
Enhria4v_jo_5 but your jewelry and there 
Enhria4v_jo_6 set it in and then you pour the hot water over 
Enhria4v_jo_7 it 's gonna fears up smells like rotten eggs it's not the nicest smelling 
Enhria4v_jo_8 we let it sit there while until it's completely dissolve and you might want to shake the panel little or just start to make sure that the baking powder is completely dissolved 
Enhria4v_jo_9 and while that is claiming you may want to figure out the windows or something that opened a window get that smell out 
FMSiqrDXABU_0 right now we're going to talk about laying out the job 
FMSiqrDXABU_1 what are you going to want to do is go and measure where the fence is going to to be and make yourself a hand drawn diagram 
FMSiqrDXABU_2 we've measured out a yard and determine that we're going to have a certain footage on this side along the back the other side and drawn it out how we want it to allow the fence and the gates 
FMSiqrDXABU_3 from this hand drawn diagram you can then come up with a custom lay out did depending on what spacing you want to set your posts 
FMSiqrDXABU_4 we 've got a custom lay out here that goes right along with that hand drawn diet diagram 
FMSiqrDXABU_5 we've taken a seventy seven inch center dissenter spacing which is a seventy two inch opening between posts and figured out what each side how many sections would be on each side determining which posts will be required and how many of each kind of post 
FMSiqrDXABU_6 with this diagram you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground 
FS0f1ytiWGE_0 what michael britain films that org located in salt lake city utah when we're talking about using microsoft windows 
FS0f1ytiWGE_1 i want to talk to you about how to save a file with a different name 
FS0f1ytiWGE_10 save this document 
FS0f1ytiWGE_11 we say it's let's just go ahead and save as and we're going to choose it to go to our desktop 
FS0f1ytiWGE_12 it automatically chooses the first couple of letters of our of our text so what we're going to do this we're going to go ahead and change this to test document and then we're in a scroll of here to save and it's going to say to the desktop 
FS0f1ytiWGE_13 and as you can see up in the upper left hand corner or document now is called test document microsoft word 
FS0f1ytiWGE_14 glenn close out of this document 
FS0f1ytiWGE_15 and as you can see over here in our desktop we've created a file called test document 
FS0f1ytiWGE_16 what i'm going to do is i'm going to double click on this and reopened as because while we want to do as let's say a couple months have gone by in our test document whatever he typed and that was really important but we need to make some changes but even though we make the changes we still want to keep the original file 
FS0f1ytiWGE_17 what we're going to do so we're going to open our original file and then let's say we want to make some changes by may be dropping some of these texts down maybe want to add some text here he would want to add in some numbers or something 
FS0f1ytiWGE_18 what we're gonna do as with when we got to file we don't want to click save because what that's going to do is over right our existing test document that erasing what we've had originally 
FS0f1ytiWGE_19 so if we want to keep the original and save this is a new separate file we're going to want to go to save as again 
FS0f1ytiWGE_2 this is very helpful 
FS0f1ytiWGE_20 this time when it comes up it's going to bring it up as the old named has taken me 
FS0f1ytiWGE_21 we do not want to click save just yet 
FS0f1ytiWGE_22 let 's say we want to add in test argument to so that we have a part to actually better yet let's write poetry test argument part two 
FS0f1ytiWGE_23 and now we can either hit enter or left click with their mouse on save 
FS0f1ytiWGE_24 we've chosen a statement to the desktop 
FS0f1ytiWGE_25 now saves if you look in the upper left hand corner as test document part two 
FS0f1ytiWGE_26 closes document and we see that on our desktop we have now created we now to documents created 
FS0f1ytiWGE_27 we have test argument and test document part two 
FS0f1ytiWGE_28 that 's how you successfully save the file with a different name thus organizing your desktop or your computer a lot better 
FS0f1ytiWGE_3 for example if you create a file in a word or excel and then you decide you want to change the name or like let's say for example you're creating a spreadsheet for your budget for the month of january and then come the next month you want to use the same spreadsheet but it's for the month of february and you want to separate 
FS0f1ytiWGE_4 warner re save over the january once you're going to want to relay will that february and save it to the same location or another location and so i'm going to show you how to do that 
FS0f1ytiWGE_5 let me start by saying that windows xp as a registered trademark of microsoft and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft 
FS0f1ytiWGE_6 to save a file with a different name is very important because you might want to reuse some of the same files and eventually changed the name so they don't really save over the yield file so that you still have the old file 
FS0f1ytiWGE_7 i've gone ahead and opened a word document here called document one 
FS0f1ytiWGE_8 set as the default name for any word document when i opened it up 
FS0f1ytiWGE_9 we 're gonna go ahead and just type in a bunch of jargon here 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_0 did you know that vista can actually use more than one processor 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_1 dan afonso of unfold i t and afonso consulting and this is how to set vista processor affinity 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_10 the two processor machine starting at zero suddenly felt no you can only one on one hit ok 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_11 boom 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_12 you shouldn't need to do this very often 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_13 really it's only going to happen if you're doing a lot of video editing sound processing or anything it requires a lot of processor time and it should be used with caution because it can wind up annoying or just otherwise making programs run kind of funny but used properly it will make your experience a little bit better and make this a little bit more tolerable 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_14 dan afonso and that was how to set processor finnerty on vista 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_2 processor affinity is a fancy way of saying you can allocate which processors run for which applications 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_3 now you want to do this if you have an application that uses a lot of resources and you really don't want running on all your processors taking up all their time or if you want to split up your processes across sea views in a bit more of an organized fashion rather than when vista do it itself 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_4 it 's not a very common thing but if you're burning a dvd if you're making videos if you're doing anything requires a lot of processor time and still on your machine to be usable 's a really good thing too 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_5 so organ do is i'm just going to bring up the task manager by right clicking on the taskbar clicking on task manager 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_6 over here we're going to see a lot of programs under the processes can find the one you want 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_7 just grab one of them campsie sure i'm going to set the affinity 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_8 now it's going to come up with what can they set up to 
Fr0hSHhEpzY_9 said the cps zero seeping you want 
_2FBDaOPYig_1 so today i'm going to be showing you how to a gourmet french fries cooked in duck fat 
_2FBDaOPYig_10 but like i said be really really careful 
_2FBDaOPYig_11 but it's already popped on me twice really really big 
_2FBDaOPYig_12 by two foot high oil explosions so just be really careful makes you don't bring your house down machine and burn yourself 
_2FBDaOPYig_2 so we're currently heating up the oil at this point you're gonna want to be very very careful unless you render the duck fat yourself 
_2FBDaOPYig_3 i bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat 
_2FBDaOPYig_4 so what's happening as you'll see all the bubbles on top right there 
_2FBDaOPYig_5 the moisture that's the water actually coming out of the oil and which means it was probably improperly stored at the store or was allowed to partially thorn in the refrigerator 
_2FBDaOPYig_6 let 's go until they don't see any bubbles in there 
_2FBDaOPYig_7 i do have it a little hotter than usual 
_2FBDaOPYig_8 but three fifty right now i want to get to three hundred 
_2FBDaOPYig_9 five so i was going to turn the heat down a little bit back off some while only from these bubbles to come out 
_5CV2fIG7qY_2 are saying you want to do is make sure you get your very good quality a piece of equipment 
_5CV2fIG7qY_3 well we're very fortunate boateng named it after me that color to general 
_5CV2fIG7qY_4 and it's an incredible ball i'm really impressed with a way above shoot it 's an amazing product 
_5CV2fIG7qY_5 this is a little device i found it makes it easier to keep in a blind and make it stand to there's got to make sure you have a good good stabilizer on 
_5CV2fIG7qY_6 this little wrestling and gives you comfort when you're holding a bow 
_5CV2fIG7qY_7 a different side she says a lot each site you can turn on the lights dim on it 
_5CV2fIG7qY_8 is a camp system with a fall away risk 
_5CV2fIG7qY_9 i like a lot of people don't do the rope on the on the bow or the rubber deal on it but i always want to make sure that this is back in line to perfect every time and hunting situation as primary will not do attorney 
_64bCfimlk8_6 actually how to play the game there is another element called speeding it up will take a look at that in the next clip 
_7uBzSGPQis_1 take your shoulders right back 
_7uBzSGPQis_10 index to bring your chin murdered and torture chess and held a tough tall and xl bring your chain torture chess 
_7uBzSGPQis_2 we start off by opening the sternum centered party a chest mountain positive feelings in the body 
_7uBzSGPQis_3 shoulders go right back 
_7uBzSGPQis_4 beyond just hanging down and relax so they can touch it dies 
_7uBzSGPQis_5 chin go up and said chen goes up towards a seal and the thyroid is exposed 
_7uBzSGPQis_6 here are the chest opens up for shock or in a toe disappears shot 
_7uBzSGPQis_7 take a deep breath and 
_7uBzSGPQis_8 on the axial keeping your shoulders back on the chin come in toward your chest 
_7uBzSGPQis_9 besides thyroid any real live turn up tall 
_b1ZDanAjuA_0 foot placement required for switchboard slide is very similar to this the foot placement for the regular force line just picture everything backwards the only difference is going to be is that imagine you're getting into a switch front side when eighty because the foot position needed is very similar to that 
_b1ZDanAjuA_1 what you're going to do is hang the tip of your towel over the board or the tip of your heel and just a big toe 
_b1ZDanAjuA_2 the reason for this is that you need to get a ninety degree switch on and this is going to help you push the board in that direction 
_b1ZDanAjuA_3 another foot as to be right behind the trunks and the reason for this is so that when you get into the switchboard slide it ends up being about right here that's the only way you're going to be able to get out of the board slide because if you have your foot on the tail so that you could put the wait to get out of the switchboard slide 
_b1ZDanAjuA_4 so remember similar to a switch front side when eighty and imagine with any switch trick it's like turning it around and doing it the other way so if you already know how to do a board slynn just imagine a mirror image of the foot placement that's needed and you can imagine how it will be for the foot placement switchboard slide 
a1HVL0zE768_2 then from to the us and standing on your left leg bend the right knee

a4Nxq0QV_WA_8 disposition he stopped me 
a4Nxq0QV_WA_9 
a4uz0W33REs_0 
a4uz0W33REs_1 
a4uz0W33REs_10 
a4uz0W33REs_11 
a4uz0W33REs_2

a5yNwUSiYpA_0_1 i'm going to be performing here is called a front squad now that traditional squat usually see the bar behind the neck 
a5yNwUSiYpA_10 keep your body steady throughout the whole flow 
a5yNwUSiYpA_11 about depending on the amount of what you're doing to go we will have you want to do about eight to ten reps 
a5yNwUSiYpA_12 going through a light you want to do about ten to thirteen 
a5yNwUSiYpA_13 again the first why they're going to cost a lot on the front part next to the niqab to help develop those better 
a5yNwUSiYpA_14 and that's how you perform the from school 
a5yNwUSiYpA_2 this is in front of your body 
a5yNwUSiYpA_3 is going to be laying on your shoulders 
a5yNwUSiYpA_4 cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold 
a5yNwUSiYpA_5 now the first develops your kids 
a5yNwUSiYpA_6 what we call it at the gym 
a5yNwUSiYpA_7 which is the front part of your claws that's neither kneecap 
a5yNwUSiYpA_8 we want to go down with the bar come up 
a5yNwUSiYpA_9 again just like the squat and when a push from the heels 
aUBqWgdXamE_1 we 've pretty much fixed or leaky little problem here 
aUBqWgdXamE_2 so what we did was we took this all housing off and we replace nor our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one 
aUBqWgdXamE_3 i think we've probably solve their problems 
aUBqWgdXamE_4 at this point there's going to be no more leaks in the shower 
aUBqWgdXamE_5 again this is something that you can do at home 
aUBqWgdXamE_6 it's really not that hard if you know the tricks that's it for me today 
abzRFn8xngA_1 normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing is i would write out a petition 
abzRFn8xngA_2 that would be almost like a prayer saying what i intend to do and for whom i intend to do it 
abzRFn8xngA_3 then i sometimes use a pop it as i had mentioned before and i would wrap herbs around it 
abzRFn8xngA_4 for if say they had a broken leg i would concentrate the healing on the lake part 
abzRFn8xngA_5 sometimes what i do is i'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face so that it actually looks like the person 
abzRFn8xngA_6 and that's called sympathetic magic 
abzRFn8xngA_7 where i'm not actually doing the magic on somebody but i'm doing it on some thing instead 
abzRFn8xngA_8 then i would place it on the pentecostal i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person 
abzRFn8xngA_9 and of course for the highest good of all and that it harm none 
afDfb8xx09w_0 now i've been talking about the direction of the ball 
afDfb8xx09w_1 basically you have to directions that women are we talking about 
afDfb8xx09w_7 for four hundred underline the same concept you're going to be 
afDfb8xx09w_8 we 're gonna hit it just a little more behind 
ahJr2i50Qew_0 one thing as you notice we don't have any three point last year but that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during sometime during that period of three point line 
ahJr2i50Qew_1 with three point line is actually i talked about it earlier in one thousand nine point nine for college and high school and actually an mba at the nba lies a little further out twenty three now twenty three feet knowledge 
ahJr2i50Qew_10 so saying shooting mccain is a black and there you have it shooting the three push 
ahJr2i50Qew_2 so whenever you shouldn't same suit and mechanics 
ahJr2i50Qew_3 we want to take you take your three point shot 
ahJr2i50Qew_4 i'm going to show you i'm going to take actually go across court here to show you exactly roundabout with three point shot would be being is how we don't have actually have a three point line or rna court 
ahJr2i50Qew_5 so check me out 
ahJr2i50Qew_6 coming over here in the shooting the three point shot same shooting mechanics applies irregular shock no changes you just might down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot unless you're strong enough to actually get it would etc 
ahJr2i50Qew_7 so you'd taken taking your three point shot you want to make sure if you're playing outside outdoors you gotta laugh for the weird that's the thing about plant outside 
ahJr2i50Qew_8 always gotten a lot for them 
ahJr2i50Qew_9 if you're taken as a little more distance so you shoot with three points shock to allow for the wind and just like that you take this app 
angHQkCxQAc_1 it 's important to maintain even tile courses on each side of a gabled roof wherever possible when using barrel trims 
angHQkCxQAc_10 in this instance a tapered plywood filler is added 
angHQkCxQAc_11 finland behind the first baton to allow the flat roofing membrane to form up and over the first baton without creating a water trap 
angHQkCxQAc_2 even length trims cut at the peak create a visual problems 
angHQkCxQAc_3 it is of equal importance to have a uniform title courses starting on each side of a hog valley where possible and practical 
angHQkCxQAc_4 fans are installed five inches apart centered on the valley 
angHQkCxQAc_5 but in space or position sideways ensures that this space 
angHQkCxQAc_6 as the valley flashing is a gutter that sits down in the bat and you should for in the valleys first otherwise you will have to cut out eve berlin's to install the valley gutter 
angHQkCxQAc_7 valley transitions onto a roof you should end the valley framing just short of the law retail coursing 
angHQkCxQAc_8 personal assistant transitioning into valley metal onto the lower tile 
angHQkCxQAc_9 valley should be re pitched to allow for adequate slope 
aoJDJktJkzw_0 ok so or kimchi is pretty much all mixed up now and when you're doing this at home you could really set this aside can let it was the tickling process happen for a good solid half an hour to a tower and you can see now already the difference in the texture of the kimchi 
aoJDJktJkzw_1 with cucumbers not stiff anymore i mean it'll still break and when you eat it has a nice crunch too 
aoJDJktJkzw_2 so once it's re all we introduce revisit our race which is now done in the rice cooker 
aoJDJktJkzw_3 spoon some of it out wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi 
aoJDJktJkzw_4 and you can do it over the rice you can go wrong side of the rice you can do it however you like canned if you're really ambitious when you went to the asian market and got yourself some kimchi traditional country 
aoJDJktJkzw_5 put that into and there you have your basic korean male vegetarian 
at8bAQq9jZY_1 one of the ways that i continued to create my sound is i use what's called a loop station 
at8bAQq9jZY_2 in a loop station is basically live recording that's an exile our input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have that goes into the loop station in what you do is you press basically a pedal and it starts to record 
at8bAQq9jZY_3 when you press the pedal again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience and in doing so you can create mean sound with a lot of stuff layered over top of it 
at8bAQq9jZY_4 be very creative it's a very creative way to to show people what you're about to help facilitate really what your music is about creating a sound onstage 
at8bAQq9jZY_5 people really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to to broaden your musical horizons 
b-mHbL3d2ec_1 turn off a little of the roots section and peel off that outer brown skin ok now to chop an onion you want to leave that little bit of roots section on 
b-mHbL3d2ec_2 where and when you cut into the ung in you only cut in here you start that you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole falls apart if you can start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together see how the onion stays together 
b-mHbL3d2ec_3 and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cat i am and you can just at that point cut up the rest of the route section 
b-mHbL3d2ec_4 set them aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that peel it off by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vaporous you get to because you're not chop chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted and it's very quick to cut an onion like this 
b-mHbL3d2ec_5 just continue that with all your audience now i'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife flatly and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off 
b-mHbL3d2ec_6 another way to crush the garlic is to take a sturdy glass or a jar and just that little whack that also will crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off your skin a rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next will prep the leak

bBHYQCDp_9A_0 when you're running a press or some the deepest is running a press one thing that you want to learn how to do is break that press 
bBHYQCDp_9A_1 travis and i'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that when you're on on the basketball court 
bBHYQCDp_9A_10 once that is the key to breaking the press 
bBHYQCDp_9A_11 suppressed once a guard has the ball in the middle of the court the press is pretty much broken then then the thing is finding someone to pass it to and getting a downpour 
bBHYQCDp_9A_12 so try your best to get that person whoever is going to have the ball actors inbound to get into the middle of the court so that they have options on the right and on their left 
bBHYQCDp_9A_13 once that happens there you have it breaking the press 
bBHYQCDp_9A_2 a number one when there is a press or suppress what you want to make sure you do is when you have the guy in the person inbound the ball you want to make sure that they have options 
bBHYQCDp_9A_3 somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble because you don't want them out out of bounds for five seconds when they get into trouble they can find someone to pass it to 
bBHYQCDp_9A_4 unusually it'll be you'll have to god you'll have your point guard and you're shooting guard back here 
bBHYQCDp_9A_5 what they'll do for each other is they'll sit screens and when he or she smacks of all you had them split try to get oprah was the ball is inbound and they get the ball then that point guard let's shoot and god will take control of the game and look for their actions 
bBHYQCDp_9A_6 the two guards are back here you'll have you may have the sinner all the way back or you may have their sin or somewhere closer to the top of the key on the opposite top of the key 
bBHYQCDp_9A_7 but you also want to have your forwards around half court so that they have so that your guards have options if they get in trouble 
bBHYQCDp_9A_8 you want to make sure that you pass a half court line within within the timeframe the second time frame which you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly move because you break an oppressed as pressure is going to be pressure gets you that's what the press is 
bBHYQCDp_9A_9 so you want to have your office and players down the court constantly moving and constantly setting screened for each other so they can get open 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_0 in this clip we'd like to show you how to load your shotgun your pump action shotgun first 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_1 for most important part to loading your pump shotgun is always make sure that your safety is applied 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_10 yellow to pump action shotgun 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_2 in order to do that you always want to make sure that the red dot is showing or your safety is and safe position now 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_3 there are two different ways a load of pump pump action shotgun 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_4 first way would be to take the shotgun open the action put around in the chamber and close to slide down and 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_5 once you have the ground in the chamber at that point you could load the additional rounds in the magazine too 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_6 second way and i'm going to show you this alone more clearly if you take a closer look here is to take the rounds push down the loading gate right here and then take your shotgun shells and push him in 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_7 and here the spraying that i'm pushing against as my fingers and once 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_8 says loaded you cannot fit another shotgun shell in there 
bC_iD2Dwc1U_9 for magazine tube is completely loaded your again take the slide release pulled back and then load shotgun 
bHdXYjk977I_0 a textbook i'm talking about is on one to do a necklace and i'm going to make a turquoise tackles since i have lots of turquoise here to choose tramp 
bHdXYjk977I_1 and i'm going to use a top class which has a circle and i also has an piece here with a chain 
bHdXYjk977I_10 see what would look nice with the the necklace and i think that's one with but mine says a centerpiece 
bHdXYjk977I_11 it would look really good 
bHdXYjk977I_12 what will do as will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece 
bHdXYjk977I_13 first the brain 
bHdXYjk977I_14 will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace canada and this will be our design 
bHdXYjk977I_15 probably the beginning of it 
bHdXYjk977I_2 so i'm going to put the second mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace 
bHdXYjk977I_3 this is the type of many years 
bHdXYjk977I_4 scada flat disk 
bHdXYjk977I_5 also this type but i'm going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it's going to be sixteen inches 
bHdXYjk977I_6 most manufacturers when you buy your bees they come in sixteen and sleep 
bHdXYjk977I_7 because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice 
bHdXYjk977I_8 so i was going through my large beads hair and i was looking to see which one would match up nicely 
bHdXYjk977I_9 when looks a little too bland here 
bIUmw2DVW7Q_0 risk control the news from a slash and attack

bR_iEPaf6eU_1 this video is about learning how to play the didgeridoo and i'd like to share a few secrets with 
bR_iEPaf6eU_10 some people can do it for a couple of hours at a time 
bR_iEPaf6eU_11 start out with ten seconds thirty seconds a minute two minutes five minutes turn it into a game that your friends to buy one turn it into a competition and eventually play with multiple people 
bR_iEPaf6eU_2 and as with any instrument playing a didgeridoo requires practice 
bR_iEPaf6eU_3 yes practice makes perfect 
bR_iEPaf6eU_4 the more you play the better you're going to get and the more fun you're going to have 
bR_iEPaf6eU_5 be creative with 
bR_iEPaf6eU_6 and have a good time 
bR_iEPaf6eU_7 it's relaxing to play this thing 
bR_iEPaf6eU_8 when i come home after a hard day at the tv station i sit down in a closed room with my didgeridoo for about a half an hour 
bR_iEPaf6eU_9 i can sometimes when managers and plugged up circular brief for up to half an hour 
bUFsn9GQsCg_0 and have some very good news for you about feral cats 
bUFsn9GQsCg_1 in los angeles police department is now employ feral cats who otherwise would have been euthanized at shelters to fight rats and mice at two police station one the southeastern branch the other the central brands 
bUFsn9GQsCg_10 a very cute and of course people want to buy them their turkish and gore's 
bUFsn9GQsCg_11 and ideas that this research may actually lead to cures for human disease 
bUFsn9GQsCg_12 right now it's just a very cute idea 
bUFsn9GQsCg_13 i say that 
bUFsn9GQsCg_14 the 
bUFsn9GQsCg_2 and they report excellent success because once the rats and mice smelled the presence of the cats the fleet 
bUFsn9GQsCg_3 cats don't even have to chase them 
bUFsn9GQsCg_4 it said that it parker center downtown la their main center there are now going to enjoy having a feral cats drive out the rats there 
bUFsn9GQsCg_5 i think this should be carried out around the country 
bUFsn9GQsCg_6 wherever there's a rat problem whether it be police department or elsewhere because of feral cats do an excellent job and they otherwise i'm sorry to say would be youth 
bUFsn9GQsCg_7 from south korea we have another case of cancer it's very interesting 
bUFsn9GQsCg_8 and i've just clone glow in the dark kiddies 
bUFsn9GQsCg_9 yes they have given them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultra violet light 
bX0Zpf-rEgc_1 walk throughs and falling gene therapy 
bX0Zpf-rEgc_2 from a standpoint tonight with covered a lot information 
bX0Zpf-rEgc_3 basically about the stance we've talked about how to move the ball through the stans we've talked about release position we've talked about spare shooting we've talked about how to speed on the ball 
bX0Zpf-rEgc_4 it gives me a lot of empathy standpoint it's time to take information go out on the lanes to play with 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_0 there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_1 the first one that need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored or right 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_10 and those are some of the negatives that they are not in such great things about impromptu speaking just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_11 know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_2 and a lot of this has to do with structure which i'm going to talk about in a minute but you're thinking on your feet 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_3 you know the topic but you have to while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation you have to keep your audience interested 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_4 he can't ramble on you can't have random organizational patterns you have to keep the audience with you 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_5 so that's something that you run the risk of this is your audience not staying with you 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_6 obviously you're your goal your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well thought out speech 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_7 while you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought out speech you just met the topic 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_8 so you have to try and present a well thought out speech but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time 
bb1Z5dw4N-s_9 also one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details you haven't had time to research you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech so you're going to miss out on some of those details 
bbSKqkE4EBs_0 in this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of qi gong breathing 
bbSKqkE4EBs_1 the essence of archie going exercisers is in the exercise of the breath and although there is wonderful energetic reasons why we do that particular chico exercises we do i like to talk more about the western physiological reasons of why the belly breeding that we often times do is so beneficial 
bbSKqkE4EBs_10 will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing and we'll talk about in the next segment 
bbSKqkE4EBs_11 so remember barely breathe it's the way we're supposed to breed 
bbSKqkE4EBs_2 one of the main reasons it is the lymphatic system of our body 
bbSKqkE4EBs_3 the lymphatic system has to pumps 
bbSKqkE4EBs_4 when we get through exercise muscle contraction and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm the muscle that were supposed to use and respiration 
bbSKqkE4EBs_5 but don't shaped muscle that's here right underneath our lungs and the way we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up 
bbSKqkE4EBs_6 that action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of them fat lymphatic fluids of our body limping i hate to say it the book of our body or that the waste products of many of our body systems 
bbSKqkE4EBs_7 so one of the best ways we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing 
bbSKqkE4EBs_8 it has other benefits were in that it actually works towards helping regulate the ph of our blood which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis and so although the calcium and our bones as the primary way the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that 
bbSKqkE4EBs_9 so we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly 
bcNtUYh3GNs_0 veronica bass from broadcast coastline in baseball 
bcNtUYh3GNs_2 whenever lean back comfortable 
bcNtUYh3GNs_3 this is where we're going to use warm water 
bcNtUYh3GNs_4 born the warm not hot 
bcNtUYh3GNs_5 coal will really be rated sampler at the very end of an era when let's give it a go and they all the cubicles 
bcNtUYh3GNs_6 if people don't realize 
bcNtUYh3GNs_7 it 's going to be a little cold sad but it feels the critical period 
bcNtUYh3GNs_8 getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the ph balance them 
bcNtUYh3GNs_9 stop the total continuation of processing 
bjvIIdYWc-k_1 right now we're going to discuss choosing the right painful your project 
bjvIIdYWc-k_2 what i've got here my hand as a paint will 
bjvIIdYWc-k_3 it gives the different colors that independent stores will offer 
bjvIIdYWc-k_4 so you can have as great selection to choose from 
bjvIIdYWc-k_5 depending upon the application you're going to either want to get a flat an eggshell san blas so my class all that can be done regardless of your coat color choices 
bjvIIdYWc-k_6 personally i would put a glossary semi gloss on your doors and an eggshell or sat in on your walls 
bjvIIdYWc-k_7 it can use flat to go along your fillings or you can use a satin finish for that as well 
bjvIIdYWc-k_8 the reason for this from a different sheen's is to bring out the different colors the different textures and also durability and clean ability 
bjvIIdYWc-k_9 higher gloss paint is going to give you more of a clickable surface whereas a flat pain is not easily is clean 
bpOKSl0oIIw_1 we're going to be learning how to play portal again by our software 
bpOKSl0oIIw_10 sort of toxic view that you wouldn't want to find yourself in 
bpOKSl0oIIw_11 so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber eight at all costs 
bpOKSl0oIIw_12 but look over here on our left we've got a powerboat spencer and an orange portal and power conduit 
bpOKSl0oIIw_13 so what we need to do is find a way to get the powerball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit 
bpOKSl0oIIw_14 but we need to be careful because if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the powerball we will die 
bpOKSl0oIIw_15 so we need to find a different way of doing things 
bpOKSl0oIIw_2 company with which i have no affiliation 
bpOKSl0oIIw_3 all right 
bpOKSl0oIIw_4 we are and test chamber eight 
bpOKSl0oIIw_5 some new icons here now 
bpOKSl0oIIw_6 get the old familiar powerball death howard all our come to it and now it looks like we get some other ones 
bpOKSl0oIIw_7 the risk of drowning and don't drink the water 
bpOKSl0oIIw_8 so we look here and test chamber 
bpOKSl0oIIw_9 we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic do 
cDJuwtDYaSg_0 the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan 
cDJuwtDYaSg_1 there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan 
cDJuwtDYaSg_10 so anytime you want to spice up your guinness a little bit and you don't feel like haven't just a bass make yourself a black and tan mixture of both 
cDJuwtDYaSg_11 bottoms up 
cDJuwtDYaSg_2 but if you ask most people will tell you that it's guinness and bass ale 
cDJuwtDYaSg_3 first thing to do is going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your bass halfway 
cDJuwtDYaSg_4 are going to fill the rest of the way with guinness 
cDJuwtDYaSg_5 the guinness is darker 
cDJuwtDYaSg_6 we will see the difference between the top and the bottom 
cDJuwtDYaSg_7 we should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see 
cDJuwtDYaSg_8 atop should be a little bit darker than the bottom 
cDJuwtDYaSg_9 and that's a black and tan 
cHFW_U9e4sM_0 the next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially his inner courtyard or stomach forty four 
cHFW_U9e4sM_1 this one's really easy to find it's literally between the second and third toe 
cHFW_U9e4sM_2 so you're just going to rub in between the toes 
cHFW_U9e4sM_3 run your finger in their massage and between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain relaxing the muscles and dogs like t generally have their feet massaged by their owners they don't like i'm touched by the vets much quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything 
cHFW_U9e4sM_4 you can do a four foot massage on them if you like 
cHFW_U9e4sM_5 good acupressure points in between the other toes as well but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain and the back limbs 
cHFW_U9e4sM_6 if you want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this nice hurting is compensating by using this leg 
cHFW_U9e4sM_7 so you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs 
cHFW_U9e4sM_8 we want to work that point 
cHFW_U9e4sM_9 again that's as a massage just rubbing that muscle between your fingers that tissues between your fingers and really rubbed up fairly hard feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area 
cOCnNdL5fwI_1 from here to discuss short curly locks with you 
cOCnNdL5fwI_10 whether he's very fine hair and this goes to extra hot 
cOCnNdL5fwI_11 she 's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your high speed or your heart temperature 
cOCnNdL5fwI_12 the course or your hair as the hotter you will most likely needs your thumb styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair 
cOCnNdL5fwI_13 i drive this is so after the curl is the better it will be especially considering they're gonna fall 
cOCnNdL5fwI_14 so you can see that that curl is very tight varied ring with me 
cOCnNdL5fwI_15 that 's what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair 
cOCnNdL5fwI_16 it 's going to help you achieve your style and it's there 's going to help you maintain your movement maintain your chorale and also its volume 
cOCnNdL5fwI_2 the choice that you're going to want to use to create a curl up can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your house 
cOCnNdL5fwI_3 crying irons come in various diameter as they come very small you're half inch they go to three quarter inch the one inch the one and a half inch and then the two 
cOCnNdL5fwI_4 the water the larger the diameter of the use of the wave is going to be 
cOCnNdL5fwI_5 when somebody like heathers hair you must take into consideration the weight of her hair 
cOCnNdL5fwI_6 if i was to use this on this section it would only do one term it will be very very loose and he would do something like this are shorter here just to kind of give a little devil around the face 
cOCnNdL5fwI_7 scientists agree with you get the hair to either go under or flip out the smaller diameter or s on her hair 
cOCnNdL5fwI_8 another great benefit with a criteria such as this one is it does have a heat adjustment on it 
cOCnNdL5fwI_9 adjustment more about for you to adjust the heat to order cater to your hair 
cS44xaCZy7A_0 we're now going to start lunging the horse 
cS44xaCZy7A_1 will notice that i still have the chain over by horses nose 
cS44xaCZy7A_2 he says give me a little bit more control 
cS44xaCZy7A_3 i also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides to want to behave and stay on the circle 
cS44xaCZy7A_4 it also lets you grip the lines like a little bit better 
cS44xaCZy7A_5 cows and have lunch with and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also close arena 
cS44xaCZy7A_6 if something does go wrong he can get out 
cS44xaCZy7A_7 so i'm not going to start by just letting him come until small circle around me 
cYAlaOtYJw8_0 next trick we're going to be doing is calling grind transfer 
cYAlaOtYJw8_1 the trick based off grinding 
cYAlaOtYJw8_10 but anyway you do it your transferring the ground from one hand to the next 
cYAlaOtYJw8_11 lots of variations 
cYAlaOtYJw8_12 i'm going to show you my favorite which is the one from the arm to the arm 
cYAlaOtYJw8_13 so what you want to do 
cYAlaOtYJw8_14 we start with your non throw him out and just practice plan and a gliding down there 
cYAlaOtYJw8_15 it 's going to sit there for a couple of seconds get the feel for it 
cYAlaOtYJw8_16 eventually what you want to do is as grind up to your hand and this is one you bring your other hand and intercepted 
cYAlaOtYJw8_17 so try us again 
cYAlaOtYJw8_18 so the oil lands on your non throw hand it comes up and this is when you bring your other hand 
cYAlaOtYJw8_19 straight across 
cYAlaOtYJw8_2 basically you're moving from one part of your body to another 
cYAlaOtYJw8_20 i'm going to show you in real time with this looks like again 
cYAlaOtYJw8_21 again you need a really strong throw it's really important they are really strong throw when you're doing this 
cYAlaOtYJw8_22 needs to keep up the mountain from one hand to the next 
cYAlaOtYJw8_23 we should already have good grinding skills from the first grain video with and we just went over the basic grind 
cYAlaOtYJw8_24 practice that practice controlling up your arm get that really strong and good 
cYAlaOtYJw8_25 it 's really important that you can do that well if you want to be able to transfer from one on to the next 
cYAlaOtYJw8_26 practice that and you'll be able to transfer your grinds 
cYAlaOtYJw8_3 transfer and the as its grinding from one person 
cYAlaOtYJw8_4 let me show you what it looks like 
cYAlaOtYJw8_5 goes from one arm to the other 
cYAlaOtYJw8_6 i think this is a really smooth looking trick it shows we have a lot of control over the air 
cYAlaOtYJw8_7 going from one arm to the next 
cYAlaOtYJw8_8 other variations you can do 
cYAlaOtYJw8_9 some people in atlanta and their palm and shared across

cwLJfXFf9ks_0 the principles of aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations 
cwLJfXFf9ks_1 it can be applied in your family with your spouse with your kids 
cwLJfXFf9ks_10 that that last technique as phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction 
cwLJfXFf9ks_11 we can see exactly what they're saying 
cwLJfXFf9ks_12 we can get a little different perspective 
cwLJfXFf9ks_13 if we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately 
cwLJfXFf9ks_14 as he attacks he was turned on 
cwLJfXFf9ks_15 if everything is blending and harmonizing 
cwLJfXFf9ks_16 some can be a little bit more direct 
cwLJfXFf9ks_17 others can just not connect with that energy 
cwLJfXFf9ks_18 if it's negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it 
cwLJfXFf9ks_19 many different ways as you can see to to deal with each individual situation and principles will help you deal with that in daily life 
cwLJfXFf9ks_2 can be applied at work within an irate boss or coworkers 
cwLJfXFf9ks_3 could be upset drivers 
cwLJfXFf9ks_4 it could be something that road rage 
cwLJfXFf9ks_5 we're going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques just to emphasize the principles and we just take a peek 
cwLJfXFf9ks_6 for example if there's somebody coming at you with road rage is probably best not to to block not to stop them with your car but just to let him go right by with a look something like this 
cwLJfXFf9ks_7 children 
cwLJfXFf9ks_8 so that's one way you can just let them go right by 
cwLJfXFf9ks_9 if you need to deal with a situation a little bit more it might look something like this 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_1 yogurt is a bulgarian yogurt nonfat so it's very healthy to lomong the sour side as far as yogurt go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_10 definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt it's so good 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_11 yoga in the middle east is kind of like catch up here in the united states and that is it for the yogurt part of the honey 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_2 i would recommend losing middle eastern yogurt if you can on hummus because it just tastes so much better than regular yogurt and you get an a to b you can 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_3 we can usually find vanity to me and if you can then go to your local middle easterners store and they will have yogurt and i just want to ottawa about two tablespoons to yoke to your hummus 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_4 just give it a great flavor but it also makes thomas a little liquidity and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_5 a lot of people use olive oil in their hummus to make it a lot thinner than when it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out chunky 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_6 it's a lot better to get it more pure aid that way it has a better texture into it 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_7 this yogurt again like i said as nonfat it also comes in a version that is not nonfat so you can pick whatever one you like but it's definitely very good yogurt 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_8 here 's my favorite and i think it's white mountain foods 
cxW8HFCWjlQ_9 you can go in order this 
dIIMHOX5AD8_0 another we've covered walking property let's work on focusing on one point so we're actually moving or we're moving up the body as we go 
dIIMHOX5AD8_1 one point if you can look at the center of mass is going to be belly button anywhere from two to three inches down dependent so right about where this boat 
dIIMHOX5AD8_10 and we will continue on this subject and shortly thereafter 
dIIMHOX5AD8_2 now one point is the principle of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place 
dIIMHOX5AD8_3 one way of thinking of it is that if you have somebody its tensile strength 
dIIMHOX5AD8_4 and if you have somebody grab onto your arm there ought to be a living breathing connection that yes you there it feels very strong it feels like a fire hose 
dIIMHOX5AD8_5 fire hoses almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it 
dIIMHOX5AD8_6 living entity and therefore one point is very much the same thing it is living entity 
dIIMHOX5AD8_7 you 're looking for that constant relaxed natural power of tensile strength 
dIIMHOX5AD8_8 not muscular by any means and it is certainly not structural it but there is well i shouldn't say that because there is an aspect of structural to it 
dIIMHOX5AD8_9 with correct structure and correct relaxation you build on on tensile strength 
dKumOzqVk3M_0 hello this is a j b with asr homebrew supply in austin texas 
dKumOzqVk3M_1 talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at drone home 
dKumOzqVk3M_10 subsequently its food grade 
dKumOzqVk3M_11 in other words there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal patrol and sort of liver cancer can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here 
dKumOzqVk3M_12 said 
dKumOzqVk3M_13 these guys are called food grade palms 
dKumOzqVk3M_14 were made by a company called march and these guys do a great job of moving hot boiling were or beer from point a to point b without having to pick up big kettles full of hot boiling liquid 
dKumOzqVk3M_15 so 
dKumOzqVk3M_16 food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing 
dKumOzqVk3M_2 wine or cider socks 
dKumOzqVk3M_3 we got a lot of different things you can make here 
dKumOzqVk3M_4 
dKumOzqVk3M_5 one of the things you want to do at the end of or during the process of making beer especially bear making or even wine is you need a rack or transfer we have some strange terminology nerve wracking means to transfer from point a to point b 
dKumOzqVk3M_6 so especially if they're making la times you're moving hot liquids from one point to another especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point 
dKumOzqVk3M_7 what 's going to be real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it 
dKumOzqVk3M_8 so so that being said we carry food grade pumps that the reason their food grade is there's a space between where the motor housing is in the actual pump drive with a magnetic dry between 
dKumOzqVk3M_9 a complete difference between the motor and where the actual liquid comes through 
dQJyDM9pKR8_0 fluoride is a messiah stroke that it's basically just stroking the horse 
dQJyDM9pKR8_1 and you can do it either with your hands with your fingers clothes and just stroking down the side of the horse keeping one hand on the horse all the time or you're doing 
dQJyDM9pKR8_2 you can have your fingers more open inserted a cone shape stroking down the side of the horse starting at the pole and working all the way back 
dQJyDM9pKR8_3 but it's actually a fairly safe stroke to use either form of flourish horses most likely they almost always enjoy it 
dQJyDM9pKR8_4 they don't find it to be too invasive it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the unless you're being really careless it's a fairly safe strove to be using 
dQJyDM9pKR8_5 so again i'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of calming on the horse or having your fingers clothes and stroking down the sides of the horse 
dQJyDM9pKR8_6 just patting them 
dQJyDM9pKR8_7 it 's a nice gentle stroke it helps him to relax 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_0 tim gibson m talking about troubleshooting your refrigerator 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_1 if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator first two things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not trapped in your main breaker box 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_10 recommended settings are anywhere from about thirty four degrees to thirty eight degrees depending i really how how cold you like to keep some of your product particularly dairy products 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_11 then the other side here on the phrase or side some of the common thing you can run into is whether your ice maker is not distributing eyes properly or your waters now coming out 
dWOtJxrH_Ww_12 waters are coming out most of these are equipped with a filter so in this case this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filtering and it tells you when to replace it
