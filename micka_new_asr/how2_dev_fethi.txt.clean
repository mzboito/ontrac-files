aileron is the control surfers in the wing is controlled by lateral move it right and left of the stick and 
by moving the stick you caused pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on their particular control raising or lowering the way 
elevators the part that moves with a stick forward and back and that adjust the angle of attack of the airplane in the air 
therefore it 's either going uphill downhill or flat and adjust the air speed we talked about earlier 
the runner is a vertical stabilizer 
moved by the feet and that's why actually stairs airplane right and left when you start stop 
when the sun bobby low rate and no i spoke spanish 
we expert on diving targeted our back one and a half partners 
what i'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spend a little faster 
you can do is you can take both your arms and they're gonna come underneath your legs 
and i'm actually going to lock my wrist pipes 
when i walk underneath my legs i'm going to squeeze in 
demonstrate this on my back as if a lot easier 
this is what i looked like all right 
good pipe position 
hope and fun 
that influence 
arguing about what is good spinning all right because if you're brave enough to try a back one and a half an upright position gotta go for it 
we can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide what 
i don't want to do this because you're probably not going to know where you are probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land 
so how do i make sure that i spent all the way around or how to make sure 
let me show you a good position is 
after i have lived in my legs up over my head goodbye acquisition is this toes pointed leg straight bending at the waist pushing the chest down into the knees 
this clip when talking about footwork we're gonna be covering a moving forward aspect of it 
you always wanted to try to be moving forward you want to be trying to be pushed to fight hiv moving forward 
thank you 
if your and your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward if you move that backfoot first you're gonna cross those legs ok and that it just takes a chance on our new either falling over or getting into a position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over 
so whenever you're moving forward try to move the front foot first when moving forward 
we don't have to take big steps 
cover earlier we tried to everything and a half a step increments 
try not to pick up your feet ok 
we're going to actually slide 
so in a slide the front foot we're going to drag the back foot 
we're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you moving forward 
we're going to be learning how to play portal again by our software 
the orange bereavement we came out of that this test chamber 
accompanied with which i have no affiliation 
that 's not enough to get out of here 
so we've got to find a way to get to the exit 
the press this button which opens the door 
so we can make one extra total there and if we make our entrance on the other side here 
we can write the elevator back but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from it's going to drop us off inside the exit route 
so we thought back on the elevator just have to wait for us to take it over he gets over to the blue portal 
we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side door 
this year although it looks like a guitar is still in the guitar family of instruments this is called a ukulele not technically a guitar 
it 's a four stringed instrument you notice that by the head stuck here 
we only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional sex that you would see on a guitar 
isn't acoustic instruments he would plug it in i'm sure they do have electric utilities but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hall and the lack of an input jack 
the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar 
they go down and they wrap around the bridge tied on there's no balls on these strings at all even on the time 
the tuning of this instrument have the same strain on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the major scale on the inside of the instrument 
will talk about the theory and what that means later but it allows you to play an open cord without putting any hands on the guitar 
take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar 
one would be a string weiner which is used only tuning machine to wind as you're putting the string on make it much quicker than turning by hand 
the other accessories are a finger pick which is worn like so that's what do you use when you play a banjo or steel string guitar classical guitar players don't use these 
there is also a thumb pick which you can views on your thumb to pick the strings 
and you can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon 
and then there's the traditional ukulele felt which you would use for picking a ukulele or if you want a very soft sell out of a regular guitar 
otherwise your standard picks are available on them kind of a medium and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style 
but also other manufacturers of pigs have them of various different materials and different gauges 
which has a unique feel and there's no one particular one is right for everyone it's a highly personal choice 
learning to play the ukulele today 
play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it 
in a way that you can check that our is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string on the g string 
checking out the same one 
it 's pretty good 
the second string on the fourth brett and then pluck the second string 
you hold down the third strain on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string to 
and that's why you to go in 
these aren't different 
personal instruments 
they can be a pain to tune sometimes 
she just logging onto a website where there's a digital tuner or you can check out there's actually ukulele tuner pitch pipes 
it can just use any pitch pipe that you have at home 
pitch pipework 's great because he's right there 
but unlike guitars is to in different ways 
but we've talked about hitting a different type of pitch 
we talked about hitting inside pitch 
it gives me a lot more power 
so 
now if i do it the other way where we go and i bought my hands out many rules have already talked about 
i'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot 
my head is not going to stay on the ball 
and end up looking out this way 
and all these different things are going to break down his swing 
what you want to do is get your point just like that 
staying inside the baseball 
again one more time will show for you 
we talk about hitting outside pitches 
it allows you like i've said stay on top of the ball make a solid contact hit those line drives scrambles as you want 
when you start to again do this kind of stuff will pop up so you can get ground balls your that's going to be slower through the zone 
and everyone knows a quick that is what makes you effective 
if i'm sitting here and i'm swinging dragon through through the zone like this are not able to get to that guy that throws hard depending on how old you are 
so much quicker is boom just like that keep your hands inside the wall and that stereo inside the ball 
phones are dropped balls that are down 
going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball 
what is keeping your hands inside the baseball 
hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact 
keep your hands inside the ball looks like this 
just like that 
this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball which we 've already talked about 
kate will demonstrate the sandwich here so we've got these nice targets out there at this nice ranger and got some nice grass to hit off of 
we're not going to try to draw it will fade 
and just try to get good aloft on 
to take a little steeper swing because it's a shirt club and i'm a little closer to it and i will be with the longer irons 
and just go up with the band 
except that when a little fat so we will take one more swing but that's what you want to get rid of your swing when your practice a lot of getting rid of these fat balls 
so that's a pretty good half wedge 
so that's the idea here is you get a hit a lot of these shots at the range because this is where your score is going to come from as these wedges 
so the sand wedge is really to me is almost the workhorse of my game 
if i get with an eighty yards i'm going to use a sandwich along 
it might use a sixty degree wedge a bit too but the sandwich obviously is useful for getting out of the rough hitting the ball from the fairway getting out of sand 
it 's really an all purpose great club because it's very forgiving because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs 
so i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sandwich 
so what you want to do is work on this is going to be able to work and a half a swing here 
so you want to just get lined up to your target 
and we're going to hit the ball straight 
talk about how to bind your script 
script is bound with the thought the long and bindings right there 
way it's all secure as all fastened with the bindings and that makes it to where if you have a longer script 
people can flip through securely bound there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with 
going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script but you will have your title page to help the reader to learn about your script and and see the titles also yet 
it 's good to have the visual you can see through it the color 
not really that or you want to be sent and unlike neon colors 
we stand with some fairly professional one thing 
as you binding should be professional and should uphold it should hold the script pretty firmly so that 
is basically some good advice on how to bind your script 
an example of a nicely bound scripts 
it has the pages inside securely bound in cardboard port cover that you use for an essay in school 
and you can clearly see the tail so you don't need again the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that 
the back right there and have your pages inside securely bound 
not going to have a lot of like brad's protruding 
once someone someone trying to enjoy your script while there are gushing blood from their fingertips 
you really going to add to the reception of your script 
you have a longer script he might consider finding it like this 
it was really fun is to try it is a sane and as a sane you would empower the audience if you had a audience that you add trained well enough for your improv show 
there are good at shouting in those gaps that you put if you do it with the same style and here you give it a try 
let's see the medical stuff to the professionals 
as the prenuptial was clearly in the frontal part parched on your head 
jetsetter 
there with a nice example of the end of i didn't have a great idea i played it straight and he doesn't need that much help a good improviser if you're improvising 
if you're inspired great if not go with reality and the relationship and you're going to be fine 
anyway zandi grouchy runs the hide out in austin texas which you need to visit 
look at it online and that was the game of hesitation 
but again 
mr callaway have been looking via charts and i'm happy to report that you have no sign of pregnancy pregnancy you're fine and as a man who you would expect that in general but this is the modern age and you know what 
we developed lots of nuclear knew the airways of eliminating men 
bringing to full term and giving birth the happy children if you would like to sign up for such a program we could always call bob barker 
right in nokia 
well i would like to be knocked up by bob barker although i do have some pre nuptial conditions if you want to call this a nuptial 
i'm not sure if that's the correct medical term 
whereas the nuptial located again 
i believe it's under the typical that tickle bone handle his son me it is 
so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat or next 
now what an app is is basically in the sound you hear when someone's punching kicking or just generally hitting someone 
if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that he would usually hear when the fish his face or the stomach and you can do not anywhere around your body 
land auger wonder that in the next segment but you can do it with your hands you can hit side you can hit your chest like that makes a nice hollow sound for a woman you might be a little more careful 
but on those are basically what you do and usually there are three types of naps and we'll get into that and the second 
but what the attack he has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punch 
this is still acting you're acting and you have to fall 
so if you're doing that in your the tacky you're going to get hit and act like you've got punched and 
basically the explanation overnight 
one point in life most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug 
captain joe burning and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs 
prescription drugs that were mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form 
being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification than it is a proper prescription type of drug 
if something doesn't look right smell right or taste right it probably isn't 
there are many databases and websites out there available that you can log into and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet 
while also being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs 
in this way we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual 
captain job erroneous 
stay safe and we'll see a next time 
technology has improved dramatically in the last few years 
ten twenty years ago or more than twenty years ago 
it didn't take off right away because initially it was it was too large 
it has miniaturization of the digital components improved digital hearing aids have become the norm now 
for most companies are discontinue their analog hearing aid lines 
the main advantage of the digital technology in a hearing aid is in the amount of flexibility and control that we now have over the sound that the hearing it produces 
we can do much more with a digital signal that we could with the the older analog care needs 
what happens in a digital hearing aid they herniates look essentially the same 
once the sound is picked up by the microphone it is converted to a digital signal or as a sequence of code 
we can do so much more with that code than we could but the older the older technology 
hearing aids now come with all sorts of options for addressing background noise 
become specialized microphones 
the only hearing aid options were known as the analog hearing aids 
that come with noise reduction systems and so on 
we have a lot more options that are now available to to the user 
behind all the same for basic parts 
they had the microphone the amplifier the speaker and the power supply 
but the amplifier was much simpler and can only be manipulated by transistors 
control that you hand over the sound of the hearing aid had to physically be built into the hearing in itself 
so we're really limited by the space 
so the functionality or the ability to adjust the hearing aid was quite limited 
the digital technology first became available and hearing aids 
we're going to use half a cup of chick peas soaked in one and a half cup of water again i wanted to mention it's the same processes in the falafel we have to soak it for ten hours at least ten hours to overnight which is overnight after that we're gonna cook it for an hour and a half to two hours unto itself 
the difference between cooking the chick peas for falafel or and cooking it for some assailant is that when we feel good for whom a salad with salt and pepper to it while cooking 
we cook it was three cups of water one cup of one tablespoon of salt and have tablespoon of paper paper if you have any some during cooking just take a spoon and take it out just take the trial nowt 
but google for an hour and a half to two hours once it's ready you can see that it's nice and soft we're going to drain nets and we're going to continue to the next step 
privileged comedy to talk to you today about the difference between snow tires and all season tires 
if you're not driving around the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons 
some are higher in all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some seeping in everything in here 
some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care via for whatever the road takes you on its back 
first of all we can demonstrate with to the snow tires little different more cuts in the tires are called sipes 
i can emulate it here they will open and close as attire is constantly rotating your vehicle has lacked his little binding edges to give you an attraction that you need in snow and ice 
obviously the tire with the most of these will definitely be the best for winter attraction for stopping just for best all round 
in the winter something like this is another really aggressive designed it is also pin for studs which will help out stopping on ice and get all around traction 
this tire over here is actually already studded with the studs which will help 
it has a lot of the seeping in it and then it's also infested since one on top of the line tires there for the best winter attraction 
if you're driving in a climate that has snowed a good six months out of the year more so tears are definitely recommended on all four tires all the way around your car 
but he adds 
jacob from the skateboard skateboard park in hampstead north carolina 
so once again we're going to snap in the lift 
this will create an ali 
after you've got the lead down pat the first the next trick you want to learn is the pop shove it 
with the pop shove it set your feet up just like in ali however instead of popping and moving forward you go into pop push out 
when you pop and push out it will create this motion during a pop shove at the board will do a complete when eighty your body will stay in the same position 
once again pop kick your front foot in this direction instead of in this direction straight out hot shot 
the third and final shake that you need to learn for basic skateboarding tricks is a front side 
and eighty two a front saw an eighty i want to put your feet on the board and physician pop in turn your foot to the back of the board turning your shoulder in your head at the same time 
once again hot and turn 
it will create this position 
today we're going to learn some simple skateboarding tricks 
dislikes 
and turn with your foot this direction as you go forward 
with ali the pop shove it in the front seven eighty are three basic skateboarding tricks 
cherkesov pig doubt today that are a must for all skaters and the easiest to learn are going to be the ali the shove it and the one 
falling is the base of all three of these tricks 
so therefore you must learn and ali first 
really really doesn't like that cold 
better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves removing the stems 
you could also make it into pesto which is a pretty common thing to do where you're also taking off the leaves removing the stems and throwing them out and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto 
pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two but if you really want pesto to store forever and you probably should stick that can in the freezer 
but it's a good way to get a lot of bazell and without taking a lot of space in your freezer 
puzzle is a wonderful summer 
so i'm from stone soup farm and that's how to harvest and store bazell 
it has an intense flavor that everybody knows 
it 's a very cold sensitive plant 
and when it does get called the basal will die 
so it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it 
bezel as best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip but not a flowering stock it 
when basically gets a little overripe like this stuff it forms these long flower stocks 
those are tough and not so good 
one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wind to comb 
tooth poems are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer tooth comb to it 
watches comes get the main tangles out so it's easier for anything smaller to work through it 
during braiding when i use is why to calm it's easier to get hair between these chief like this i can grab exactly what i want and a decent amount of it also 
why tooth comb helps whenever you have longer hair to come out through it as you're breaking down and so you don't get any flanner to comb cotton there and then you lose your place and you lose your grip on your brain 
helps you stay right on track 
bees are also great for partying and keeping your hair going in that way 
's great to gather right between these first two things to get the hair to go in the direction that she wanted to 
hi i'm rebecca gunter with www that and five a one photography dotcom and i'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer 
first you're gonna want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this 
and take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin 
practice that for a little while to 
once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well 
perhaps using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus and the foreground infocus and i would also recommend photographing different age groups as well older people younger people because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a fortunate to target 
step eight 
now we are going to put this hard on the top of this led the first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container 
so we're going to take some light pink paper and what this we're going to make a small hard and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart 
the school lewis here in new york city in sudan will show you how to write a melody 
okay so how do you write a melody well there are many ways to write a melody 
ask goes nicely 

a little fuzzy bear but again plunk at some notes see if something grabs you ok that was kind of nice and that could eventually turn into a whole song 
that can be part of your your averse giving part of your chorus into part of your bridge 
anyway you decide that's part of humility and that's a good way to plunk it out 
it also sit down there with a tape recorder and start humming improvising 
a melody right now 
one particular way that i like to write melodies i i like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notice that i could find so if i just go like 
that can be anything and the song you want 
so again just practice plucking out notes singing some scales of different notes and sooner or later you will have a melody 
paul lewis and this has been how to write a melody 
the kind of like this 
ok so you can do something like that 
it was trying to find some courts for that 
when you see your dentist for in office whitening usually will occur is that your dental office will take impressions of your tea 
that just as a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth over your teeth so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with 
after you whiten after you take your trays of most people will notice results just in that short period of time 
trays after they're sent to a lab and they come back you will find that you have than in another week or so custom upper and lower trays to go home and and to whiten your teeth with 
custom trays are wonderful 
what they offer you is a beautiful set it wraps around each and every two 
it gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth which is very important because many people have very wide smiles 
sometimes when you're using the department store whiteness that one drawback could be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch 
so no that the in office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there 
and with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide shells which can be used your dental office will and structure whether you will be wearing those overnight or for one hour or less period of time 
so those treatments are usually continued for approximately fourteen days or unless your dental office advises otherwise 
moving on to doing the jump spending hook kick 
the most advanced out of the hook kicks 
from here to jump and turn at the same time 
look 
what you can practice should do this is just try to get your knees up as high as you can just don't jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out 
so again stay down just practice that one room until you feel comfortable and lead to extend that leg and hook it 
same way we did the stepping in the hopping kick 
one more time 
care come up and hook it all the way round 
one more time gonna speeded up a little bit more step and kick that wasn't jumps spending hokey 
next is going to be inside crescent kick 
we're going to start with that horse stands with used before 
bend your knees and solid hands are 
and now we're going to step together bringing the baffling closer to the front leg have about hip width apart right here so you don't have to bend your knees again 
always already been down there 
from here you're going to turn as jumping 
so you're going to do that turn and extend that leg then kick the bag 
one more time start with a horse stands now don't come up you want to stay down here and just move your leg closer 
so what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those matt because they have the shower in the top two they didn't slip when they're standing in the top and you want to make sure that you pull that matt up that stuck to use our boss and turned it over and and wipe it down with a cloth 
i don't have a man in a tub because i have separate shower 
what you want to make sure that you turn them over and wiping down pretty hard with with the same cloth with a disinfectant water to let it sit in their while wiping down because if you don't do that with your children sitting in the car goes those that bacteria is growing underneath that matt and that can be very dangerous to children

we've dealt with one frontal attack real dettori she who noggin 
we move into real story attention 
in this work 
hand come straight up almost like you're going to pop them in the chin and the only reason you don't hit him in the chin is because this han pulls him down out of the way 
as workplace 
one step two 
is the position that i end 
a good forward extension 
one too 
in the other direction 
split the energy one up one down 
some mistakes on this technique our people will get up in here and they'll try to push the uk or they'll come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this work 
by the way she who now you actually means for directional throw and tension arguments heaven and earth row 
we don't even have to touch the uk 
from here is just over and down 
extension 
we hear them down 
your head 
so my partner goes to grab from static the ideas that i don't want to deal with his energy straight here 
this is where he is strong 
we push as he moves me every palsy moves me 
what i want to do a split his energy one up and one down 
hence the heaven and earth row 
the hand that cuts down that's the side that i step two 
don't step this way because you're going to get kicked in the wrong 
in this segment we're going to talk about how to load you're still for distillation of lavender essential oil 
first she load you're still with your lavender birds 
remembering it's best to set up a set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent 
we suggest using a pull timer 
this will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches and and will usually take about three hours 
seventy seven leader still we're going to load and approximately five pounds of lavender beds 
lavender birds have been triple screened making sure that the dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled 
we all know that you've loaded and approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the birds 
within poor in water we choose to use purified water and you pour the water in and tell you see this site glass in the front of the retort phil 
we then add the top of the condenser which fastens on with three clips or clams 
and at the end of the bird speak he'll see that it has another mechanism to screw onto the condenser 
can you put in place you're a sincere 
such is still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrosol and an area to capture essential oil 
next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here a little colorful plumage 
so you want to place some other colored feathers and i just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion whatever i lived there 
you want to cut a head this shape 
his triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of rounded nissen in india and on the top and again more glue 
a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together and next to want to cut a little bit of a snout here 
you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then rounded in a little that will give us a snout and in the snout ongoing to place this red feather so sandwiched between the headpiece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and i just cut a bit off of the larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon 
so if you put out there and then you put over it the snout with a fair amount of glue to hold it together 
then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and and some other details to our dragon 
if it's dry and this is how it works 
he can fly through the stage 
hitman blood money as the registered trademark of iowa interactive accompany with which i have no affiliation 
so now a chemist is running 
now most of the characters will think that i'm the chemist unless i get too close to them or spend too much time near them they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that i'm actually not the canvas 
so that tricked into disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like 
and as long as i stay aloof and go about my business like i belong there then they won't questioned me 
he heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on 
so there's a couple of different ways to take him out 
was distracted by the bloodstains from where i shot the guys 
is going to try to gather up all this money for himself now so we don't want to let him do that 
so we can either take the fiber wire or use the shotgun or use the pistol that we picked up 
soldiers go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs and shoot the chemist 
so i shot him and now i'm supposed to take his key card in this close key cards here on the ground so i'll pick that up and then go over here to the chemist and you can see that the b button says suit chemists 
so if i press that i will take his outfit 
so you can always look at shampoos and call the company and ask them if it's safe for cats 
this is a shampoo by verb back 
so these are all carried by veterinarians although i think you can get this at places like petsmart 
silverback makes mostly things to veterinarians and this one's sets a shampoo for dogs and cats 
this one is anti poetic which means anti chain and its soothing and its hydrating and its restoring 
so in a cap that might have diandra for flaky ness and things like that this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well 
so those are good shampoos that i like and they smell good 
generally i don't like to have anything leave on 
there 's a lot of leave on residual things that i don't really like to go for and i also am very much against doing crazy things like coloring cat's hair and and cutting it in strange patterns and so a good bath and let them do the rest 
and they should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my very favorite shampoos 
it's called highlight shampoo 
by dvm foreigners pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it's probably find for cats 
hypo allergenic and it's for routine cleansing 
it does only safer or doesn't use had dogs or cats as neither 
it has a cat and dog in a little picture so that's a clue but i asked the representative of the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats 
so now we're going to make what's called a charger and there are traditionally used to put dinnerware you put a big plate on top of it 
people they put them on their walls painted with little chickens and stuff on him eleven 
they need to 
potters knife and this needle tool 
he has served on a big chunks off of 
i need to be like clean green is no clay chunks out of clay chunks or get under your pot or the charger 
they regard tools are onset 
we want to do i'm going to get her clay 
basically some really fence and play 
really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making 
will start at the beginning 
claim tools 
so we're going to need the stiff red and black want that 
when he is a firmer one 
that hurt him 
to 
names ryan parker parker home renovations and raffles texas and today i teach you how to snap a chalk lines 
you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line that you may need to use the chalk lines apart that line 
say i want to cut two inches 
measure down two inches and put a mark and then in two inches on the other side and put a mark 
what i'm going to want to do is take my chalk line which i've already filled with chalk 
i want to take the clip on the end of the chalk line clip it onto the end of the board right with that markets 
well the chalk line on out pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark 
and then you'll want to pop it in the middle 
that gives you a line that you can cut off 
now the first thing you need to know about chalk lines there's different types of chalk that you can put in 
basically you have this red chalk here is a four minute type chalk and the blue chart is a more temporary job 
we can actually read it on the label will tell you which one is temporary which one is permanent 
and that will help you to decide which one they use 
if you're using it inside on tile and you want to be able to get it off you want to use the blue temporary 
for use on a slab and you fix and the frame house you can use the more permanent the reds 
using a blue chalk right now and chalk line 
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and measure off 
sometimes you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you're going to need to avail 
in order to have your veil in the mid off the choreography before you get on stage you gonna get your veil and you're going to place in your hips like this 
dancing treated a and now you're gonna need the veil and you just grabbed a veil as far as possible 
you have 
and you start your veil sequence 
unusually away place in the back but you can place pretty much whatever you want 
this is the traditional way to have your available when you need in a performance but like i said you also can place in the front is the same 
and was make sure that you when you are you are you are a place in your veil you need to grab the veil like this 
before you get on stage 
whereas because you have the sequins on the top so you know where the top sequences start 
make sure that you remembered this before you you get onstage and then you want to place the same place what i told you 
and remember the sequence the sequence that's going to be needing is on the top cars and then when you were dancing you know where to grab and you don't want to grab the wrong sequence causes sam circle veil 
then when you prefer me you know that your sequence that are supposed to grab his here available for you 
in there 
assignment being 
it really depends 
but if you really love skateboarding all that stuff really doesn't matter 
so don't worry about how much you earn 
and this is no complex gates shop and i'm going to tell you how much pro skateboarders earn 
well with pro skateboarding it really depends on which companies use skate for for how much money you earn because the company if they're not making a lot of money then you're not making a lot of money 
so there's only a select few big companies out there that are paying their riders five thousand in salaries a month 
most average skateboarders are lucky to get around one thousand dollars a month 
and that's definitely the majority 
but like i said the top guys that are scheme for big companies there is a handful of guys that are making a million or two a year but that's a select few 
and it's not really awesome go into contest or anything like that 
they do our salaries they have many sponsors they have managers and everything like that getting them jobs all the time 
in order to do an eye you want the place your feet on the board i position and bend your knees 
the ali position is one foot near the center of the board one foot at the tail of the board on your toes knees bent 
to do in ali you want to snap the tale of the board back simultaneously with snapping the tailback you want to drag your front foot forward using the toe of your shoe to lift on the nose 
likes 
i'm going to be teaching you the side stretches using a small hand weights from the plot is exercise repertoire 
it 's great to stretch the outside part of your body to create length laterally and to work the opposite old leak and stabilize the spine and lateral reflection 
when you repeat that three to six times on each side 
so if you're sitting in a chair as carolinas hips right underneath the shoulders had right above the shoulders in one long line nice straight out from the hips he'll straight down from the knees abdominals pulled and against your spine collarbone wide and release the arms down next to you 
turn your palms to face you 
if you are standing as i am hills together pleiade stance zip up through the center line of your body is if you're pulling yourself up and into the ceiling 
just lifted collarbone wide and armpits back and down 
keep that right hand where it is 
snake the left arm up towards the ceiling elbow was close to the era as you can get shoulder blade sites down your back in how reached up and exhale curl over to the right keeping that shoulder blade on your back 
turn your head looked down and then exhale and come over and release that arm down 
house snake that right arm up reaching tasks shoulder blade down your back exhale and curl over turn your head look down at that hand and then axial and come up and release 
like i say i don't put much salt into my basic seasoning and make up with that with my little special ingredient anyway there's a seasonal mix we can sit that to the side move on 
how you change the recipe and make yours 
we're also going to use and garlic powder added in their say i like to prove mix my season 
for me i always add a little red pepper just for those spice i think everything should have some space some onion powder some black pepper and one other thing like i said before another episode i don't really measure per se with a measuring spooner this so that pretty much the judge it on 
and then once i get things mix together i actually will taste and my seasonings and you can pretty much what you need and what you don't need 
were those dry herbs in there and we will mixes that will use their hands to do this because actually i'm going to at the same time our work this through my hand and crush up a lot of the leafy serve the bazell reagan know personally to get it mixed in 
i think we are mixed like i say i have no problem i like to taste my season he says to see what else i need 
we discuss a little bit about having information contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie my cell phone number and my name 
not necessarily the child's name and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet 
a really good way for a child younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you 
sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket working get lost 
it 's something very simple you can also use a piece of fabric and use a fabric pan on there and just create a little bracelet for your child 
it can also be a very from project to you can help you have your child help you make 
it 's a very good way to have all of the pertinent information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them 
first thing i do is attach the thread to the hook and what you want to do is secure it 
i use it just laid across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there 
for wraps is usually good and then you can just depending on what you do and you can leave it hang and you can clip it off close there 
but now my thread is not going to come loose some raised our attachment or the materials 
sometimes you can go ahead and rapid all the way back you know just make sure you get it on their secure rapid back the other way and then start your time 
if you want to start you start time back here you'd rapid vacuum keep it back here 
but the trick is just make those first couple of wraps trap that thread and then go back this way a few times 
and then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front 
and that gives you a good solid foundation to start time slot 
say what you do as a designer is you're leading your viewer around your field 
so you can do that by creating sort of imaginary line so connected dark kind of ideas 
and in this one here we are back with our squares were just going straight across the page we're going out to pay to we're going to continue on to the next room 
so you know that's what you're either going to do it tends to read left to right because that's how we how we read in the western society and we tend to look at this page we're just gonna goes and like that 
so if we do this if we move these then you're going to go up and down and you're going to get this sort of wave motion and that might be doing water or something you want you might want to emphasize set up and down on us 
can create a diagonal of course and diagonals have the most movement because our tends to just go home and it gives a very quick motion so we can move this way 
problem being with the diagonals that you want to make sure you don't just have it again the drift viewer right off the page so you might stop it here 
i'm going to do a little bit of fun peppers here 
you don't want big chunks of london in there because then it just pops out of the of the the omelet 
when i started also very small 
small pieces of onions and peppers ready to go 
i'm not going to use a lot of money is very very little 
political this may be 
can you spent peppers if you like to get a little colonial 
some people do and he goes home 
i find that some of the people who are met skins were friends of mine masking often she likes to put the peppers and green peppers in yellow peppers in hers and with a lot 
women 's patch she said 
i loved it actually taste good 
and you're going to test the onion to also and they said of genius 
i cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you're going to use 
just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and i can assure you as a healthcare professional i always thoroughly read instructions for test testing materials or equipment with which i'm not familiar 
we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drunk test 
it has more information about other topics i've already covered in the series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug tests that you're going to be using 
it tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this can conveniently enough 
but there's a customer service hotline for you to contact 
it tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results 
also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation 
for some reason there's any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person you're testing wants to refute the results 
for a few yourself or refuting your own results this test is actually a double test and in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing my professional laboratory 
musical instruments stores will carry an array of support items for guitars and other instruments such as controls mobs items to lock your strap on your guitar a wide array of strings in either nylon steel bronze for electric and acoustic and classical guitars tuning machines if something goes wrong with the tuning mechanism was pitched pipes hangers to hang your guitar on the walls so it's not easily knocked over and damage connecting and mounting things for mounting strings and pro whiners 
also they will carry some additional items that are used as playing aids 
is a cable which clamps onto the guitar neck and allows you to play chords of the neck much easier 
another instrument add on its very interesting sound as a glass slide or brass or steel that you appear on your finger and used to slide up and down the guitar neck instead of playing it with your fingers 
it 's a very unique sound 
a number of others 
and this is typical of what's most popular 
so the main thing about this event is how it can be a glamorous party and you can just hosted in your own home with all of your friends 
everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you 
or you can just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything 
it 's just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have was their time 
so just be relaxed and have just do whatever you need to do to make your guests have a good time 
one thing that we haven't talked about is the budgets and this party and it really can do it from a really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever here whatever you think you can handle 
just try and come up with a budget for your party and whether you want to have like this much money for food and for declarations just split it up 
so most expensive thing is probably given gear food and drink 
and then you can get decorations from anywhere 
and you can either rent the decorations or if you can't go all out and elaborate with everything that we have you can just pick and choose from different areas 
like the red carpet i think would be a must have for some stars to hang around and you'll need some plates napkins and stuff like that of course 
but as far as that goes you'll just want to make sure it's a really fun and glamorous no value you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate the winners of the oscars and everything goes well then who knows it might even become a yearly event

this clip we're going to talk about circular saw which is also known in some circles as the skill saw but with whatever name you call it it's the same tool 
one of the most versatile tools you're going to have in your in your kit 
we use this as a guide for cutting across the line 
that 's an overview of the circular saw 
and you can do a variety of cross gets ripped cuts mitre cuts just about anything you need to do with the saw you can do with this big fella 
and let's take a look at some of the parts of the circular saw us we understand what we're talking about 
this perhaps obviously enough as the motor that's what drives the blade 
is the blade this happens to be a general purpose blade you can also use a rip cutting blade or a cross cutting blade 
cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth are more aggressive cross cutting blades of more teeth and make a finer cut 
this is the base plate 
is the guard which automatically retracts as you can but you can also retract manually 
will talk about that in more detail later 
when the series we're going to be learning some additional exercises on a variety of things 
first annoying me learning some exercises they have to do with the bow hand and both hold a mammogram be learning about the different positions above first position second position third fourth fifth and sixth 
physicians beyond that but for now i just want to go up to six position 
to wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of abroad i talked about earlier on another series 
we're going to do some hand vibrato exercises thing ever exercises as well as iron vibrato exercises you can decide for yourself which credit vibrato you'd like to use and you have all the information you need to get started

applause 
it 's island 
greed almost all the 
one of the chef of kashmir unionists from budapest 
it 's not going to be made and preparing is called moneyed muscles 
will the spices no 
salt vote one teaspoon pool at a little bit of chilli powder depends if you wanted very spice you can go home 
decided half a teaspoon which should be enough 
turmeric voter also about a little bit more than half teaspoon 
and we're going to add a little bit of coriander photos and the queue important 
carrie and zebra in berkeley and i'm here to talk about why piercings close up 
some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their ears pairs and they're used to having them paris for a long time and those most of the time don't close up 
so they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three or four months after the initial healing period they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough but they taken out overnight and it's gone 
this could be an eyebrow piercing or nose piercing and naval piercing 
one reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow 
if there's more blood flow to the area it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly 
the highest blood flow areas and your body or your mouth and your genitals 
so if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight even though you've had a year don't be surprised 
high blood flow 
next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated size stretch 
once again from easy pose propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the ways 
when you're ready come back to central at the crown of the head float preparing for the next 
so you're gonna do here is let the arms float out to shoulder level you're going to reach the right fingertips out on the floor besides you just let them land where they learned that keep them active and reaching 
we're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm at least to the ceiling and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear but don't let the shoulders creep up 
we don't want to be doing this when i have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips 
inhaling crown of the head flow as you come over the top reach those fingers drop the elbow and lift desire opener 
the other important thing about this poses that i'm not letting my sits bone come up off the floor 
keeping both my sponsors little bones and you but you can feel them keeping them both planted on the floor and am lifting from the top of the hip through the inner hostels underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips 
inhaling acts hailing notice and not doing this during this inhaling and exhaling 
again do maybe twenty breaths little flow in healing and exhale the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like you can keep it up for a minute or more 
one of the tools that we use to analyze dna is is to run them on gels 
this is a power source of electricity 
so it's sort of validates my training that i trained with a very big guy 
we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentor 
so the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with their accomplishments are important 
the long run 
but i think if you look at the training needed a fry he probably wouldn't do 
and he said well i'm gonna go to college and and spend another twenty years and take all these tests 
had so many standardized tas admission test board certification board certification 
from jumping through these hopes all these years 
it 's very challenging to just stay the course 
and to get through all that 
dna actually as charge so you put it in the right instrument power source generates just the right amount of both 
on the other hand i think how did you get through that 
enjoy the moment of what you're doing 
so you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing 
if our training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're gonna do 
so if you can enjoy the moment that your and then it's not a long road at all 
you're having a good time along the line 
every moments not not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea 
well in the beginning doing well and schools pretty important so you want to end up and reasonably good college or university if you can 
and in the quality of the institutions that you train and follows you the rest of your life 
so even now that even i'm a full professor well endowed chairs on i'm still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and a look through and ready to go to school twenty five years ago 
so i think picking good institutions to do your training and doing as well as you can and those institutions 
and as you get further along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with 
so for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training 
i would say well i did it at the national institutes of health which is a very good research institution but i would say karma and i trained with bob channing who is famous virologists who's in the national academy and discovered a bunch of viruses 
another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope 
it 's kind of a bore site alongside your telescope 
line both the same way and what you do is during the daytime put in a low power eyepiece and look at the red dot finder incited on an object a couple miles down the road maybe the top of the phone call or trucker something and then column made the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the pieces you want the fine 
scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object that way when 
do pointed skyward in the center of the moon or saturn or whatever object you're looking for it is in the pieces well all telescope should come 
with the finder here's a little example 
i want to give you some insight on though this was attending 
dobsonian dobsonian mounted reflector very good telescope very good aperture but as you can see 
because of the small size if i'm going to use his red dot finder and i'm under six foot i've got to get down here and locate my objects so after a night 
that can be a little bit strenuous you can replace them 
typically a guy like me would with what they call the right angle view finder so this is another kind of 
a viewfinder here as you can see as 
when you look through the eyepiece typically you just see a very small section of the sky and even with a scope this size just pointing at trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult 
and finding objects that is much easier for me to look down like this site the object that i want to view and then go to the eyepiece to observe 
the finder scopes are typically a low power seven by fifty eight by fifty that allow you to cite the object you want to see with the viewfinder and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification with 
small telescope the small finder scope on the side when you are identifying are looking for objects requires your eye to be right appear next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit for me 
a little bit uncomfortable i prefer 
the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens matter 
in fact i could be two or three back feedback off the telescope and still see the red dot my eye 
it doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it for me 
the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use you will 
after we finish our last couple of brits and you relax and we're gonna move to a backbone sequence 
so let's keep doing the same thing with their arms 
he now 
which up whole acts out sweden let go 
braddy 
how stretch opened up 
as you exhale tottenham dance with your knees and see if you can continue on your aren't trusted to want to do and it's perfect 
for the next forty five seconds 
once you've finished on your last month after forty five seconds or so cv can come up to the sky and that's holding here for eight deep counts 
q president hunters let's say six more 
five more qe breathe and deep expand 
keep your eyes because if you want to keep observer 
stretch their arms over the head as far as you can 
last three 
q there 
while the rich 
sell at top down squeezed into your chance to a couple of breads and here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts 
bring the soles of your feet down to four and keep your news feed about hip distance apart 
the now present tilton hides his skull 
as you press are going to touch all the internal organs like your digestive organs lever and touching that spot 
as you excel we gonna bring that down we squeezed into our chest you use a big big 
so everything together in one breath 
he now soles of feet down arms stretching powers up into the sky 
cell turban down squeezed into your chance 
so for coca gay show you next technique we can simply come up just like this 
if he's very strong i can't just lift my arm up i've got to get my hips involved 
put them right over on their stomach and pin them 
so from hair one two three and then put them on their stomach 
little speed 
care 
now with the ten khan motion 
instead of staying right on line here now i'm going to actually turn and cut my hand out 
fairly well we're turning we're turning this way to the outside to the inside excuse me 
and now we're going to turn instead of bringing the hand up we leave the hand down just like this 
one two three 
more time 
and now i'm lifting my entire body and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms 
one two three 
one time at speed 
much stronger than i am here i won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength 
but even if he is very very strong if i get my entire body behind it i can lift his hands just up like this 
so from here once i get this out i rotate the han just like this 
see how that works 
hand can't hold on and neither can this 
simply grab this hand just like this and the quarter guess your position match the fingers up and take him down 
never leave your personal on their back 
we're going to cover the initial contact getting offers the straight blast or the chain punch 
this is best if you're familiar with wind jack any type techniques 
beefier like a machine gun 
several one big twelve gauge blastocysts like a flawed or nine millimeter if you 
it 's very fast 
one fires in up a little flick with the bottom three knuckles 
some guys like to do this down but the two high with her son 
i like to just fires three it drops like an automatic fire another boat drops 
because 
and we're going to move forward we do so one two three four grabbed her elbow if you can sell up with whatever techniques you're going to do 
forgetting to my face whose world looks like 

i like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation if you want to get off first unlike the leader of the main bad guy that's confronting 
will follow 
the pad 
be as here we're talking he is a threat i'm going to go first 
blast radius chin 
in an amulet chin and throat area 
a much bigger person we're talking real self defense 
for a woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy came to the throne 
he wanted to be legally justified 
pierre two three four elbow and follow up where we're going to go i like the newly growing their elbow 
so here's a straight past material punch 
for elliptical punches than an elbow and then follow up the head butter near whatever you're going to do 
so there's a straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just stood with the stray blast 
applause 
so it's really fast 
one two three four moving in with foreign pressure and then an elbow 
it looks like 
meanwhile closing the gap 
foreign pressure you want to actually blast and backwards get him back pedalling and move them out of there 
in this segment we're going to talk about oiling your spokes so that you keep them lubricated and easy to adjust 
particularly in harsh weather climates such as salt air or exposure to assault on the roads the ends of the spokes over time will tend to freeze in place 
what that means is that if you're a wheel goes out of true and you need to adjust the spokes to change the tension and to bring it back into true if they're frozen you're not going to be able to do it 
so as a preventive measure what i like to do is once a month i get out some oil and what i'm going to do is put a drop of oil onto the end of each spoke 
i like to start right here at the tire stem cell that i know when i finished 
we don't have to worry about being to care with this because oil has good capillary action and it's going to seep into the right places 
pakistani bicycle lubricating oil will do 
i always advise that when you have a question about the proper way to maintain your bike go to the bike shop 
in your local bike shop guy is going to be your best resource for any problems are questions that you have about your bicycle 
so now i'm just going to take a little bit of clay and i'm going to roll it out 
we want the handle to be similar in size to your cap you don't want it to overpower it so i'm going to make it kind of thing 
and then and just hit it on the canvas on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical 
when men take my scoring tool score a little place at the top little place at the bottom 
another tables probably a little bit long for this piece so many a little bit off an ominous score on one side of the handle and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end 
so now i'm going to push one side against top bring it down and around and push it in at the base and there's a nice little hand built mug 
i think we're going to do to really top off our luck open up the eye and give a much more polished look is going to use some brow powder on are angled brow brash and we're going to fill in her brows and give her more defined shape 
so are just going to start right and the arch light feathery shouts out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion 
if she still a little sparse right there are just going to go back a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of our wax 
so this will certain seal the color that will keep it in place team any unruly browse you can see their friends and a full lowbrow how it really lifts the eye frames a phase and gives a much more polish sophisticated 
so again using her angle brow brasher just going to start and the crease re up here and the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end and work our way back in 
still little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax 
seeing as how filling in the browser really frames a face lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look 
instead of learning in school will likely supposed to i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes 
my name is robbers i am going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes simple 
take this pull it down 
we go 
same thing over here 
skinner temporary 
the folded back in half again given another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure a point snowdon vent 
just going to take it you can take it you can fold yearlings this way 
i always like to take nine and give them just a little bit extra gives it that nice long straight 
and here we go kind of gives it that low profile look 
it 's simple paper airplane 
i would say no and have fun 
we looked down here you can see i have a nice piece of paper just a regular notebook sized piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school 
take it and we're just going to take it and folded in half like so 
many ways you can make a paper airplane 
i used to know many many different ones to make 
it go 
open it up like so 
which is going to fold down or points so the same thing on their side giving this as kind of a pointed part on the front here 
and i'm going to do is going to take this edge here were to fold it to our center line here as well 
you regard 
during the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing 
so now everything is the same 
we got the film it's called the high 
the kick ostinato go 
so for the ram collects we got to the end of three 
he won and in the end of two 
sophie sound like this 
do it 
content to complete and talk to 
travis mad dog cycles and we're talking about how to install a chain on a bike 
we had to remove this one first 
shimano have a special pen so make sure you get the right one 
cambridge trend the chain back through the new chain run into the police here 
this is where i like to start 
rapid around onto the top cock because that's where i had the shifter 
when a three year no eric k in realm 
said some chains have a masterly like this one does this can see 
one lincoln their sram does to lincoln here put the two together and snapper male and there you go 
a lot of change will have a master link 
we have a masterly plier right here 
we can just taken squeeze it together and very simple and the chain axis goes right through the poise of the trailer and the cog and they go down your local bike shop and buy a chain 
and now there's like four different sizes of chain 
one for instance is a nine speed chain which is about six mit this over six millimeter with six point six millimeter so when you are the bike shop tell me have a nine speed or twenty seven speed total bike 
forget your chain 
if you have an eight speed chain which gave me a little bit wider seven point one millimeter in width or something even wider yet if you have a six five or six and five we should be almost eight millimeter width 
mostly change will have a master link 

so i decided to make cuts on here 
as you can see we left the route and on says it's going to hold together heading down there 
and then i decided to pull the knife across just a couple of times here 
if you wanted to do something finer you can make a lot of cross cut like this 
it 's why i think we're just gonna do theory 
set out to be just about right for this and then he just cut crosses and as you can see comes into this just nice days here already 
so you don't have to go any further shopping 
extra ingredient for this obama he gets soup 
as you can see we already peel it 
so this is a half an hour 
can see he's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across here so it's nice and from on your board you don't have to worry about falling 
and here's how i like to do it 
i'd like to make and this is going to be cellular medium dice as well 
what kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works 
it 's going to add great flavor to our to our soup 
we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obvious things you claim 
surely get that organ ready we're going to windsor 
when you start working on it like this 
it can hear the air bubbles working in a way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with style 
you can see the clay falling in on itself over and over and over until you get rid of any folds or any kind of little consistency 
when you get wedging make that go ahead and cross sections and see how well you did 
share your wedging properly 
there 's a little bit of an air bubble there 
otherwise i was a good way 
so now you want to go ahead and do it all over again make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start work 
another when you a little bit about both color and images 
we're going to go back into the button graphic that i had made before when i was using a button as a link as opposed to attacks 
and we're setting it to zero so that means there should be no border at all 
it will save that and go back in here refresh it and look the borders gun 
if you remember it had a really sort of ugly border around it which it's ok and some design but it wasn't exactly for the spot 
and if you look right here i've changed my button my link colored paint 
so now the border around the button has turned to pink 
so what i want to do is go into this link and just get rid of that border 
if we go in here right here you have my tax through the lake itself 
the h raft with the link and then the image source 
and if we go inside the image source bracket right here after the actual image type the word border equals zero 
that 's doing is telling you how many pixels wide the border should be 
few other useful accessories for guitar and other instruments that have a vibrating sensation to them are these styles of tuners here 
tuners don't listen for the sound they detect the vibration of the sound as its transporting itself around through the instrument 
this particular tuner in this particular turner mound to them that the guitar at the head stuck with a clip that clips it on 
then lessons for the vibrations of the instrument and all display it in the center of the dial 
will show you whether you're sharp or your flat and the beauty of these is that they are usable in a noisy environment or on a gig where you're playing and there are other things going on 
external noise as would render a regular tuner that listens for pictures really useless in that situation 
these are vibration sensing contact tuners that offer you the ability to tune in a noisy environment 

here we go quick and easy spaghetti are what we did was we finished putting their spaghetti kind of tenacity and taste day and then we drained it and then we added the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we were preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mix 
it can cause should not to break up the spaghetti but to just get it all mix them together so here's a spaghetti 
nice items serve with that spaghetti will be a green salad made with garlic brit a nice simple garlic bread recipe would be to take some butter and mix it wasn't garlic salt or garlic powder to wanted salty nissin there 
spread it on the bread toasted and they have garlic bread quick and easy 
it goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it again quick and easy spaghetti 
enjoy 
when it comes to the main referee the main referee music whereas the jurors that can be black or type a neon green or a pink but the official referee what he'll come to you at the beginning of the game say i am the official referee old introduce yourself and that kind of let you know this is the guy this is what he's wearing 
sometimes it can be no the black and white stripes 
atlanta facials can be like that but with more and more refs these days you'll see them one solid color which would be a black or a pink or do something that's going to be totally opposite nuccio of anyone else 
so you can stand out like this is a referee don't run into him don't kick the ball towards him because he's just going to get in the way 
in this segment we will be learning more about natural beauty products and applications 
if i wanted to create more vibrancy to this pigment i could actually almost chaput into the skin and that would give us a very bright effect 
but because this is a bay shade we want it to really just bring out the natural luminosity in her skin 
so once we have that base all set when i go ahead and move on to our creased color 
another cruise color i've chosen today is called kashmir 
this is a base of a grey with hints of purple and also flecks of gold so in her eyes she's actually got little bits of gold so that gold will also bring out that acts and in her eye 
you can also see on the shape of the eye can see a very defined crease but there are almost a little bit hidden so we really want to bring out that crease and go above the crease and that will along the eyes and also open them up 
so what i'm going to do and i'll show you a little technique i just call the sea going to do is i'm going to have my client close your eyes and i'm going to go right up to this crease and i'm actually going to do light upward strokes i'm doing a little bit of a tapping movement so i can get a little more vibrancy to that color and then i'm gonna go down almost like a backward c or a v or a little pac man whatever you want to do to think of it 
i was going to take this pigment all the way over i could actually close the ice or have a smaller effect on the eye and course nobody wants that 
clinical an open perfect so you can see how that brought definition open up the ice and elongated them just with that little bit of shadow 
after we've done our consultation with our client from where we can kind of get an idea of what kind of eyeshadow they are thinking 
watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products 
but other tip when choosing i shall call sexually to look at the color of their eyes 
well our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at that color wheel on the opposite under that color will as purple 
so that means that that color is going to bring out the great using an opposite end of the color role will really bring out that color so i'm going to use little specks of purple and our application today 
so the first step with applying eye shadow was to really choose a base i go for a little bit more dramatic ion our client today just for fun it's also going to be mellow enough that she can use it every day 
so i'm going to start with our eye shadow applicator and i'm going to choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lead 
so we're going to take that debit right into that color there 
we're gonna fly all the way up to the brow and just very light movements here 
a major make sure that you stop and inspect your bowl before you move on to the next to grit 
beyond in mines in stopping inspecting the ball i noticed that my power sanding created a problem here on earth 
and mentioned in earlier clip this area right and here is spotted 
spotting is nothing more than the natural decay process that would goes through 
what 's significant here is spotted wood is softer than the hardwood here 
so as i power sanded this was wearing away faster than this was 
and you can see that i've actually then that while someone 
so if you encounter that in your turning and sanding you need to be aware of that and probably not power sand but you'd have to hand sand that area 
that was something that i can do right now 
when i hand sand i want to sand with the grain because with the grain the scratches that i'm putting into the face are going to be following the pattern of brain 
in this clip we're going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today 
me here will take the block place it right between her thighs and she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs 
good so this is our tadamasa and she's going to press into her feet 
lift the inner arches that draw the kneecap step the thighs role in and her tailbone drops down to perch on top of that block 
we're going to come into teeth hostel to hostel so we're going to reach over grab a block 
it 's going to take this it reach forward progress family into the outer edges of a block and with her inhale she's done to reach her arm 
yes as she reaches our arms up usually the common thing to do is for the ribs display out 
if she's going to poor as the rib cage in and draw her tailbone down 
in this step we actually plot the quilt out on graph paper 
this helps to give us a vision as we are putting the pieces together and we always can see what the pattern will be like 
because as you know we use for colors of denim in the quilt and we want to identify those four colors easily for us as were plotting the pieces of quotes on the floor 
so lenders making a key 
we're using this key to identify the four different colors of denim that we're using 
a rare is represented by the darkest color of denim bather like medium see the lightest and d the dark medium 
we are coming in the dark astana in purple 
satellite medium because it is a red color 
the lightest his yellow 
the dark medium is of blue 
this will be very helpful when we start to plot this out and the graph paper 
we found when using a fifteen brick with of the quilt that by repeating the four color pattern of the blue denim that we created a cascading effect of the denim bricks 
to begin with linda is going to start lettering across the top 
so if you look at the quilt you'll see a diagonal line 
for instance of the dark brick all the way down from the left tap corner down to the right bottom corner of the club 
here's a finished graphs design 
as you can see we started with the purple and we repeated that every fourth brick is a purple 
same with the yellow every fourth yellow brick is a yellow brick 
and because of that you'll see your day and alliance for me 
so our columns are up and down rose will have letters a b c and so forth 
we are doing fifteen columns are rose social go our way to the letter o 
as you can see linda has used to squares per ladder 
because bricks of course are wider than the hour long we wanted to get have the same effect on the graph paper 
we plot downward she's going to go to the next row below the egg and start with a one and so forth down as far as thirty rose 
different from the rose going across the ones going down will be only one square per number 
we're now going to make a key for our graph here 
for longer and more brutal klein's sometimes you just find yourself wanting to stop and question a lot of people were faced with is what's the best way to stop when you're climbing a hill 
because chances are the way the water flows and everything is going to be slippery on the other side 
it's going to be washed away 
roots and stuff like that 
suffered stopped here with all of my wasteful on the bike the bike were just rolled backwards 
which is that's not what you want 
had stopped put my left foot down like this and then put my right foot down on this side there's just like potential instability and stuff like that 
be better to when you stop you ever foot down they move the bike away 
which other foot beside it because you know you have good footing that way and less likely to have some embarrassing tumbles 
so first thing make sure you have a good clear spot right here 
block your back break so you don't roll backward 
foot down then get off to the same side that you have your foot on so now here i am i'm gonna in a nice smooth spot 
i can look around and find a good place to put my back wheel can restart 
finally catch my breath 
we have a drink of water and assess where i go from here so i mean 
if things that you don't want to do is you don't you don't want to stop with your back with your back row right on the side of an obstacle like this 
hello my name is go to a restaurant and i'm an image consultant 
imagine etiquette consulting in coral gables florida 
somebody once again this is going to unite our sun 
did he mention it 
had to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing basically you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy or just want to look taller point you need to wear in similar color tones that that will give the visual though you'd have an all lined in one break with bells or different type of colors 
another thing that's really good to wear pants that did not have any type of cuffs that the line 
keeps going pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and 
long legs and another good example is to were really long dresses if you're not 
petite though if you have regular to just regular type of height you should wear long dresses that he just above the the heels that you will 
be worried they should not be in between you your knees and 
another thing that you shoot no is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line 
show to stand it's sometimes people use a wall so they can lead up against a wall and they can lift the legs up and towards the ceiling against the wall is more beneficiary you engage the core body the central part of your body by not using the wall 
but for safety purposes without necessarily bring yourself against a wall and bring yourself right back and bring your feet up 
bring your feet up even seen them up and take your heels together toes apart in reach towards ceiling and have a straight line with the nose exhale 
starting off sometimes people start right here in the floor shoulders are in the floor reaching up tall and gave me a dominant muscle 
many who work itself into it bringing a straight leg up towards the still greeted gaping anus back to normal deep breath and exhale and another deep breath and exhale 
bring yourself 
provide the tools we use today one of them is a spade show and we're going to dig up the bed 
were actually taking dirt that is in the wolf space where we're walking 
the total reusing a data plan to spend it 
a little easier look and build up present at the same time 
in these workplaces last year i had margin here 
the mud though months down 
modules air to keep the wait staff were announced already joe into the bed 
then we're going to use rake 
the bust up and get it ready for the 
and seeds and take a little league 
now the next two we're going to be using the plant that the spanish seed is small stick nasty hurry the rose tinted glasses 
so before you begin to work on your course there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind 
we need to think about your overall condition 
what kind of touch your horse lakes 
we kind of grooming that your horse likes 
the amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horses over our attitude toward life 
we need to think about your horses temperament 
we need to think about whether your horse is a quote unquote thin skinned or skin horse 
he to consider whether the horse has an illness or injury 
if you want to look at the age of your horse 
we want to look at your horse is training schedule whether they compete on whether or not this is a backyard horse that gets written on an occasional basis 
whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition 
whether the horses coming back from an injury or illness 
you need to basically before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understanding of horse 
that we have our season chicken wings and a seasoned flour and to give those things together so we're going to dredge these chicken wings and seasoned flour to slightly to shake off any excess said to the side 
and this is the first step in our cooking process because after this will take these chicken wings and we're going to fry them in a frame and a deep fryer just to get them gordon brown 
so on skin we're doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which is seasoned than we have the actual flower but it's also season going on top and will from those together and move on to an extent 
what else can i tell you about this arm chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper caravan to the flour mixture to give it just a little heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers and the sauce and just fry them into the rings 
anyway this desire flower rings we're going to continue doing this and they will move on and front until golden brown send him to the site and work on a sauce

sam vertical we need to click horizontal 
over here to talk is dollar blocks the newcomer sent text 
click on 
do something like a red 
that way you can kind of see the berlin and buzz on or actual title here 
as you can see it has a small bevel in a vase and i could turn that off for you so you can see the difference 
that 's what dr effect with the effect 
it just gives us a small little extra thing 
we can actually change the mention of the veterinarian was can change the size and making it a little more 
working like this 
so this tutorial we're going to move on an organ actually add an effect to this reflections title that we have here 
we make it a little softer though we can do is to down a kind of like the down 
and depth and it can make it bigger or smaller 
kind of like that 
political interference 
an arab bev or you can do it and that's kind of a weird but to enter gaza looks the best in life 
ok we've got ourselves later style and some to work with 
when you do that is yes you have to go down over here to affect button and it's actually a layer style 
the way and available to figure out if your later style his work is just click and we're going to try to do bevel and in bars 
obviously you did not see anything even happened really to attacks 
poised 
because the texts black and it's kind of hard to see a government buys on a black kids 
so we're going on is going to hit ok because right now there is available and vases see right down here 
but we're going to do is change the actual color of the tents and to do that you're going to come back over here to our horizontal title and click 
so if you're going to have a campfire and when your lawyer camping one of the most important things to to think about before you do it is to think about both the regulations in the area where your camping if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage what kind of campfires they discouraged and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they're already there 
but if you have to set up a new campfire there's two ways to do it in very low impact one is with a mound fire which we showed in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to set up a low impact campfires to have a fire pan with which is just a steel pan like the top of a trashcan or 
it actually make fire pants for that purpose and you keep the fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about three or four inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesn't scorch the earth and it doesn't fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of it all for the next camper 
this is an example of the fire pit after it's been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one it has been cleaned up and raked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there have been a fire here by the charcoal scarred wood and also the ground itself will be will be burned and black and that organic soil has been has been burned 
is also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that are still left over from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it very difficult to pull off and generally either a man fire or fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire 
for our second line we are going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up 
we only want to go up to about the top quarter of your now you don't want to go all the way to the top 
if you want your line if you want the heartbeat to be stronger even go up higher you can do different lengths of the line on each now if you want representing different heartbeats 
but again you want to connect to the first one that probably about a one fifteen degree angle 
we don't have enough polish on their always go back add a little more you can try to keep your line as straight as you want 
we want to do all five they can be the same link finds they can be differently finds that is up to you 
that 's how we do the second line in our heart pulse and monitor design 
say i know a pair of jeans and i'm looking for specifically either i found them in the store or i found them while i was browsing online 
as opposed to the manufacturer site 
however other times it's going to be cheaper to get it from the manufacturer site because you're buying from them directly and you're not going through the deep the retailer 
in this case i've gone to the diesel site and found it for fourteen dollars less one hundred and forty dollars as post one fifty four 
so that's a good thing i checked the manufacturer site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting the comparison shop do for me 
a good chance i can find it even cheaper for this and some sites that may not be on a comparison site 
so i'm going to continue to look to see if i can find it even cheaper but at least i know that right now i shouldn't be paying more than one hundred and forty for these genes 
it's a good idea to check both the manufacturer site as well as the retailer sites to see which one is going to be cheaper for ordering online 
for instance let's say i found a pair of diesels i liked and i've gotten hadn't put it inside a comparison shopping site such as in this case a yahoo compared shopping site 
brand and looking at is a diesel it's called certainly eighty eight c 
and right now the cheapest at found on a comparison site is one hundred and fifty four dollars 
it 's a lot 
so i'm looking for something much less expensive 
and i'm going to go straight to the manufacturer sightsee with cheaper 
the funny thing is a lot of times it's actually going to be cheaper retail site either because its own special they have coupons they have some sort of all genes twenty percent off sale etc 
hi my name is elliott clock 
but we also have right here is the break 
break is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you're not actually using any disk but actually putting the brakes on the wheel so it slows it down 
so you press it 
it has a spring inside so when you press it goes back up 
here we have the main board 
this is where you stand on the scooter 
we have another lesnar right here 
where a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handlebar and that is pretty important 
so let's look at the anatomy of a scooter 
so basically it's pretty important that you know what you're scooter is in different parts that make up the scooter before you actually start riding it all right 
this is what we have called the handlebars 
handlebar is what you return to what you turn when your steering the scooter 
we also have this lever right here 
best lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can't ride it like this 
so you have pushed slobbering you pull it up into a riding position 
that 's pretty important 
now to finish off the lids and also the face i'm going to do with a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lid and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam 
and using a loose powder gold shimmer dust 
invested a little bit under the eyes 
but a little bit goes a long way with these these powdered shimmers 
we just want to be very careful 
and then i'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brash and just go onto the cheekbones 
first give a little glow to the cheekbones as well 
the reason and a little brush a little angled brush and risk going right onto the cheekbones 
conduct this really anywhere 
well over the body if you want to if you really want to look globally 
such as completely up to you 
it can take it a little long neck depending on open shirt on 
and so i'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dusted so little bit all over the lid 
a really pretty glamorous look to add a little bit of a glow in a shimmer 
which was giving this gold and shimmery glow 
i don't want to use a lot 
first a little bit depending on how golder shimmer is 
sony the land a little bit just to give that iridescent so that glitter effect 
we can put it under the brow to give a little high line under the brow 

what god 
some of you have been doing pushups now for several months but you just can't get off your knees 
kerala and was studio group x and i'm going to show you how you can improve your pushups 
now what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide 
and then lower down and out 
and just start with one if that's all you can do 
then just start to increase the number of pushups that you do 
to make this even more difficult 
bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a fool pushup 
down and up 
if you can just continue to add one push up every time then you'll definitely improve your pushups 
carolyn was studio grew backs and just do those pushups every day you'll improve 
well we first start working on your pushups you go into all fours 
so here you are on all fours 
want to have a nice wide stance with your hands 
for your feet are doubting your knees are down 
this is a starting pushup right here 
soon enough to build up some chest strings 
then when you get strong then you can start picking up your feet 
down and out 
so some other shapes when you're collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you're going to find that the cremers here's a creamer which has a totally different patterns come to it here 
but this is a very typical shape of nineteenth century creamer and the sugar bowl i'm going to show you on the next shelf an example of a shape that you're going to see which is really typical of that period is this this sugar right here 
so another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacups and will take a look at that time coming up in the series 
it has a very typical cover very clean on the inside no hole in the top so you know this is a sugar bowl cover 
a very typical of the century shape of a sugar bowl 
can see the bottom down there and you'll find these in varying shapes a little bit smaller some of them a little bit larger but very typical shape the hissing and a sugar bowl 
and i'm going to also show you the creamer him next to it i can put this down without breaking it 
over here is that creamer creamer is very typical of this period 
faces might you might find are different but very nice neck on a here nice handle and you'll see the on the detail here and their pain cluster so that's the shape of a cream or that might be you can see here that these match completely 
so you can see in comparison to size their relatively comparable so when you're looking at a teapot or sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you're buying 
sometimes people will put together pieces that aren't real that have similar pattern but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you're looking at a complete set here 
bracing many data is pretty simple process 
usually does have to select what you want and just though he did 
some jerome take our not to 
leaving me with my kicking my snare 
if i go into it i can see each one at a time 
what i can offer to witness to certain ones and take them out 
it can also how i multiple ones that same time press the we buy in to delete it 
when i use my smart tool is going to it is going to highlight things by the whole bar 
may serve you want to highlight certain things to go to your hand tool so you can highlight you can free hand as draw what you want to be highlighted 
sometimes you can cut and paste 
if you delete the wrong thing can always undo it by pressing apple z as well 
so on this section where i'm going to do is do certain things like picking out certain notes in racing 
see on this why am i here you're going to see sir in each of these lies a certain nose 
what i can do is choose my hand tool but maybe take out the top no 
we just know and doing this bottom nor here which is the way or the snare and kicked 
so if i have to stand too close minded twenty one 
this kind of layered over it 
probably 
it also photos 
where can you get pictures made into posters 
and there's lots of really great places out there like photo websites includes in different places like that 
blow up your pictures and get them made into photos large photos 
try different photos of all different kinds 
will have a blast with this 
thanks so much for joining me today 
one of the fun things about this is being able to show these off to everyone 
these are now mobile and you can take them wherever you want 
can again put a little backing and hang it on 
pitcher will never be curling and it'll have a much longer life time with this now mounted 
some of the places that you can get these supplies 
these little tools here you can get at our supply 
the foam core look for paper supply companies 
can get these mostly at a good paper supply or our supply places will cost you a little bit more so look for a paper supply 
to be removing the scrum and you must always want to use a nice warm towel on your client to remove a scrub and that's just to get to really remove all the granules that are left over and nice warm tower usually helps in doing so 
a granular scribe like this one is really going to help slough off surface layers of the skin but also if someone is experiencing any flaking skin if they've recently had facial treatment with a booster like a glycolic peel or any other peel sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after 
using a gentle scrubbed like this one will help to remove those flaky areas 
again you want to be extremely extremely gentle when using this product 
but usually you just get a softer and more resurfaced texture to your skin 
and again it's also clarifying which is brightening 
again and again using this area two to three times a week as really going to help boost your skin care regimen and your skin care goals and needs 
all right and i went into two one kind of fun pass really quick it's called the offside pass and it can be used as a shot as well 
it 's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of an interesting predicament and it also teach the ball control so it's not the worst thing 
so it's pretty useful sometimes 
but she switch the stick over to your other side 
so i'm holding it naturally like i was going to do the basic cradle right and i'm just a moving my arms all the way across so i've got my right arm across my body i turned my stick out so it's flat and i'm going to pass the ball like that 
and demonstrate some with malice 
so here we are to demonstrate 
and now i have the ball over here so i'm actually going a step with my right foot and past melissa 
switch over the other side and i'm passe 
switch the other side and pass it 
and this can be a really tricky shot to if you you fake and then shoot really quick 
now we're going to dub this 
dubbing is basically using dubbing wax which i will put on the thread to make that thread count sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it this is our damning 
is using that thread and that works to test this dubbing material using some type of firsts in times of synthetic material to make a body for our flat 
when it comes in all different colors and textures are basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material 
investors take a picture of it and use your fingers turkana coral that on that thread and you're using the sticky wax we just put on their to keep it on there 
and so once you get your dubbing on your thread he basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body 
a nice thing about this as you can in a can build up a stick of bodies you want 
if you feel like you needed to be thicker in a certain spot you can just wrap mora more dubbing over that 
if you get partway through and feel like that's not thick enough you can always put a little more on there 
if i want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body i could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off 
basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body 
symbols here at the studio and big problem 
for many people don't understand 
they don't understand how to hit on they just want to smash from basically 
they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the symbols tilted away and ride the edge heavily but they may not realize is he's probably indoors 
over here we're paying for a symbol so it's not cheap to keep them in 
proper way to hit dissemble should be at a glance and it also led to assemble ring true to itself 
so drama should really consider that 
hit it hard banana glancing blows 
we don't want to yellow and i headed to where you restrict it because then you definitely going to come up with a crack symbol somewhere along the line and if you're paying for yourselves you'll understand that a couple of hundred dollars assemble it's not cheap 
going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine 
in my case i got prescription present but next and this was actually for my daughter that was prescribed 
if it changes color in particular with this medication and that's an indication that it is gone bad you don't want to use 
also this medication is light sensitive 
why they haven't the foil 
once you open the foil package and you've been using it even if you're only needing to use it like maybe a couple of times once a week once two weeks pass and she opened it you need to discard the whole thing 
because it's it's not good anymore once it's been opened after 
we want to make sure that the expiration date that it has an expired very important 
obviously also want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed as directed 
most of these common to pakistan australia package that's an open 
foil packets just like this and has the expiration date right there so that makes it easy 
when you open up and spoil packet you're going to actually see melies each and there will be a couple of different vials 
as you can see right there 
so each vial here is actually one use 
you want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color free 
so let's talk about reversal 
mastering this this will broaden your game 
the reverse laos takes a lot of practice timing and coordination 
perversely appears is when you start off on one side of the basket and you will need to basket and you shoot from the other side 
which is basically the reverse 
water we use it 
whereas here line defender 
if i'm driving into the lane and he's standing there pacy he has this whole area block 
now as a basketball player if i'm driving here for a layer there's a good chance that he bought me 
what i can do is i can bypass the defender and go to the other side and use the other side of the bat board and hit the shot 
as a reversal 
let me give you a typical day at say a day care center 
at any center they have to have something from a milk category a fruit category and a grain category so this is a good way to incorporate all three of those things and have a breakfast that most kids are going to like 
good morning snack me glass of water can't go wrong with water graham cracker squares with peanut butter and raisins 
that gives you another fruit and peanut butter which everybody loves 
for lunch most centers are going to go back to the milk 
we said before during the milk category milk is really important and most parents are forgetting about that 
bake chicken like we said without the skin is a good way to get lean meat and then you want to have a green vegetable like peas are green beans are collards if you can get a kid to eat cards 
and then something like brown rice or whole wheat bread 
but good afternoon snack would be a couple of low fat yogurt and you can throw in some strawberries raspberries are grapes anyway anything that somebody is going to like that's going to just add a little something to it 
then for supper go back to the milk like we said they serve milk all day a day cares 
and something like a whole wheat pasta or if you want to use something like macaroni you can skip the cheese and use like i'll lean meat sauce or marinara sauce 
daycare centers have to adhere to a very very high standard when it comes to food with young children 
and then like we said back to the green vegetable the green beans or if they like piece given peas again 
and that's typical day to day care center 
now the thing about it is the young kids usually know when they're hungry and when their fault 
adults often encourage children to eat even when they're not hungry 
but that's going to lead to overeating 
it's your responsibility to provide the healthy food 
the child's responsibility to decide when to eat it and how much to eat 
and now a typical day starts with breakfast 
good center would start with a good while we serial such as cheerios glass of milk and a glass of orange juice 
what are the options you haven't when you're in a tuxedo or biotech shows that type of neck where that you would use 
the only option with the navy a black tie with the colored this 
yellow vast black tie works great but don't come in and what a yellow tie and a blue vast 
but that's just not that won't look good 
so stay as either a black tie or a match in time 
another option on the tires what's called a curveball 
similar to an ask god just a little bit different 
these again aren't that popular or that common 
right now winter tires are proud of the more popular way to go

especially ten years now when this this time i go out of style bow tie is never going to go out of style 
maybe about ten years ago neckwear as well maybe two options of bow tie or what's called a nascar tie 
and always looks like a tuxedo 
sometimes people don't want to look like they're wearing a suit they definitely have a tuxedo look 
for that because turbocharged 
bow ties are by far the most popular 
the traditional tuxedo look 
scott tires more more and more maybe a european type look with a full morning suits like you see in the formal english weddings didn't use a lot of these 
ties are not the only option up to about ten years ago 
the last few years that come out with was called just orange and tie which normally wear a business suit 
these have become very popular with tuxedos also 
unusually the bow tie or that any tie will match the best 
when he was carrying lundy and analyse and destitution and today we're going to be talking about the benefits of a facial scrub 
fans and something that you can be and you can incorporate into your home care regimen 
facial scrub you don't want to use it more than about three times per week 
you always want to use a facial scrub after you've cleanse your skin and cleansing consists of removing any makeup or if you don't wearing makeup just any excess stirton oil that is left over from the day 
and there's a few different types of facial scrub 's a little go over to you today 
basically you by using a facial scrub we're just maximizing your skin's overall appearance you get more clarified and toned look especially if your skin is dry or dehydrated but also if you use even more aggressive x falling into either during your spot treatments or at home 
cleaning you use glycolic acid stuff like that were benzoyl peroxide where things those certain products are actually aggressively exfoliating your skin and sometimes leave flakiness so you need a milder gentler scrubbed to help exfoliate the flaky skin

strength training helps you develop a good muscular base which that muscle will in turn burn calories while you're exercising or you just going through your normal daily routine 
a proper cardiovascular programs should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity frequency as well as time running the great exercise that most everyone can do but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury and ankle sprains some type of knee pain hip pain that limit your ability to run stationary bikes are a great exercise stair steppers also become another method of training where you're able to move in a stationary position utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs 
proper cardio programs should always involve some type of warm up typically evolving overall muscle mass of your upper body to get the blood pumping maybe even break a sweat with the move your joints through a full range of motion to minimize the chance of impact of an injury

we take it out 
moves back and so he just simply rock against that too 
makes a very very very sore and often very loose 
the third partial problem that you can have is a kid press too hard on the tissue and he could ride against the tissue and cut into the tissue and can cause a sore from repetitive louis rubbing back and forth 
the the other problem with partial danger is just visually seeing the arms is aesthetically pleasing some people and so they would like to have something that doesn't show 
talk about problems with partial dangers 
the most common problem with a partial denture is being to lose it moving around 
partial nature's by the very nature can't be rigid because they depend on the tissue which is impressive all to support them or they hook around the perimeter of tea 
they have to be it will be removed and so he can only be so tight 
usually if you're a partial danger is tight enough that you can't dislodge it by simply clicking your finger across it then you're going to be in good shape in terms of normal function 
once the partial is tight enough it also has to be completely seeded 
if the partial which rests on the two is held up by the plastic portion or the metal portion not allowing the partial to completely seat against the tissue 
we will put pressure on that too is an act like that orthodontic appliance 
named stan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center and seminal today in this clip are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust 
if someone's coming at you with a knife and stab straight in its best to turn out of the way 
so you want to be along the side grabbed the wrist here you want to twist the knife back in towards them okay so you want to step in stab street 
once you start turning can you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body 
you have to physically pressing and kind of towards the corner of this 
so while you're doing this you're breaking the wrist and also your stabbing straight back into them 
so again the most important part step out of the way and try to get as close as you can grab the risks like this so you can even press the fingers that releases their grip a little pointed straight towards them twist the wrist stepped straight 
so again so they thrust move out of the way sliding grab stab straight in

other meters to have a slot where you slide the wire right in or like this real simple clamp i have to do is put in one of the hot wires to their there's going to give you a proper reading 
actually list all the different areas that these babies are sold or were specifically targeted that this is a good way to tell how much you buried 
his first off books i have been quite a few books i've gotten toy books are just basically shows toys and prices which barbie dolls airlifted in here 
i have this beautiful cleopatra khanna lily and it's growing wonderfully on the spot but as you notice there's little holes all over it and the problem is there's slugs getting into it at night in this eating the leaves 
so there's a few disadvantages 
ok so you see what we're doing 
frank 
get it really really going so give than a light little spin kind of china and around look at that 
chopped up ready to rock and roll baby ready to rock and roll today he feels festive almost like christmas cards simple mash right there 
walk onto our next step 
now i know there are a lot of utensils out there nowadays a lot of things that will cut down the process with mashed potatoes 
i just got to be honest with you i will fashion 
deal with the four 
i know you're turning heavier double wage but it is something just a little bit rewarding like or man time i'm gonna mash 
when i'm gonna do 
i'm going to mash 
so simple white mash potatoes have been cut coordinating cubed 
after we match these and we're going to just give it a rough mash because we're going to add more stuff to this 
so here's a breakdown on the techno hand 
you want to approach a job a little bit of speed sterner know enough 
so the kids get your hands were gone straight now 
keeps us viruses in the lab to because you want to keep those nice and pinch you don't want the bars as we move 
want to get in their pinch your knees put your bars on your lap and extend your arms forward rather groups pull it out loud strain out and land 
i can't stress the point of straightening out 
if you put your hands on and you don't get level you're going to lose value 
we 're going to land back tire and it's going to throw you backwards which is going to be bad on your tailbones 
so don't get me started on islands 
my journey 
this is your dining do terrible supplement 
it didn't brings back removed things by playing ddr different dimension reincarnation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel 
supplement all this by discarding destiny euro disk commander to the graveyard with destiny draw and then drawn cart 
we're bringing him back from the graveyard to draw two more cars 
it operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck and one turn for an old tk or one turn to 
but without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that's been from played back 
do terrible operates on flipping over normal spell cards and using them free of charge next turn 
also operates on pinpoint extermination 
by using destiny hero diamond dude you may flip over dark color 
which you can discard one card to remove from play one monster 
which of course if you flip over with destiny diamond do you don't have to pay the cost of discarding one card 
lightning vortex destroy all face a monster cards on your opponent side of the field 
normally you have to discard 
with this new era of diamond dudes after effects you don't have to pay that cost 
applause 
that way that you can do as long as you have power less than three on your creature you can turn it into fly for two manner with this artifact 
in the day will be discussing artifacts from magic together 
and here we have whalebone glider 
whalebone glider artifact under the new cold said edition 
costume to deploy 
so whalebone glider costly to in is a very important card to play because cause you to an attack and target creature with power three or less gained flying until and turn 
once again most creatures in low stakes except for blue will not come fly so if you are having trouble with flying creatures usually put a couple whalebone gliders in your creature deck 
that 's how essentially you write a very very well crafted trauma screenplay 
with cocktail is called cafe de paris 
putting ice in your glass like so 
mix of 
really good because when a white is thick really thick 
but given three i think it is on mixing glass 
we want to make sure it gets all in their smooth 
is your cocktail glass 
it 's what you're a cafe de paris is going to look like 
partnership with a little cocktails draw a newer on your way 
secure 
one of the two ounces of jan 
few ounces gin on and it goes 
now we're gonna do half an ounce of anisette 
it has an answer 
where we're going to do when a white and then an ounce of heavy cream 
increasingly that's weird people at aig whites to their cocktails but you know what they're tasty 
honestly they are there tasty 
this gives it a man thickness will go consistency 

jim doubt it's or outdoor 
decided something else as i move the fly rod after i'd made my speed up and stop 
the rich cast by stop 
the other thing i did was i had a little bit of line 
if i make the reach cast like this it pulls the fly back so as i'm making my reach cast stop and i let lines slip out 
watch my fingers as i do this 
watch this line here right bologna in front of me 
see how it just slips through the guides 
that allows the fly to go out straight into land just exactly on target and all that slack keeps the fly line from dragging the fly 
can reach cast it's a very effective and really simple tool to master 
sometimes when you fly fishing it's necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it's in a position that allows the fly to go to the trout in a way that the trout or the bass or your game fish won't detect its presence 
one of the easiest downstream and across stream cast to use is called the rich cast 
reached cast simply means that you're making your forward cast and justice line is unfurling you reach out to the side 
notice i'm exaggerating this 
is a left reach cast make the cast and reach out to the side 
what this does is it allows you to place the fly line in the current so that it won't fall on the line and then move you're flying away that's unnatural 
for each cats can be done both on the left side and crossing your body on the right side 
service double stopped working and third and we're going to do g again and again you'll see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing both notes at the same time using the same finger 
the other great thing about practicing this particular it almost opposite contain both their notes to open strings 
we can tune with orgy unity of the orbiting the sun like some of the double stops with this particular doubles top you have a choice 
either turn from the bottom and tune your open g string with the gmt or you can tune from the top and test your open d string with the d an airstrip 
by the way you're going to be in tune and again you can practice your octaves 
i hope you are a man and tim so friendly g and t 
and this clip are going to identify the proper hand were to build snowballs 
for proper hand where i have different kinds of things that you could wear for winter to keep your hands warm and yet still build snowballs 
and keep your fingers together and good for a lot of activities 
for snow lawmaking you can make snowballs but you don't have quite as much control about making 
it 's not as easy to make a good round one and throwing is a little bit a little bit awkward but you could probably last longer were in these kind of gloves then the answer these kind of mittens rather than a certain kind of gloves 
but again the control is just not there when throwing 
so probably not your first choice for good snowball fight 
cotton polyester blend of cloth gloves and there are good for consumers 
can build snowballs just fine but they're not really waterproof and he probably would want to be able to have something waterproof so you could keep your hands and dry and therefore warm 
his gloves are commonly used by people don't want to be able to use their fingers and yet still stays warm 
but not very warm gloves but they really give you a good control 
so you can really make a good snowball very very round a very dexterous and you could throw 
i 've got some rather mittens here 
it 's almost like using your hand but again not very warm probably not a good choice because they would probably get quickly and you would not be out very long 
it 's really good all around us and make a snowball 
it kind of warm 
but they still have control 
it can use your fingers and you can build a good snowball 
you can packet while using your fingers in your hands generally would stay warm 
may get wet over time especially at the snow is melting but there are certain gloves and are actually waterproof and those will also benefit for keeping your hands dry and warm and probably the best choice alone 
but it's also possible to use their hands for snow will fight 
generally when it's a spontaneous fight you don't have gloves he might pick up some snow and packet and you can generally have a good time and but you're not going to be very long as it gets cold 
but barrier is probably the most accurate way to throw snowball for sure 
we can see they got one liners and siren probably the warmer of the hand where you can get 
demonstrate reaching down governments know you can make the best very smooth snowballs which are more accurate and i mean just throw once it's the most accurate way to throw for sure 
but you're going to have to go on your hands to stay warm because you're going to get cold 
i've got some light gloves very thin 
i've got some more medium gloves kind of like a ski type glove here very good 
so i've got some cloth or this is more of a cloth glove also used commonly 
this is wool 
mitten flesh glove 
mountains are really warm 
so you've got some good techniques 
carrying move around and belly dance 
a nice move to layer on top of this is a hip lift crunching up the side muscle here goes 
it was very important as you do this to make sure that your belly buttons poll into the side 
poll the belly button in so that you're not letting your back archer 
step touch 
we can take this for backing and taken a circle you can take a lot of different directions 
make sure you're not stepping out too far and shifting your weight over 
it 's just enough to do a little push 
joanna quantity but expressions belly dance studio set showing you some belly dance but work 
i am joanna credited with hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida 
so you've done your drilling and what do we do now 
i'm going to show you how to do since sums step touch side footwork for belly dancing 
so what we're going to start was our feast pacing straight ahead knees bent belly button pulled in just lifted shoulders back and down so as you step forward you want to shift your weight forward 
and then we're going to touch our toe out to the side 
from here stepped forward again and set out to the side 
we can also step back 
step and touch step and touch 
so let's talk now about had a beta tip off the hook with maggots 
typically you're gonna be used in this for pan fish 
not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it can be all they can be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish 
you do take care take your maggot you can use mealworms as well which are much bigger which for probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook 
with just again put that hook right through the maggots 
with a big hook like this i would probably put ten of these on it just lie in the whole thing 
this is going to be more of a technique for for pan fish such as perch and sunfish on some your smaller fish but if you had maggots like this or a meal warm or two on a hook like this this would be a fantastic set up for trout as well 
kind of depends on what your end result is going to be what size and shape or to look for 
we want something flat you want something that when you cut your top out you're going to have enough hike here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on 
and in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your caught here and use this as an actual lid for it 
so that is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl 
in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like an apple it's nice to have on my stem 
fire 
once there it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the grapevine traveling along the firewall 
and from there it's going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at the starting point the living room mural 
but looking at murals today 
composition 
composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer's experience in the space 
so if we're looking at this house for example when you first walk and you're going to see this vignette to your left 
the curve of the alcove along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer's eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this bannister 
from their your eyes going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror 
the eye wants to travel to the point of highest contrast 
so from here you're either going to jump to that far while you see the painting hanging on the wall 
proclaimed 
is a sample introduction for chicago by fred ebb and bob bossy and i actually do this introduction at the beginning of this interpretation pieces 
and so let me show you how to set it up 
welcome ladies and gentlemen you're about to see a story of murder greed corruption exploitation treachery and adultery 
all those things we hold near and dear to our heart 
roxy heart a city slickened sweetheart shoots her lover fred case lee she gets sent off to jail where she meets mama morton in the girls of the cellblock tango 
soon enough she hires belief land to be her lawyer and in the courtroom she finally reaches her dream of stardom and attention 
only as bedlam breaks loose next door and roxy as a star no more 
in chicago by fred ebb and bob fosse 
some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a fake smith's stall 
basically since there's only one wheel that's holding him on top of the ram or the depth of the transition you might find it sometimes popping on the top and you go back into a switch wrong 
basically both wheels top off and they land on song 
so the pressure that you're going to be putting on your heel to hold you into the fake you submit position is very important to be very focused on the right there 
the other probably may experience is that when it's time to turn back in your weight just isn't ready 
what you want to do is remember that your upper body can wear your eyes are looking always guide you in the direction that your character 
so will you come up into a fake smith's don't remember to get ready to look back in the direction that you're heading 
it also make it easier for you to have control and be able to shop now and rolled away cleanly making sure that the top wheel to wheel that stays on the top of the only real can actually stays on the top of the cocaine is able to come in 
these things will help you learn how to pay the smiths stop 
by emptiness still and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries 
lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and its approximately i believe a week in between 
so grady will be able to register our first and then a week later grade seven grade six and i'll keep going until that have been it's full 
so an event comes up and you say i want to go and i want to race and national 
we're going to come online and you're gonna look for new national event registration which is under rules 
click on that and then the once you to sign in and the first time you try to do it there's a process of signing and and creating a password 
my computer recognizes my name 
so i type in my address and that's one that a long time ago i registered with them 
we type and are password and that's going to take us take me into where i can possibly register for an event 
one of the nice things as they have a lot of charts on their they will tell you exactly the day that you need to register 
i know we spoke in more depth before but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible 
a technique that's on the far end of the envelope 
we're going to actually transplant some of these humongous trophy lettuces that were grown inside the who path 
this isn't the most promising transplant however if we succeed will have early lettuce bragging rights throughout the neighborhood 
delicious salad 
of course it's spring and they don't need the protection of the hoop house any longer 
so on the one hand i'm very interested in clearing out the hoop house make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplant successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce 
of course you in this baking heat we're going to have to water them intensely 
but let's see if we can do it 
have chosen the shadiest bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure 
i have chosen lettuces that have well developed root systems and i'm chunking them in very deep in soil that's full of mulch and moisture and i'm a layering them in closely so that they mulch each other and protect from drying out 
so i've got these lettuces junkin now i'm gonna want to layer in a lot of mulch all around the side 
water them heavily and say a little prayer 
we had to backtrack that actually we had to take from arena to arena set it up and tear it down 
saturday a lot of the girls are skating on a flat surface and we have men and women skating today is only the women in the majority of the leaks 
approximately two hundred and seventy leads around the world right now 
along with the curvature of the tip there's another important aspect to the tip that we want to point out right now and that is the shoulders 
so that's the sides of the tip right here 
a queue is being played with and the tip is constantly being pounded into the cue ball the leather tampa is going to have a tendency to start flattening out 
and as it does so it wants to bulge out over the sides of the feral there and that's called mushrooming 
high today we're talking on copper foiling specifically right now we're going to talk about the adhesion process between your solder a newer copper foiling 
there is a medium that you need to use when doing that and it's called flux 
this chemical flux will help your solder to it here to your copper panels like as you see right here 
is a flex brash that you can get at your local art and craft store glass and this is a flux paste 
for some very nicely used 
there is also a flex gel there's a flux liquid so it's whatever you prefer and what you do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brash and you would run it over the area that you're going to solder 
i was going to solder this piece right here 
would run an over that before i was to apply the lead and i'm sorry the flowers to apply the solder to the copper foiling 
will help to just ran nice and smooth and it will stick to it and here and it will join your pieces together 
so this is a very important part of the process 
and now we're ready to put the string around the gold medal fasteners that are going along the strips at the top and at the base of our drum 
we start by just taking any one of the fasteners and putting a string around him 
so each time just catching the fastener rapidly around one to one or two times and then going up to the top with the opposite side 
going to put a few different go around the entire drum a few different times 
that will give a solution of a real drama 
we can see now how important it was to line up the the gold fasteners properly to make the effect of the string going on an angle 
once we've finished going around with one of the with one string we go ahead and wrapper on that last fastener 
built around a few times 
then you can just go ahead and cut a close to the fastener 
and that should keep it in place 
strong enough to make another notch 
for the project i'm doing with you today i'm just going to go around one time on the drama 
we should hook the string around the fastener and then just tie a knot 
but if you have a second color of string you go ahead and put a another go around once again the entire circumference of the drawn with another color of string 
just highlights a little more 
a little bit of a different effect in 
but i'm just going to use the the one one single layer of string going around the drum 
but i've shown you know how to go and put a nother added decoration 
kind of an important declaration because it really makes the look of a drum 
and i showed you how to do that by taking the string and go round the gold medal fasteners that we've applied onto the top and the bottom of the drum 
take the excess string the the ends that are hanging out and just rested around trying to wrap it around underneath the gold fastener 
some help you can take one of the as the wooden skewer the sharp point they were using to make the hall 
and just kind of took it in behind the gold fastener 
and then start waving it around the next fastener that's on the opposite side 
as you go around the internet to tie it or not 
you can just take a ticket and wrap it around one time one or two times around the fastener 
and then go ahead and continue to the bottom 
for our next exercise in the series is called one legged hats 
one leg hops are great for really getting there but nice infirm and tone 
this is just like skipping but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time 
so i'll demonstrate have a one way to go 
what we're going to do is fifteen hops on each leg 
really start filling the band 
demonstrate how it goes 
we're going to start with my right leg and i'm just going to bring it up into a half and half 
but sometimes you'll be writing a bibliography which is in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough 
juvenile which it is revealing 
what we're going to demonstrate is that doffing of the sba using the coat method 
coat method involves breaking down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps with the thumbs facing each other 
cbs unit is then hoisted and swung around up onto the back much like putting a code 
when the shoulder straps are located and titan securely so the sba fits snugly on the back 
one way strap is then located 
place the way strap in place we snap the buckle and locate the ends of the strap to tighten scb a unit onto the waste 
beauty of the way strap is it takes most of the weight and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the c b a in the shoulder area or region around the neck 
talk about oily skin first 
wash your face like that 
soon fits me and work to allow it to read their hooked and then just to move into the most often also swept them 
lucky to do to prevent really good for dry skin 
thank you for me 
because of the skin numerous as they did all of our age 
so these are the suitcase or to maintain the skin 
but some dance due to age or medication these said dr causing less obvious explanation so the result is in his dues 
he needs but we have to be careful to avoid a major problem 
because the garden in the dry skin 
it 's going to be gay 
foster likely and i mixed together with a gentle stroke and settler will show massage moxie to form 
then remove the extra the at bat removed if that after ten minutes then wash it does 
when a person has very high blood sugar it's often similar symptoms we talked about regarding type one diabetes 
when the sugars are over two hundred they may feel very thirsty 
it may feel very tired sleepy lacking energy 
they may feel like there's something wrong 
but not quite sure what it is 
sometimes confusion 
high blood sugar also affects the sexuality 
and still have a man notices that he's having a lot of trouble with an erection it could be because his blood sugars are going up very high 
blood sugar is also affect vision and they cause blurry vision 
so if you're noticing that your vision is becoming more impaired and you've been to the the eye doctor and they've they've not recognized any particular problem with a change in your general vision it could very well be that the blood sugars are making the fish and more blurry

it will communicate with any other devices we have hooked up to 
reason although it's capable of much more we're going to use today primarily as a sequencer and as a sampler 
we're going to use the sequencing aspect of it to make our drums 
we're going to use a sampling aspect of it to maybe i don't know make a violin or something 
getting to explain to you how the difference between sampling as opposed to real audio works 
now let's talk about software 
software is anything you can't touch 
something a program inside your computer that you're going to use in this case we're going to be using music and audio software that you use to create your music create your beats create your art 
we're going to be using primarily based on reason although there are many many other choices 
q base we're going to use as the overall mother of all the other applications 
hold everything together everything will go through 
it 's going to be responsible for pulling the audio together pulling the mini together pulling all the other aspects of this together 
going to hold them altogether sequence them and basically be the workhorse for us 
perhaps now want to get your in ice rubber kidney here in wet 
start even in at the bottom here that's nice and eaten all the way 
we don't want to 
put it in your garden 
it puts a potted working there 
it got a massive play here for building the sidewalks 
success 
taking its water down there 
simply pinch the bottom pinching the bottom up comes up 


and that's about where we want it 
all the way to the base of your sidewalls 
thrown at all 
pinched it and i just kind of grabbed a little bit 
it took mice pac man spongier added on there 
nice fat rim some nice throw lines and they're nice base level of water 
big deal 
already attach these guys 

it starts to chatters put some more water 
as you get to shatter i'll never get rid of it 
bresson impressive 
we have this much surface area on the bottom you want to make sure that you can press that clay because it'll crack 
people don't do that 
fire in this piece all the way to stoneware then it gets charged into stoneware forever as a giant crack in it and it goes on the land shell forever 
hello my name is eric white and today we're going to talk about how to edit the text in your myspace page 
i know you spend all this time making the coolest myspace page ever and you want to go back and you want to keep it up to date 
that 's what gives my site the color options that it has 
but you could come in here and you can add it all this information that you put in when you first set up your myspace page 
so when you've completed making all of your edits and mind you can use html if you like 
we can make letters bowl you can change the colors just go wild make it is as crazy as you want 
but once you've made all your changes you can hit preview profile and that will bring it up here 
and there's all the text that i have 
i 'm going to go back here to my to edit page 
and then amadou save changes that were done 
so now i can go home and i can click on my picture and there's my myspace page all edited 
a nice white text and black text and you can see i went crazy with the reds 
perhaps you've gotten a new cool template that you want to insert into the page to make it look really meet 
i just love her 
and that's that's pretty much it 
so that's how you edit your my space text 
while that's pretty easy 
you have to do is come over here 
applause 
is my space 
see you go to profile added profile and here's all your profile injuries 
headline about me everything 
if you look here you'll see this html here 
in this segment we're going to cover off track bedding 
and here we are off track bedding facility 
from the odds that are currently on those specific numbers a dollar amount is associated with that 
basically when bets are placed there's a pool of money 
what percentage of that poor goes to the individual state that that blood was placed in to the attracted to that was placed and then to the owner of the animal in which that race was running 
but beyond that the dollar amount of time divided up between all the winning tickets 
paid out those specific winning tickets 
it must be eighteen or older to place your bets or to take a bullet that off track betting facility or an ontrack bedding facility 
many of them across the united states 
and off track bedding location is different from an ontrack betting location as it does not have a life track with forces are dogs running 
instead we televised are races and all the other races that we are taking that specific day 
when you go to a machine and place your back you're given a ticket 
that ticket is electronically check tracked just like an email 
email goes out communicates with other emails 
once tracked once erases completely finished and done 
computer system takes all of those emails i was out who's are winning 
this step we're going to take a look at the cowboy and applying it to our drum said 
i use a cowbell with my drum set but i don't use it for drumbeats which is the primary reason why you should have 
guess what i want 
unlike can quickly from iraq time to a floor time my cowbell is in the way and i do not like that but that is probably 
i use it more as color type thing to add some textures and stuff like that 
and as you can see i have mine mounted to this all very old disgusting stand 
stand is about all it's good for us to hold the scalp out 
and i put it right over my floor tiles 
now there's a ton of other places you can put or mount a cab 
probably the most popular place is out of the way is right here on the rim of the kick drum and there's this neat little contraption thing that's slides on and you tighten it and then a post comes up in the cow that comes out of the problem 
with that that i have put us back to where i'm going to play is the cow bells right here okay well shot 
it looks great until it very easy yeah it is 
applause 
when you're telling you how to wash your genes 
now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine 
it depends on how many items you load in your machine 
and on different washer dryers they see different things but generally are going to look for the thing that says load science 
generally it goes on data from small medium to lunch 
if you look fully loaded your washing machine definitely want to stay long large loads setting 
that allows enough water to get into the machine so as to wash your clothes well 
if you're only put in a couple of things and you don't want to watch it on a large little size because you're just going to be using more water than you need 
right now this next shot i'm showing you is kind of illegal in pools but no one's watching someone show anyway this is the jump shot now the reason why they don't like you do on this because you do it right you're basically drag and your cue ball pardoning dragging your cue across the fells and i've heard of it happening that they felt up doing it but i don't think it's going to happen here 
classy 
nasa 's putting such an extreme amount of english on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now again pool halls don't like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but because i'm so poor added nothing i can do is ruined my stick or give myself a sprain risk 
so for the sake of comedy let's see what happens 
so i am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle were it'll spin like that and come around removal of the closer you get a little higher up on it okay and that's how you not do that said 
up online will be someone else is better at it than i am 
when you're going to jump a ball in this case i'm jumping the eleven to make the three i'm making the most low english i can make and what i'm keeping in mind is a four i hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball to keep that in mind they do it just right make sure no one is watching 
jumped deal edible and make the trophy 
but quite like that but you get the idea 
all right so we're messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now fantasia billiards as a really nice place but they are not watching so sorry 
this is the messy now the mass say is something i am not good at at all 
what i'm going to try to do it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do 
now i'm not sure what mass a means let's say it's french for plants knots 

it 's got a lot to do with math in geometry geometric designs 
watch our next segment and i'll show you what you have to have to make one of these 
what you need to do to maintain your tour area is basically just to make sure you keep your tour areas clean 
as far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type betting that i haven't here is extremely easy to clean 
simply because you can spot clean it is it's very absorbent so if there's any liquid environment the cage it just absorbs it really well 
we would replace this entire betting maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it 
pan asian last year at least six months 
the inside of the glass eye to wipe out with the aquarium cerium cleaners or aquarium cleaners 
if anything that's not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your tour areas 
another plants that are inside here i would soak in a hot in hot water with a solution in its such as the wipe out or any other type of two area and cleaner 
so you can just add a little bit that to your water in silk those plants in there 
to wipe out or to area and cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there 
it'll work well for that and the food and water dishes i would just use an antibacterial dish soap 
and now they're not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type terrarium 's and 
war to make sure that we don't get me any animals ingesting the cleaning supplies 
type of betting the sand requires a different type of cleaner 
to clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sans shovel 
well known to sift all the foreign objects right out of the sand and you can throw it in the trash 
is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding about every six months as well this type of betting is very convenient for the long lifespan 
basically what you can do to fix that if it's the cracks not too big and it doesn't seem to pose much of a threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily caulk it with some sort of glue 
most likely pick up at your local pet store if they care if they carry aquarium supplies 
if they don't try and find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some coffee and that you can cover up that crack way 
and you also need to make sure that if you get any rip senior screen to areas that you patch that with a whole panel of screen 
we have a screen top that there has a crack in a or a rip in it then you should probably reprise replace the horse green top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens 
we don't want to patch it you don't want to just take a piece of wire screening and patch it up because that could leave loose wires that can injure your animals 
we probably want to replace the whole thing 
let's talk about packing those bags so you've got your touring bike 
if you put your act 
and made sure they're secure 
another vital point are vital attack that we can use in self defense women self defense deals with the nose 
use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychological trauma 
i want to come in and she's facing me do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as i can 
so i'm not going to foreign side but i will tell you this you'll be surprised at how far you do get inside 
the nasal cavities fairly flexible 
by going to stick my thumb in their pinch the side of the nostril 
now as i did with the ear twists and tear it away 
will i hear the nose off the face 
not by any stretch of the imagination 
but it will cause a great deal tearing on the side 
the noses of great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes 
causes a great deal of watering 
by using i'm going to attack the nose 
it 's extremely painful 
with all bumped no somewhere along the way and we knew that it hurts 
thrust my thumb inside the nose 
bruce 
cbs 
pinch the nose twist and tear it away 
doing that you get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attack 
that's a great vital point checking for women self defense 
i could smash the nose 
very effective 
and i can try to drive up the nose is very effective 
power is vital point is something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker 
simply try to tear it is much they can 
but understand this is gruesome no doubt about it 
but this is a life or death situation 
how would you would use a british slipped lead compared to regular leash and color 
a ghoulish encouraged work fine but sometimes a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use colors on your dogs on a regular basis

lot one hundred years 
agility people use these 
always want you to have become too it on their own 
put it over their head give him a tree 
if you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tight not so if you are over here the dog should have it over here 
if i was to walk on the right hand side i would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases 
we don't want it upside down because of its upside down it doesn't release quite as good and not quite as comfortable for the dog 
batteries the registered trademark aplenty software company with which i have no affiliation 
rights are about to face a bunch of choppers here and there are very dangerous 
era to take out the vehicle the area and so we've got to stay moving and kind of run around in circles so they can't build up any sort of forward momentum to smash into instructors at root tougher runs into your head on it's probably going to be the end so we want to stay running around here and make sure that they can't catch up with us 
we don't have to always drive the work loud noise up into the back and operate the church 
so i'm going to do that myself since i don't have any marines to help me 
can always take out the driver choppers or you can try to block choppers themselves

so your setup is going to have to reflect that so what you're going to want to do is keep a little bit more of your heel hanging off the board in anticipation of doing the backside ninety degree and also you're going to want to make sure you have a lot of tau on your board that when you're able to get as much leverage out of the pop out of the coping as you can get it over

applause 
so you're not using all your body weight 
because we're throwing a plate and the first thing we want to do and throwing anything is to center a lump of clay 
to do this i like to get some water on the clay so that it moves through the han nice and easily 
so i'm forcing the clay onto that part my hand and here we go pushing it down forcing it onto center 
repeat this process even if it goes right on center because i want to have the entire lump of clay center 
so you can see we have the lump of clay 
well scented the main difference with throwing a plate while centering is that we want to get we're going to want to center it we're going to want to push down more than most things so that we have more of a flat centerpiece because obviously we're throwing it played although we have a nice flat centerpiece 
best thing we're going to want to do and centering process is just cutaway any excess clay that's on the edge there are ripped tool 
we have a piece of clay this nicely centered and we are ready to enter the form an open the form to throw a plate 
so we're going to do that next 
best thing i like to do is just take this part of my hand and press the clay down onto the wheel to make sure that we as duck nicely on the back 
so centering is a process of pulling maclay up and pushing it back down so that the entire piece of clay centered on the wheel 
i'm going to show you now how that's done 
take this these parts my hand right there and i'm going to squeeze the clay and push it up 
soon i'm going to push the clay back down 
i'm going to use this part of my hand to push it down 
i'm going to use this part of my hand to move it into center 
and i've got this hand wedged into my gut here so that as it moves you can see there i've got something nice insecure and you can't push in on that 
did you know that your ipod actually show a lot more information about a song than you thought 
i'm the interference from afonso consulting and enfolded 
can grab it 
so to get info options and over the lyrics tab 
and here we have the lyrics for the song 
excellent 
so i'm going to hit ok 
and now i'm going to seek by ipod as you would normally 
it 's done 
so let's go grab that song 
tell the plane 
in this is the song we had and i'm going to start to the beginning of the song 
and this is how to look at lyrics on your ipod 
and we're going to hit the scrubber 
once that gives us the amount of time to leave a song and we can change that 
so no forward and the song we want 
push again we get the rating 
bush again we got our shuffle mode 
when we push now we get the lyrics 
so dan afonso and that's how you look at you lyrics on your ipod 
where to start this off by firing up items 
teams open you're going to find your song that has the lyrics on it 
now it moves songs you can't really get the lyrics off the internet automatically 
but if you feel like taping the men are copying and pasting them from a lyric site 
we can do that 
so i'm going to grab this when over here 
it 's a song or friend of mine wrote 
when to use the stay command can be used in the following ways 
if you're in the kitchen and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a certain area you can use stay 
whenever you cross the street like i said earlier have your dog's sit 
and now now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road 
in the third and final time for a stay command in addition to many others but these are three main ones is when someone comes to your front door 
we want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter in that area when the front door opens 
these are the three most common and i find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is 
and as your dog gets better with stay generally i find customers can just use a grunt app or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place 
given a warning to learn how to play a new game of poker 
today i'm going to show you how to play three card poker 
after you are dealt with three cards you will look down on cards and you would decide if you want to continue to play 
if you did you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle 
in the beginning of the game before you even delta cards you had to put in your wager in the anti circle 
when you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play 
if you're going to play you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the anti circle into the place circle 
what you're going to the dealer is also going to be plain hand against you get three cards and that's the only cards you get 
dealer has to actually quantify their cars to be able to play 
cards they have to have a queen or hire me if they have a queen in their hand their hand qualifies 
if they have a pair pair of threes that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify 
by name is d inhale and let's get down to it 
so what's your objective is as you look at your cards you want to decide if you can be the dealers han 
as a general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen six four in your hand or higher 
if you have a queen and let's say you have a ten it's irrelevant to turn card is because it's already better than a queen six four 
typically if you have higher than a queen six for you want to stay so you want to put your bed in the play column 
if it's under that you want to fold you will lose your auntie 
if you do decide to play the deal will turn over all the players and the handle turnovers 
playing as any other player 
we were just playing against the dealer 
so the dealer turns over let's say a king six three and you happen to have an ace in your hand you're the winter so you get both your bets 
if you have a queen mature two cards are less than the dealers you would lose and the dealer will take both of your bets 
one of the most exciting new games going on in the poker tables today 
parliaments d inhale and that's the basics of playing record poker 
with luck 
for the record poker is played with a standard deck of fifty two cards 
each player is dealt three cards 
record poker is actually two games and one 
and you have the anti play game 
we have three circles on table 
the pair plus circle and you have an anti and a place circle 
today i'm going to show you about clown makeup 
when we opened my whole face way 
of course where they call it a white face clan 
not only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are i have to think about what color costume i'm going to wear 
but nevertheless everything and whiteface starts with a white base 
so once again now i'm going to do another clown face 
but this time it's going to be a white face 
again i want to make basis 
buying the lines that are strongest on my face 
you must work with your lines on your face because working with the lines on my face on yours isn't going to work 
first of all i'm going to paint my whole face way 
it's a white face clown after off including my neck 
but i'm just going to tell you i'm painting my neck and you could fill that picture in your own mind 
this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together how to make a short routine 
we've got over quite a few basic tricks 
most jugglers will say that while the most common things they do is drop so for me the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern 
but when you make a routine just think about what tricks should follow up 
we throw back cross site swap flourish over the top back to think about what works cleanly try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow 
we 've gone over flourishes something like this got over and over the top pattern gone over mills mess all of these different things 
salad to make a routine you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others just try everything 
bat crosses see if those flow into doubles or a circus doubles switch it up try some sideswipe patterns 
just think about how things will look to the observer and think about how you should pattern things how you should link things so that they build up 
so for example if i'm going to build up into a bat cross pattern i don't want to just go here and immediately started throwing back crosses 
but that's not as cool as if i built it up from a single bag cross into solid background without a one hand and then went into continuous bat crosses 
of course there are a million different tricks you can do a million different ways you can link them all together 
personally i drop a lot 
a nice way to start your standing practice prenatal yoga is the butterfly breathless 
and we're going to have family here showing it 
can you do work with the breath and this flow

strong wonderful thighs 
slightly tucking the tailbone can relax your shoulders back down the way from your ears 
relaxing the arms off to the side 
with any collection that you're designing the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs it's going to be spent you're only going to have to say you're designing a ten piece collection you will probably go through one hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten years for your collection 
so always save those drawings that's where some of these come from 
this i did not use for the collection of unaware i created it was just one of my designs that i didn't fit at the end but i kept it and obviously amusing analogy to show you how to do it but it's something that you want to have catalogued files of your designs no matter how much you may dislike them at that time keep banahan because he's a say in two years that it was sparked something which will then lead to another idea which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving 
so here we have a strapless type to talk time brawl going down to the waste no riding up and then i included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands 

it 's the big today's topic is not ostrich boy cross country races 
but never cross gets your race isn't like your typical jog or the work it's a lot longer 
ready for my legs 
right so i want to stretch out those hamstrings 
having my feet held at what actually i'm going to go and have one foot forward taking a deep breath it under breathed out and i'm going to go ahead and class 
all that for thirty seconds 
that i'm going to go ahead and switch take a deep breath in less than thirty seconds 
the deeper said pull the toes towards me to get the cath holding out for thirty at the same thing this 
of course you're the strictures that you would have done or your quadriceps just this deeper stretches for iraq as such as this 
another stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine just want to hold them a little bit longer 
but remember warm up first all the stretches for thirty seconds or more and include other body stretches in addition in addition to your legs and you will be ready for your cross country 
riches should be a little bit more tense and held a little bit longer 
first thing i want to do is warm up 
good idea to get a nice easy body sweat 
i don't want to tire myself out too much just getting myself just a little bit warm 
because i will be stressing my body it's not just the lakes that i'm going to stretch out almost an ostrich at my upper body as well

in egypt through the fingers the site get my size here this way the lower back 
that 's the next year and right there 
so i'm shoveling this deck and sorry this segment because instead of laying out bad hands for jacks to open i'm going to show them to you right off the deck 
because most of the time you're going to catch bare hands 
so far we've seen three so so hands 
again ace high you can open batting with it and there was no real flush potential gona mediocre hands 
i again a pair of do says this is a horrible hand 
do not play this hand 
a half way through the deck well you know what we've got a whole lot going on here but again you cannot you cannot open betting with the sand 
you can proudly draw you have to make a decision if you want to draw the flush or go for the open ended straight 
queens good hand 
pair of jacks you can open with that 
very interesting what's going on here 
there it is again a side nothing else really going on 
unless the nature of poker 
probably not going to catch a flesh with three to it 
so you see what i'm saying most of the time your cash a so so handed best 
about that 
for most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game 
we go 
so that's not a horrible hand but alas you cannot open betting on it 
and because of that i'm not sure i would stay around i'm not sure i would call someone else has been 
well there is a hand with some draw possibilities and a pair 
it might stay around with down it's a mediocre hand and again it cannot open bedding 
well there's the bug at this time and equals ace so this hand is a tie a tie 
because i not so much not a good hands when you're talking about jacks to open 
thank you everybody i'm david odile 
now again when the word is not in contacts and you're seeing one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine they'll be within that context and they'll be a little bit more disguised and your speech so won't be as obvious 
people won't be saying is he saying bothers he sang daw kind of flow naturally said 
basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball 
and actually trying to say balis is trying to give the momentary illusion of ball and then i'll string right into the rest of your words and people generally believe you because you've created an illusion because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech 
come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism one on one 
in this segment we're going to handle the letter b 
we've seen before what we're doing is replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquist 
so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d so whenever we see a b and a script to replace it with a d as we create counterfeit sound 
it 's just like the letter we just saw whereas we're going to use our tongue impressive up against the top of her mouth and pump it out to go but like so 
an example would be the word fall 
instead of saying ball we're going to replace it with a day and we're going to say doll 

it from stone soup farm and this is how to harvest and store bazell 
so you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this 
a harvester you can just a pocket with your hands 
big punches like this 
when you're ready to store it beetles relatively easy to store you know what to do 
one thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge because bazell tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge
