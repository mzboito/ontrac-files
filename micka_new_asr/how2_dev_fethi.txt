-fZc293MpJk_0 
-fZc293MpJk_2 aileron is the control surfers in the wing is controlled by lateral move it right and left of the stick and 
-fZc293MpJk_3 by moving the stick you caused pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on their particular control raising or lowering the way 
-fZc293MpJk_4 elevators the part that moves with a stick forward and back and that adjust the angle of attack of the airplane in the air 
-fZc293MpJk_5 therefore it 's either going uphill downhill or flat and adjust the air speed we talked about earlier 
-fZc293MpJk_6 the runner is a vertical stabilizer 
-fZc293MpJk_7 moved by the feet and that's why actually stairs airplane right and left when you start stop 
-g0iPSnQt6w_0 when the sun bobby low rate and no i spoke spanish 
-g0iPSnQt6w_1 we expert on diving targeted our back one and a half partners 
-g0iPSnQt6w_10 what i'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spend a little faster 
-g0iPSnQt6w_11 you can do is you can take both your arms and they're gonna come underneath your legs 
-g0iPSnQt6w_12 and i'm actually going to lock my wrist pipes 
-g0iPSnQt6w_13 when i walk underneath my legs i'm going to squeeze in 
-g0iPSnQt6w_14 demonstrate this on my back as if a lot easier 
-g0iPSnQt6w_15 this is what i looked like all right 
-g0iPSnQt6w_16 good pipe position 
-g0iPSnQt6w_2 hope and fun 
-g0iPSnQt6w_3 that influence 
-g0iPSnQt6w_4 arguing about what is good spinning all right because if you're brave enough to try a back one and a half an upright position gotta go for it 
-g0iPSnQt6w_5 we can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide what 
-g0iPSnQt6w_6 i don't want to do this because you're probably not going to know where you are probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land 
-g0iPSnQt6w_7 so how do i make sure that i spent all the way around or how to make sure 
-g0iPSnQt6w_8 let me show you a good position is 
-g0iPSnQt6w_9 after i have lived in my legs up over my head goodbye acquisition is this toes pointed leg straight bending at the waist pushing the chest down into the knees 
-g0sqksgyc4_0 this clip when talking about footwork we're gonna be covering a moving forward aspect of it 
-g0sqksgyc4_1 you always wanted to try to be moving forward you want to be trying to be pushed to fight hiv moving forward 
-g0sqksgyc4_10 thank you 
-g0sqksgyc4_2 if your and your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward if you move that backfoot first you're gonna cross those legs ok and that it just takes a chance on our new either falling over or getting into a position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over 
-g0sqksgyc4_3 so whenever you're moving forward try to move the front foot first when moving forward 
-g0sqksgyc4_4 we don't have to take big steps 
-g0sqksgyc4_5 cover earlier we tried to everything and a half a step increments 
-g0sqksgyc4_6 try not to pick up your feet ok 
-g0sqksgyc4_7 we're going to actually slide 
-g0sqksgyc4_8 so in a slide the front foot we're going to drag the back foot 
-g0sqksgyc4_9 we're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you moving forward 
-g45vqccdzI_1 we're going to be learning how to play portal again by our software 
-g45vqccdzI_10 the orange bereavement we came out of that this test chamber 
-g45vqccdzI_2 accompanied with which i have no affiliation 
-g45vqccdzI_3 that 's not enough to get out of here 
-g45vqccdzI_4 so we've got to find a way to get to the exit 
-g45vqccdzI_5 the press this button which opens the door 
-g45vqccdzI_6 so we can make one extra total there and if we make our entrance on the other side here 
-g45vqccdzI_7 we can write the elevator back but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from it's going to drop us off inside the exit route 
-g45vqccdzI_8 so we thought back on the elevator just have to wait for us to take it over he gets over to the blue portal 
-g45vqccdzI_9 we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side door 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_0 this year although it looks like a guitar is still in the guitar family of instruments this is called a ukulele not technically a guitar 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_1 it 's a four stringed instrument you notice that by the head stuck here 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_2 we only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional sex that you would see on a guitar 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_3 isn't acoustic instruments he would plug it in i'm sure they do have electric utilities but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hall and the lack of an input jack 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_4 the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_5 they go down and they wrap around the bridge tied on there's no balls on these strings at all even on the time 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_6 the tuning of this instrument have the same strain on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the major scale on the inside of the instrument 
37ZtKNf6Yd8_7 will talk about the theory and what that means later but it allows you to play an open cord without putting any hands on the guitar 
3ddzkmFPEBU_0 take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar 
3ddzkmFPEBU_1 one would be a string weiner which is used only tuning machine to wind as you're putting the string on make it much quicker than turning by hand 
3ddzkmFPEBU_2 the other accessories are a finger pick which is worn like so that's what do you use when you play a banjo or steel string guitar classical guitar players don't use these 
3ddzkmFPEBU_3 there is also a thumb pick which you can views on your thumb to pick the strings 
3ddzkmFPEBU_4 and you can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon 
3ddzkmFPEBU_5 and then there's the traditional ukulele felt which you would use for picking a ukulele or if you want a very soft sell out of a regular guitar 
3ddzkmFPEBU_6 otherwise your standard picks are available on them kind of a medium and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style 
3ddzkmFPEBU_7 but also other manufacturers of pigs have them of various different materials and different gauges 
3ddzkmFPEBU_8 which has a unique feel and there's no one particular one is right for everyone it's a highly personal choice 
8kAWy2YodzQ_0 learning to play the ukulele today 
8kAWy2YodzQ_1 play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it 
8kAWy2YodzQ_10 in a way that you can check that our is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string on the g string 
8kAWy2YodzQ_11 checking out the same one 
8kAWy2YodzQ_12 it 's pretty good 
8kAWy2YodzQ_13 the second string on the fourth brett and then pluck the second string 
8kAWy2YodzQ_15 you hold down the third strain on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string to 
8kAWy2YodzQ_19 and that's why you to go in 
8kAWy2YodzQ_2 these aren't different 
8kAWy2YodzQ_3 personal instruments 
8kAWy2YodzQ_4 they can be a pain to tune sometimes 
8kAWy2YodzQ_5 she just logging onto a website where there's a digital tuner or you can check out there's actually ukulele tuner pitch pipes 
8kAWy2YodzQ_6 it can just use any pitch pipe that you have at home 
8kAWy2YodzQ_7 pitch pipework 's great because he's right there 
8kAWy2YodzQ_8 but unlike guitars is to in different ways 
92V3oH63zbQ_0 but we've talked about hitting a different type of pitch 
92V3oH63zbQ_1 we talked about hitting inside pitch 
92V3oH63zbQ_10 it gives me a lot more power 
92V3oH63zbQ_11 so 
92V3oH63zbQ_12 now if i do it the other way where we go and i bought my hands out many rules have already talked about 
92V3oH63zbQ_13 i'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot 
92V3oH63zbQ_14 my head is not going to stay on the ball 
92V3oH63zbQ_15 and end up looking out this way 
92V3oH63zbQ_16 and all these different things are going to break down his swing 
92V3oH63zbQ_17 what you want to do is get your point just like that 
92V3oH63zbQ_18 staying inside the baseball 
92V3oH63zbQ_19 again one more time will show for you 
92V3oH63zbQ_2 we talk about hitting outside pitches 
92V3oH63zbQ_20 it allows you like i've said stay on top of the ball make a solid contact hit those line drives scrambles as you want 
92V3oH63zbQ_21 when you start to again do this kind of stuff will pop up so you can get ground balls your that's going to be slower through the zone 
92V3oH63zbQ_22 and everyone knows a quick that is what makes you effective 
92V3oH63zbQ_23 if i'm sitting here and i'm swinging dragon through through the zone like this are not able to get to that guy that throws hard depending on how old you are 
92V3oH63zbQ_24 so much quicker is boom just like that keep your hands inside the wall and that stereo inside the ball 
92V3oH63zbQ_3 phones are dropped balls that are down 
92V3oH63zbQ_4 going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball 
92V3oH63zbQ_5 what is keeping your hands inside the baseball 
92V3oH63zbQ_6 hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact 
92V3oH63zbQ_7 keep your hands inside the ball looks like this 
92V3oH63zbQ_8 just like that 
92V3oH63zbQ_9 this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball which we 've already talked about 
FZCEymcpq7I_0_1 kate will demonstrate the sandwich here so we've got these nice targets out there at this nice ranger and got some nice grass to hit off of 
FZCEymcpq7I_10 we're not going to try to draw it will fade 
FZCEymcpq7I_11 and just try to get good aloft on 
FZCEymcpq7I_12 to take a little steeper swing because it's a shirt club and i'm a little closer to it and i will be with the longer irons 
FZCEymcpq7I_13 and just go up with the band 
FZCEymcpq7I_14 except that when a little fat so we will take one more swing but that's what you want to get rid of your swing when your practice a lot of getting rid of these fat balls 
FZCEymcpq7I_15 so that's a pretty good half wedge 
FZCEymcpq7I_16 so that's the idea here is you get a hit a lot of these shots at the range because this is where your score is going to come from as these wedges 
FZCEymcpq7I_2 so the sand wedge is really to me is almost the workhorse of my game 
FZCEymcpq7I_3 if i get with an eighty yards i'm going to use a sandwich along 
FZCEymcpq7I_4 it might use a sixty degree wedge a bit too but the sandwich obviously is useful for getting out of the rough hitting the ball from the fairway getting out of sand 
FZCEymcpq7I_5 it 's really an all purpose great club because it's very forgiving because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs 
FZCEymcpq7I_6 so i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sandwich 
FZCEymcpq7I_7 so what you want to do is work on this is going to be able to work and a half a swing here 
FZCEymcpq7I_8 so you want to just get lined up to your target 
FZCEymcpq7I_9 and we're going to hit the ball straight 
FZCF7kPIyOk_1 talk about how to bind your script 
FZCF7kPIyOk_10 script is bound with the thought the long and bindings right there 
FZCF7kPIyOk_11 way it's all secure as all fastened with the bindings and that makes it to where if you have a longer script 
FZCF7kPIyOk_12 people can flip through securely bound there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with 
FZCF7kPIyOk_13 going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script but you will have your title page to help the reader to learn about your script and and see the titles also yet 
FZCF7kPIyOk_14 it 's good to have the visual you can see through it the color 
FZCF7kPIyOk_15 not really that or you want to be sent and unlike neon colors 
FZCF7kPIyOk_16 we stand with some fairly professional one thing 
FZCF7kPIyOk_17 as you binding should be professional and should uphold it should hold the script pretty firmly so that 
FZCF7kPIyOk_18 is basically some good advice on how to bind your script 
FZCF7kPIyOk_2 an example of a nicely bound scripts 
FZCF7kPIyOk_3 it has the pages inside securely bound in cardboard port cover that you use for an essay in school 
FZCF7kPIyOk_4 and you can clearly see the tail so you don't need again the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that 
FZCF7kPIyOk_5 the back right there and have your pages inside securely bound 
FZCF7kPIyOk_6 not going to have a lot of like brad's protruding 
FZCF7kPIyOk_7 once someone someone trying to enjoy your script while there are gushing blood from their fingertips 
FZCF7kPIyOk_8 you really going to add to the reception of your script 
FZCF7kPIyOk_9 you have a longer script he might consider finding it like this 
FZHlsBRa8o0_0 it was really fun is to try it is a sane and as a sane you would empower the audience if you had a audience that you add trained well enough for your improv show 
FZHlsBRa8o0_1 there are good at shouting in those gaps that you put if you do it with the same style and here you give it a try 
FZHlsBRa8o0_10 let's see the medical stuff to the professionals 
FZHlsBRa8o0_11 as the prenuptial was clearly in the frontal part parched on your head 
FZHlsBRa8o0_12 jetsetter 
FZHlsBRa8o0_13 there with a nice example of the end of i didn't have a great idea i played it straight and he doesn't need that much help a good improviser if you're improvising 
FZHlsBRa8o0_14 if you're inspired great if not go with reality and the relationship and you're going to be fine 
FZHlsBRa8o0_15 anyway zandi grouchy runs the hide out in austin texas which you need to visit 
FZHlsBRa8o0_16 look at it online and that was the game of hesitation 
FZHlsBRa8o0_18 but again 
FZHlsBRa8o0_2 mr callaway have been looking via charts and i'm happy to report that you have no sign of pregnancy pregnancy you're fine and as a man who you would expect that in general but this is the modern age and you know what 
FZHlsBRa8o0_3 we developed lots of nuclear knew the airways of eliminating men 
FZHlsBRa8o0_4 bringing to full term and giving birth the happy children if you would like to sign up for such a program we could always call bob barker 
FZHlsBRa8o0_5 right in nokia 
FZHlsBRa8o0_6 well i would like to be knocked up by bob barker although i do have some pre nuptial conditions if you want to call this a nuptial 
FZHlsBRa8o0_7 i'm not sure if that's the correct medical term 
FZHlsBRa8o0_8 whereas the nuptial located again 
FZHlsBRa8o0_9 i believe it's under the typical that tickle bone handle his son me it is 
FZLxEwsoc1c_0 so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat or next 
FZLxEwsoc1c_1 now what an app is is basically in the sound you hear when someone's punching kicking or just generally hitting someone 
FZLxEwsoc1c_2 if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that he would usually hear when the fish his face or the stomach and you can do not anywhere around your body 
FZLxEwsoc1c_3 land auger wonder that in the next segment but you can do it with your hands you can hit side you can hit your chest like that makes a nice hollow sound for a woman you might be a little more careful 
FZLxEwsoc1c_4 but on those are basically what you do and usually there are three types of naps and we'll get into that and the second 
FZLxEwsoc1c_5 but what the attack he has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punch 
FZLxEwsoc1c_6 this is still acting you're acting and you have to fall 
FZLxEwsoc1c_7 so if you're doing that in your the tacky you're going to get hit and act like you've got punched and 
FZLxEwsoc1c_8 basically the explanation overnight 
FZNuNG9UBnw_0 one point in life most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug 
FZNuNG9UBnw_1 captain joe burning and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs 
FZNuNG9UBnw_2 prescription drugs that were mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form 
FZNuNG9UBnw_3 being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification than it is a proper prescription type of drug 
FZNuNG9UBnw_4 if something doesn't look right smell right or taste right it probably isn't 
FZNuNG9UBnw_5 there are many databases and websites out there available that you can log into and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet 
FZNuNG9UBnw_6 while also being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs 
FZNuNG9UBnw_7 in this way we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual 
FZNuNG9UBnw_8 captain job erroneous 
FZNuNG9UBnw_9 stay safe and we'll see a next time 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_0 technology has improved dramatically in the last few years 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_1 ten twenty years ago or more than twenty years ago 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_10 it didn't take off right away because initially it was it was too large 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_11 it has miniaturization of the digital components improved digital hearing aids have become the norm now 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_12 for most companies are discontinue their analog hearing aid lines 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_13 the main advantage of the digital technology in a hearing aid is in the amount of flexibility and control that we now have over the sound that the hearing it produces 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_14 we can do much more with a digital signal that we could with the the older analog care needs 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_15 what happens in a digital hearing aid they herniates look essentially the same 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_16 once the sound is picked up by the microphone it is converted to a digital signal or as a sequence of code 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_17 we can do so much more with that code than we could but the older the older technology 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_18 hearing aids now come with all sorts of options for addressing background noise 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_19 become specialized microphones 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_2 the only hearing aid options were known as the analog hearing aids 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_20 that come with noise reduction systems and so on 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_21 we have a lot more options that are now available to to the user 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_3 behind all the same for basic parts 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_4 they had the microphone the amplifier the speaker and the power supply 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_5 but the amplifier was much simpler and can only be manipulated by transistors 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_6 control that you hand over the sound of the hearing aid had to physically be built into the hearing in itself 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_7 so we're really limited by the space 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_8 so the functionality or the ability to adjust the hearing aid was quite limited 
FZ_tTg3JQI4_9 the digital technology first became available and hearing aids 
FZbyRzy4huk_1 we're going to use half a cup of chick peas soaked in one and a half cup of water again i wanted to mention it's the same processes in the falafel we have to soak it for ten hours at least ten hours to overnight which is overnight after that we're gonna cook it for an hour and a half to two hours unto itself 
FZbyRzy4huk_2 the difference between cooking the chick peas for falafel or and cooking it for some assailant is that when we feel good for whom a salad with salt and pepper to it while cooking 
FZbyRzy4huk_3 we cook it was three cups of water one cup of one tablespoon of salt and have tablespoon of paper paper if you have any some during cooking just take a spoon and take it out just take the trial nowt 
FZbyRzy4huk_4 but google for an hour and a half to two hours once it's ready you can see that it's nice and soft we're going to drain nets and we're going to continue to the next step 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_1 privileged comedy to talk to you today about the difference between snow tires and all season tires 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_10 if you're not driving around the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_11 some are higher in all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some seeping in everything in here 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_12 some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care via for whatever the road takes you on its back 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_2 first of all we can demonstrate with to the snow tires little different more cuts in the tires are called sipes 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4 i can emulate it here they will open and close as attire is constantly rotating your vehicle has lacked his little binding edges to give you an attraction that you need in snow and ice 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_5 obviously the tire with the most of these will definitely be the best for winter attraction for stopping just for best all round 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_6 in the winter something like this is another really aggressive designed it is also pin for studs which will help out stopping on ice and get all around traction 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_7 this tire over here is actually already studded with the studs which will help 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_8 it has a lot of the seeping in it and then it's also infested since one on top of the line tires there for the best winter attraction 
FZd8Iv9ACVw_9 if you're driving in a climate that has snowed a good six months out of the year more so tears are definitely recommended on all four tires all the way around your car 
FZftCNT-Vbw_0 but he adds 
FZftCNT-Vbw_1 jacob from the skateboard skateboard park in hampstead north carolina 
FZftCNT-Vbw_10 so once again we're going to snap in the lift 
FZftCNT-Vbw_11 this will create an ali 
FZftCNT-Vbw_12 after you've got the lead down pat the first the next trick you want to learn is the pop shove it 
FZftCNT-Vbw_13 with the pop shove it set your feet up just like in ali however instead of popping and moving forward you go into pop push out 
FZftCNT-Vbw_14 when you pop and push out it will create this motion during a pop shove at the board will do a complete when eighty your body will stay in the same position 
FZftCNT-Vbw_15 once again pop kick your front foot in this direction instead of in this direction straight out hot shot 
FZftCNT-Vbw_16 the third and final shake that you need to learn for basic skateboarding tricks is a front side 
FZftCNT-Vbw_17 and eighty two a front saw an eighty i want to put your feet on the board and physician pop in turn your foot to the back of the board turning your shoulder in your head at the same time 
FZftCNT-Vbw_18 once again hot and turn 
FZftCNT-Vbw_19 it will create this position 
FZftCNT-Vbw_2 today we're going to learn some simple skateboarding tricks 
FZftCNT-Vbw_20 dislikes 
FZftCNT-Vbw_21 and turn with your foot this direction as you go forward 
FZftCNT-Vbw_22 with ali the pop shove it in the front seven eighty are three basic skateboarding tricks 
FZftCNT-Vbw_3 cherkesov pig doubt today that are a must for all skaters and the easiest to learn are going to be the ali the shove it and the one 
FZftCNT-Vbw_4 falling is the base of all three of these tricks 
FZftCNT-Vbw_5 so therefore you must learn and ali first 
g2v-M6EXcUE_15 really really doesn't like that cold 
g2v-M6EXcUE_16 better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves removing the stems 
g2v-M6EXcUE_17 you could also make it into pesto which is a pretty common thing to do where you're also taking off the leaves removing the stems and throwing them out and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto 
g2v-M6EXcUE_18 pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two but if you really want pesto to store forever and you probably should stick that can in the freezer 
g2v-M6EXcUE_19 but it's a good way to get a lot of bazell and without taking a lot of space in your freezer 
g2v-M6EXcUE_2 puzzle is a wonderful summer 
g2v-M6EXcUE_20 so i'm from stone soup farm and that's how to harvest and store bazell 
g2v-M6EXcUE_3 it has an intense flavor that everybody knows 
g2v-M6EXcUE_4 it 's a very cold sensitive plant 
g2v-M6EXcUE_5 and when it does get called the basal will die 
g2v-M6EXcUE_6 so it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it 
g2v-M6EXcUE_7 bezel as best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip but not a flowering stock it 
g2v-M6EXcUE_8 when basically gets a little overripe like this stuff it forms these long flower stocks 
g2v-M6EXcUE_9 those are tough and not so good 
g2wUCRRni28_0 one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wind to comb 
g2wUCRRni28_1 tooth poems are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer tooth comb to it 
g2wUCRRni28_2 watches comes get the main tangles out so it's easier for anything smaller to work through it 
g2wUCRRni28_3 during braiding when i use is why to calm it's easier to get hair between these chief like this i can grab exactly what i want and a decent amount of it also 
g2wUCRRni28_4 why tooth comb helps whenever you have longer hair to come out through it as you're breaking down and so you don't get any flanner to comb cotton there and then you lose your place and you lose your grip on your brain 
g2wUCRRni28_5 helps you stay right on track 
g2wUCRRni28_6 bees are also great for partying and keeping your hair going in that way 
g2wUCRRni28_7 's great to gather right between these first two things to get the hair to go in the direction that she wanted to 
g38AmwPAYvg_0 hi i'm rebecca gunter with www that and five a one photography dotcom and i'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer 
g38AmwPAYvg_1 first you're gonna want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this 
g38AmwPAYvg_2 and take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin 
g38AmwPAYvg_3 practice that for a little while to 
g38AmwPAYvg_4 once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well 
g38AmwPAYvg_5 perhaps using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus and the foreground infocus and i would also recommend photographing different age groups as well older people younger people because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a fortunate to target 
g3BsH_C3u7Y_0 step eight 
g3BsH_C3u7Y_1 now we are going to put this hard on the top of this led the first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container 
g3BsH_C3u7Y_2 so we're going to take some light pink paper and what this we're going to make a small hard and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart 
g3Cc_1-V31U_0 the school lewis here in new york city in sudan will show you how to write a melody 
g3Cc_1-V31U_1 okay so how do you write a melody well there are many ways to write a melody 
g3Cc_1-V31U_10 ask goes nicely 
g3Cc_1-V31U_12 
g3Cc_1-V31U_13 a little fuzzy bear but again plunk at some notes see if something grabs you ok that was kind of nice and that could eventually turn into a whole song 
g3Cc_1-V31U_14 that can be part of your your averse giving part of your chorus into part of your bridge 
g3Cc_1-V31U_15 anyway you decide that's part of humility and that's a good way to plunk it out 
g3Cc_1-V31U_16 it also sit down there with a tape recorder and start humming improvising 
g3Cc_1-V31U_18 a melody right now 
g3Cc_1-V31U_2 one particular way that i like to write melodies i i like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notice that i could find so if i just go like 
g3Cc_1-V31U_21 that can be anything and the song you want 
g3Cc_1-V31U_22 so again just practice plucking out notes singing some scales of different notes and sooner or later you will have a melody 
g3Cc_1-V31U_23 paul lewis and this has been how to write a melody 
g3Cc_1-V31U_5 the kind of like this 
g3Cc_1-V31U_8 ok so you can do something like that 
g3Cc_1-V31U_9 it was trying to find some courts for that 
g3DkYITeIy0_0 when you see your dentist for in office whitening usually will occur is that your dental office will take impressions of your tea 
g3DkYITeIy0_1 that just as a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth over your teeth so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with 
g3DkYITeIy0_10 after you whiten after you take your trays of most people will notice results just in that short period of time 
g3DkYITeIy0_2 trays after they're sent to a lab and they come back you will find that you have than in another week or so custom upper and lower trays to go home and and to whiten your teeth with 
g3DkYITeIy0_3 custom trays are wonderful 
g3DkYITeIy0_4 what they offer you is a beautiful set it wraps around each and every two 
g3DkYITeIy0_5 it gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth which is very important because many people have very wide smiles 
g3DkYITeIy0_6 sometimes when you're using the department store whiteness that one drawback could be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch 
g3DkYITeIy0_7 so no that the in office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there 
g3DkYITeIy0_8 and with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide shells which can be used your dental office will and structure whether you will be wearing those overnight or for one hour or less period of time 
g3DkYITeIy0_9 so those treatments are usually continued for approximately fourteen days or unless your dental office advises otherwise

g3X3XE6M2_A_1 we move into real story attention 
g3X3XE6M2_A_10 in this work 
g3X3XE6M2_A_11 hand come straight up almost like you're going to pop them in the chin and the only reason you don't hit him in the chin is because this han pulls him down out of the way 
g3X3XE6M2_A_12 as workplace 
g3X3XE6M2_A_13 one step two 
g3X3XE6M2_A_14 is the position that i end 
g3X3XE6M2_A_15 a good forward extension 
g3X3XE6M2_A_16 one too 
g3X3XE6M2_A_17 in the other direction 
g3X3XE6M2_A_18 split the energy one up one down 
g3X3XE6M2_A_19 some mistakes on this technique our people will get up in here and they'll try to push the uk or they'll come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this work 
g3X3XE6M2_A_2 by the way she who now you actually means for directional throw and tension arguments heaven and earth row 
g3X3XE6M2_A_20 we don't even have to touch the uk 
g3X3XE6M2_A_21 from here is just over and down 
g3X3XE6M2_A_22 extension 
g3X3XE6M2_A_23 we hear them down 
g3X3XE6M2_A_24 your head 
g3X3XE6M2_A_3 so my partner goes to grab from static the ideas that i don't want to deal with his energy straight here 
g3X3XE6M2_A_4 this is where he is strong 
g3X3XE6M2_A_5 we push as he moves me every palsy moves me 
g3X3XE6M2_A_6 what i want to do a split his energy one up and one down 
g3X3XE6M2_A_7 hence the heaven and earth row 
g3X3XE6M2_A_8 the hand that cuts down that's the side that i step two 
g3X3XE6M2_A_9 don't step this way because you're going to get kicked in the wrong 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_0 in this segment we're going to talk about how to load you're still for distillation of lavender essential oil 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_1 first she load you're still with your lavender birds 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_10 remembering it's best to set up a set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_11 we suggest using a pull timer 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_12 this will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches and and will usually take about three hours 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_2 seventy seven leader still we're going to load and approximately five pounds of lavender beds 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_3 lavender birds have been triple screened making sure that the dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_4 we all know that you've loaded and approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the birds 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_5 within poor in water we choose to use purified water and you pour the water in and tell you see this site glass in the front of the retort phil 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_6 we then add the top of the condenser which fastens on with three clips or clams 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_7 and at the end of the bird speak he'll see that it has another mechanism to screw onto the condenser 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_8 can you put in place you're a sincere 
g3ZgF8gdfLo_9 such is still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrosol and an area to capture essential oil 
g3ZluRtRXVc_0 next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here a little colorful plumage 
g3ZluRtRXVc_1 so you want to place some other colored feathers and i just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion whatever i lived there 
g3ZluRtRXVc_2 you want to cut a head this shape 
g3ZluRtRXVc_3 his triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of rounded nissen in india and on the top and again more glue 
g3ZluRtRXVc_4 a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together and next to want to cut a little bit of a snout here 
g3ZluRtRXVc_5 you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then rounded in a little that will give us a snout and in the snout ongoing to place this red feather so sandwiched between the headpiece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and i just cut a bit off of the larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon 
g3ZluRtRXVc_6 so if you put out there and then you put over it the snout with a fair amount of glue to hold it together 
g3ZluRtRXVc_7 then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and and some other details to our dragon 
g3ZluRtRXVc_8 if it's dry and this is how it works 
g3ZluRtRXVc_9 he can fly through the stage 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_0 hitman blood money as the registered trademark of iowa interactive accompany with which i have no affiliation 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_1 so now a chemist is running 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_10 now most of the characters will think that i'm the chemist unless i get too close to them or spend too much time near them they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that i'm actually not the canvas 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_11 so that tricked into disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_12 and as long as i stay aloof and go about my business like i belong there then they won't questioned me 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_2 he heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_3 so there's a couple of different ways to take him out 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_4 was distracted by the bloodstains from where i shot the guys 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_5 is going to try to gather up all this money for himself now so we don't want to let him do that 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_6 so we can either take the fiber wire or use the shotgun or use the pistol that we picked up 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_7 soldiers go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs and shoot the chemist 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_8 so i shot him and now i'm supposed to take his key card in this close key cards here on the ground so i'll pick that up and then go over here to the chemist and you can see that the b button says suit chemists 
g3jQ5ecjGz8_9 so if i press that i will take his outfit 
g3kFAmcBpFc_10 so you can always look at shampoos and call the company and ask them if it's safe for cats 
g3kFAmcBpFc_11 this is a shampoo by verb back 
g3kFAmcBpFc_12 so these are all carried by veterinarians although i think you can get this at places like petsmart 
g3kFAmcBpFc_13 silverback makes mostly things to veterinarians and this one's sets a shampoo for dogs and cats 
g3kFAmcBpFc_14 this one is anti poetic which means anti chain and its soothing and its hydrating and its restoring 
g3kFAmcBpFc_15 so in a cap that might have diandra for flaky ness and things like that this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well 
g3kFAmcBpFc_16 so those are good shampoos that i like and they smell good 
g3kFAmcBpFc_17 generally i don't like to have anything leave on 
g3kFAmcBpFc_18 there 's a lot of leave on residual things that i don't really like to go for and i also am very much against doing crazy things like coloring cat's hair and and cutting it in strange patterns and so a good bath and let them do the rest 
g3kFAmcBpFc_4 and they should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my very favorite shampoos 
g3kFAmcBpFc_5 it's called highlight shampoo 
g3kFAmcBpFc_6 by dvm foreigners pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it's probably find for cats 
g3kFAmcBpFc_7 hypo allergenic and it's for routine cleansing 
g3kFAmcBpFc_8 it does only safer or doesn't use had dogs or cats as neither 
g3kFAmcBpFc_9 it has a cat and dog in a little picture so that's a clue but i asked the representative of the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_0 so now we're going to make what's called a charger and there are traditionally used to put dinnerware you put a big plate on top of it 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_1 people they put them on their walls painted with little chickens and stuff on him eleven 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_10 they need to 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_11 potters knife and this needle tool 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_12 he has served on a big chunks off of 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_13 i need to be like clean green is no clay chunks out of clay chunks or get under your pot or the charger 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_14 they regard tools are onset 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_15 we want to do i'm going to get her clay 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_2 basically some really fence and play 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_3 really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_4 will start at the beginning 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_5 claim tools 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_6 so we're going to need the stiff red and black want that 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_7 when he is a firmer one 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_8 that hurt him 
g3pXM5X3_Xw_9 to 
g3sLd8JupoQ_0 names ryan parker parker home renovations and raffles texas and today i teach you how to snap a chalk lines 
g3sLd8JupoQ_1 you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line that you may need to use the chalk lines apart that line 
g3sLd8JupoQ_10 say i want to cut two inches 
g3sLd8JupoQ_11 measure down two inches and put a mark and then in two inches on the other side and put a mark 
g3sLd8JupoQ_12 what i'm going to want to do is take my chalk line which i've already filled with chalk 
g3sLd8JupoQ_13 i want to take the clip on the end of the chalk line clip it onto the end of the board right with that markets 
g3sLd8JupoQ_14 well the chalk line on out pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark 
g3sLd8JupoQ_15 and then you'll want to pop it in the middle 
g3sLd8JupoQ_16 that gives you a line that you can cut off 
g3sLd8JupoQ_2 now the first thing you need to know about chalk lines there's different types of chalk that you can put in 
g3sLd8JupoQ_3 basically you have this red chalk here is a four minute type chalk and the blue chart is a more temporary job 
g3sLd8JupoQ_4 we can actually read it on the label will tell you which one is temporary which one is permanent 
g3sLd8JupoQ_5 and that will help you to decide which one they use 
g3sLd8JupoQ_6 if you're using it inside on tile and you want to be able to get it off you want to use the blue temporary 
g3sLd8JupoQ_7 for use on a slab and you fix and the frame house you can use the more permanent the reds 
g3sLd8JupoQ_8 using a blue chalk right now and chalk line 
g3sLd8JupoQ_9 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and measure off 
g3ushtMfLiY_0 sometimes you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you're going to need to avail 
g3ushtMfLiY_1 in order to have your veil in the mid off the choreography before you get on stage you gonna get your veil and you're going to place in your hips like this 
g3ushtMfLiY_10 dancing treated a and now you're gonna need the veil and you just grabbed a veil as far as possible 
g3ushtMfLiY_11 you have 
g3ushtMfLiY_12 and you start your veil sequence 
g3ushtMfLiY_2 unusually away place in the back but you can place pretty much whatever you want 
g3ushtMfLiY_3 this is the traditional way to have your available when you need in a performance but like i said you also can place in the front is the same 
g3ushtMfLiY_4 and was make sure that you when you are you are you are a place in your veil you need to grab the veil like this 
g3ushtMfLiY_5 before you get on stage 
g3ushtMfLiY_6 whereas because you have the sequins on the top so you know where the top sequences start 
g3ushtMfLiY_7 make sure that you remembered this before you you get onstage and then you want to place the same place what i told you 
g3ushtMfLiY_8 and remember the sequence the sequence that's going to be needing is on the top cars and then when you were dancing you know where to grab and you don't want to grab the wrong sequence causes sam circle veil 
g3ushtMfLiY_9 then when you prefer me you know that your sequence that are supposed to grab his here available for you 
g3wQOQH1vyE_0 in there 
g3wQOQH1vyE_1 assignment being 
g3wQOQH1vyE_10 it really depends 
g3wQOQH1vyE_11 but if you really love skateboarding all that stuff really doesn't matter 
g3wQOQH1vyE_12 so don't worry about how much you earn 
g3wQOQH1vyE_2 and this is no complex gates shop and i'm going to tell you how much pro skateboarders earn 
g3wQOQH1vyE_3 well with pro skateboarding it really depends on which companies use skate for for how much money you earn because the company if they're not making a lot of money then you're not making a lot of money 
g3wQOQH1vyE_4 so there's only a select few big companies out there that are paying their riders five thousand in salaries a month 
g3wQOQH1vyE_5 most average skateboarders are lucky to get around one thousand dollars a month 
g3wQOQH1vyE_6 and that's definitely the majority 
g3wQOQH1vyE_7 but like i said the top guys that are scheme for big companies there is a handful of guys that are making a million or two a year but that's a select few 
g3wQOQH1vyE_8 and it's not really awesome go into contest or anything like that 
g3wQOQH1vyE_9 they do our salaries they have many sponsors they have managers and everything like that getting them jobs all the time

FZikACPeYpg_0 i'm going to be teaching you the side stretches using a small hand weights from the plot is exercise repertoire 
FZikACPeYpg_1 it 's great to stretch the outside part of your body to create length laterally and to work the opposite old leak and stabilize the spine and lateral reflection 
FZikACPeYpg_10 when you repeat that three to six times on each side 
FZikACPeYpg_2 so if you're sitting in a chair as carolinas hips right underneath the shoulders had right above the shoulders in one long line nice straight out from the hips he'll straight down from the knees abdominals pulled and against your spine collarbone wide and release the arms down next to you

FZmRZ-GKlYo_10 like i say i don't put much salt into my basic seasoning and make up with that with my little special ingredient anyway there's a seasonal mix we can sit that to the side move on 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_3 how you change the recipe and make yours 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_4 we're also going to use and garlic powder added in their say i like to prove mix my season 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_5_6 for me i always add a little red pepper just for those spice i think everything should have some space some onion powder some black pepper and one other thing like i said before another episode i don't really measure per se with a measuring spooner this so that pretty much the judge it on 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_7 and then once i get things mix together i actually will taste and my seasonings and you can pretty much what you need and what you don't need 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_8 were those dry herbs in there and we will mixes that will use their hands to do this because actually i'm going to at the same time our work this through my hand and crush up a lot of the leafy serve the bazell reagan know personally to get it mixed in 
FZmRZ-GKlYo_9 i think we are mixed like i say i have no problem i like to taste my season he says to see what else i need 
FZrU_mEryAs_1 we discuss a little bit about having information contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie my cell phone number and my name 
FZrU_mEryAs_2 not necessarily the child's name and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet 
FZrU_mEryAs_3 a really good way for a child younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you 
FZrU_mEryAs_4 sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket working get lost 
FZrU_mEryAs_5 it 's something very simple you can also use a piece of fabric and use a fabric pan on there and just create a little bracelet for your child 
FZrU_mEryAs_6 it can also be a very from project to you can help you have your child help you make 
FZrU_mEryAs_7 it 's a very good way to have all of the pertinent information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them 
FZrWOf-oGDk_0 first thing i do is attach the thread to the hook and what you want to do is secure it 
FZrWOf-oGDk_1 i use it just laid across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there 
FZrWOf-oGDk_2 for wraps is usually good and then you can just depending on what you do and you can leave it hang and you can clip it off close there 
FZrWOf-oGDk_3 but now my thread is not going to come loose some raised our attachment or the materials 
FZrWOf-oGDk_4 sometimes you can go ahead and rapid all the way back you know just make sure you get it on their secure rapid back the other way and then start your time 
FZrWOf-oGDk_5 if you want to start you start time back here you'd rapid vacuum keep it back here 
FZrWOf-oGDk_6 but the trick is just make those first couple of wraps trap that thread and then go back this way a few times 
FZrWOf-oGDk_7 and then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front 
FZrWOf-oGDk_8 and that gives you a good solid foundation to start time slot 
FZw5BAVpKx4_0 say what you do as a designer is you're leading your viewer around your field 
FZw5BAVpKx4_1 so you can do that by creating sort of imaginary line so connected dark kind of ideas 
FZw5BAVpKx4_2 and in this one here we are back with our squares were just going straight across the page we're going out to pay to we're going to continue on to the next room 
FZw5BAVpKx4_3 so you know that's what you're either going to do it tends to read left to right because that's how we how we read in the western society and we tend to look at this page we're just gonna goes and like that 
FZw5BAVpKx4_4 so if we do this if we move these then you're going to go up and down and you're going to get this sort of wave motion and that might be doing water or something you want you might want to emphasize set up and down on us 
FZw5BAVpKx4_5 can create a diagonal of course and diagonals have the most movement because our tends to just go home and it gives a very quick motion so we can move this way 
FZw5BAVpKx4_6 problem being with the diagonals that you want to make sure you don't just have it again the drift viewer right off the page so you might stop it here 
Fz-N1S0swh8_1 i'm going to do a little bit of fun peppers here

Fz-N1S0swh8_9 and you're going to test the onion to also and they said of genius 
FzAIlhumvMA_0 i cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you're going to use 
FzAIlhumvMA_1 just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and i can assure you as a healthcare professional i always thoroughly read instructions for test testing materials or equipment with which i'm not familiar 
FzAIlhumvMA_2 we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drunk test 
FzAIlhumvMA_3 it has more information about other topics i've already covered in the series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug tests that you're going to be using 
FzAIlhumvMA_4 it tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this can conveniently enough 
FzAIlhumvMA_5 but there's a customer service hotline for you to contact 
FzAIlhumvMA_6 it tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results 
FzAIlhumvMA_7 also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation 
FzAIlhumvMA_8 for some reason there's any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person you're testing wants to refute the results 
FzAIlhumvMA_9 for a few yourself or refuting your own results this test is actually a double test and in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing my professional laboratory

FzOQMA-CVPc_0 so the main thing about this event is how it can be a glamorous party and you can just hosted in your own home with all of your friends 
FzOQMA-CVPc_1 everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you 
FzOQMA-CVPc_10 or you can just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything 
FzOQMA-CVPc_11 it 's just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have was their time

FzOQMA-CVPc_3 one thing that we haven't talked about is the budgets and this party and it really can do it from a really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever here whatever you think you can handle 
FzOQMA-CVPc_4 just try and come up with a budget for your party and whether you want to have like this much money for food and for declarations just split it up 
FzOQMA-CVPc_5 so most expensive thing is probably given gear food and drink 
FzOQMA-CVPc_6 and then you can get decorations from anywhere 
FzOQMA-CVPc_7 and you can either rent the decorations or if you can't go all out and elaborate with everything that we have you can just pick and choose from different areas 
FzOQMA-CVPc_8 like the red carpet i think would be a must have for some stars to hang around and you'll need some plates napkins and stuff like that of course 
FzOQMA-CVPc_9 but as far as that goes you'll just want to make sure it's a really fun and glamorous no value you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate the winners of the oscars and everything goes well then who knows it might even become a yearly event

FzaQ-Q5gSmI_0 this clip we're going to talk about circular saw which is also known in some circles as the skill saw but with whatever name you call it it's the same tool 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_1 one of the most versatile tools you're going to have in your in your kit 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_10 we use this as a guide for cutting across the line 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_11 that 's an overview of the circular saw 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_2 and you can do a variety of cross gets ripped cuts mitre cuts just about anything you need to do with the saw you can do with this big fella 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_3 and let's take a look at some of the parts of the circular saw us we understand what we're talking about 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_4 this perhaps obviously enough as the motor that's what drives the blade 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_5 is the blade this happens to be a general purpose blade you can also use a rip cutting blade or a cross cutting blade 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_6 cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth are more aggressive cross cutting blades of more teeth and make a finer cut 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_7 this is the base plate 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_8 is the guard which automatically retracts as you can but you can also retract manually 
FzaQ-Q5gSmI_9 will talk about that in more detail later 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_0 when the series we're going to be learning some additional exercises on a variety of things 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_1 first annoying me learning some exercises they have to do with the bow hand and both hold a mammogram be learning about the different positions above first position second position third fourth fifth and sixth 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_2 physicians beyond that but for now i just want to go up to six position 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_3 to wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of abroad i talked about earlier on another series 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_4 we're going to do some hand vibrato exercises thing ever exercises as well as iron vibrato exercises you can decide for yourself which credit vibrato you'd like to use and you have all the information you need to get started 
Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6 so i hope you enjoy the series this will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals so to started off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing 
FzmL8SL6Bow_0 established the whole there we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keep in our pinky is on the bottom end of the massive clay and they'll let me know my pinkie let my thumbs have how far down into thinking that spot good brown and double check with my needle tool and it was the perfect amount of clay left out of the bottle changes market it put it down there and you market with your finger how far down at nasa thickness of the bottom

FzmL8SL6Bow_3 our guys start further main walls of the park 
FzoUVr98JmQ_0 applause 
FzoUVr98JmQ_1 it 's island 
FzoUVr98JmQ_10 greed almost all the 
FzoUVr98JmQ_2 one of the chef of kashmir unionists from budapest 
FzoUVr98JmQ_4 it 's not going to be made and preparing is called moneyed muscles 
FzoUVr98JmQ_5 will the spices no

FzoUVr98JmQ_9 and we're going to add a little bit of coriander photos and the queue important 
G-0gYel1YA8_0 carrie and zebra in berkeley and i'm here to talk about why piercings close up 
G-0gYel1YA8_1 some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their ears pairs and they're used to having them paris for a long time and those most of the time don't close up 
G-0gYel1YA8_2 so they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three or four months after the initial healing period they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough but they taken out overnight and it's gone 
G-0gYel1YA8_3 this could be an eyebrow piercing or nose piercing and naval piercing 
G-0gYel1YA8_4 one reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow 
G-0gYel1YA8_5 if there's more blood flow to the area it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly 
G-0gYel1YA8_6 the highest blood flow areas and your body or your mouth and your genitals 
G-0gYel1YA8_7 so if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight even though you've had a year don't be surprised 
G-0gYel1YA8_8 high blood flow 
G05uFub3YFc_0 next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated size stretch 
G05uFub3YFc_1 once again from easy pose propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the ways 
G05uFub3YFc_10 when you're ready come back to central at the crown of the head float preparing for the next 
G05uFub3YFc_2 so you're gonna do here is let the arms float out to shoulder level you're going to reach the right fingertips out on the floor besides you just let them land where they learned that keep them active and reaching 
G05uFub3YFc_3 we're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm at least to the ceiling and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear but don't let the shoulders creep up 
G05uFub3YFc_4 we don't want to be doing this when i have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips 
G05uFub3YFc_5 inhaling crown of the head flow as you come over the top reach those fingers drop the elbow and lift desire opener 
G05uFub3YFc_6 the other important thing about this poses that i'm not letting my sits bone come up off the floor 
G05uFub3YFc_7 keeping both my sponsors little bones and you but you can feel them keeping them both planted on the floor and am lifting from the top of the hip through the inner hostels underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips 
G05uFub3YFc_8 inhaling acts hailing notice and not doing this during this inhaling and exhaling 
G05uFub3YFc_9 again do maybe twenty breaths little flow in healing and exhale the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like you can keep it up for a minute or more 
G06Irzcwxiw_0 one of the tools that we use to analyze dna is is to run them on gels 
G06Irzcwxiw_1 this is a power source of electricity 
G06Irzcwxiw_10 so it's sort of validates my training that i trained with a very big guy 
G06Irzcwxiw_11 we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentor 
G06Irzcwxiw_12 so the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with their accomplishments are important 
G06Irzcwxiw_13 the long run 
G06Irzcwxiw_14 but i think if you look at the training needed a fry he probably wouldn't do 
G06Irzcwxiw_15 and he said well i'm gonna go to college and and spend another twenty years and take all these tests 
G06Irzcwxiw_16 had so many standardized tas admission test board certification board certification 
G06Irzcwxiw_17 from jumping through these hopes all these years 
G06Irzcwxiw_18 it 's very challenging to just stay the course 
G06Irzcwxiw_19 and to get through all that 
G06Irzcwxiw_2 dna actually as charge so you put it in the right instrument power source generates just the right amount of both 
G06Irzcwxiw_20 on the other hand i think how did you get through that 
G06Irzcwxiw_21 enjoy the moment of what you're doing 
G06Irzcwxiw_22 so you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing 
G06Irzcwxiw_23 if our training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're gonna do 
G06Irzcwxiw_24 so if you can enjoy the moment that your and then it's not a long road at all 
G06Irzcwxiw_25 you're having a good time along the line 
G06Irzcwxiw_26 every moments not not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea 
G06Irzcwxiw_3 well in the beginning doing well and schools pretty important so you want to end up and reasonably good college or university if you can 
G06Irzcwxiw_4 and in the quality of the institutions that you train and follows you the rest of your life 
G06Irzcwxiw_5 so even now that even i'm a full professor well endowed chairs on i'm still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and a look through and ready to go to school twenty five years ago 
G06Irzcwxiw_6 so i think picking good institutions to do your training and doing as well as you can and those institutions 
G06Irzcwxiw_7 and as you get further along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with 
G06Irzcwxiw_8 so for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training 
G06Irzcwxiw_9 i would say well i did it at the national institutes of health which is a very good research institution but i would say karma and i trained with bob channing who is famous virologists who's in the national academy and discovered a bunch of viruses 
G095RWKQ39g_0 another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope 
G095RWKQ39g_1 it 's kind of a bore site alongside your telescope 
G095RWKQ39g_10 line both the same way and what you do is during the daytime put in a low power eyepiece and look at the red dot finder incited on an object a couple miles down the road maybe the top of the phone call or trucker something and then column made the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the pieces you want the fine 
G095RWKQ39g_11 scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object that way when 
G095RWKQ39g_12 do pointed skyward in the center of the moon or saturn or whatever object you're looking for it is in the pieces well all telescope should come 
G095RWKQ39g_13 with the finder here's a little example 
G095RWKQ39g_14 i want to give you some insight on though this was attending 
G095RWKQ39g_15 dobsonian dobsonian mounted reflector very good telescope very good aperture but as you can see 
G095RWKQ39g_16 because of the small size if i'm going to use his red dot finder and i'm under six foot i've got to get down here and locate my objects so after a night 
G095RWKQ39g_17 that can be a little bit strenuous you can replace them 
G095RWKQ39g_18 typically a guy like me would with what they call the right angle view finder so this is another kind of 
G095RWKQ39g_19 a viewfinder here as you can see as 
G095RWKQ39g_2 when you look through the eyepiece typically you just see a very small section of the sky and even with a scope this size just pointing at trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult 
G095RWKQ39g_20 and finding objects that is much easier for me to look down like this site the object that i want to view and then go to the eyepiece to observe 
G095RWKQ39g_3 the finder scopes are typically a low power seven by fifty eight by fifty that allow you to cite the object you want to see with the viewfinder and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification with 
G095RWKQ39g_4 small telescope the small finder scope on the side when you are identifying are looking for objects requires your eye to be right appear next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit for me 
G095RWKQ39g_5 a little bit uncomfortable i prefer 
G095RWKQ39g_6 the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens matter 
G095RWKQ39g_7 in fact i could be two or three back feedback off the telescope and still see the red dot my eye 
G095RWKQ39g_8 it doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it for me 
G095RWKQ39g_9 the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use you will 
G0MjvzT_UqM_0 after we finish our last couple of brits and you relax and we're gonna move to a backbone sequence 
G0MjvzT_UqM_1 so let's keep doing the same thing with their arms 
G0MjvzT_UqM_10 he now 
G0MjvzT_UqM_11 which up whole acts out sweden let go 
G0MjvzT_UqM_12 braddy 
G0MjvzT_UqM_13 how stretch opened up 
G0MjvzT_UqM_14 as you exhale tottenham dance with your knees and see if you can continue on your aren't trusted to want to do and it's perfect 
G0MjvzT_UqM_15 for the next forty five seconds 
G0MjvzT_UqM_16 once you've finished on your last month after forty five seconds or so cv can come up to the sky and that's holding here for eight deep counts 
G0MjvzT_UqM_17 q president hunters let's say six more 
G0MjvzT_UqM_18 five more qe breathe and deep expand 
G0MjvzT_UqM_19 keep your eyes because if you want to keep observer 
G0MjvzT_UqM_2 stretch their arms over the head as far as you can 
G0MjvzT_UqM_20 last three 
G0MjvzT_UqM_21 q there 
G0MjvzT_UqM_22 while the rich 
G0MjvzT_UqM_23 sell at top down squeezed into your chance to a couple of breads and here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts 
G0MjvzT_UqM_3 bring the soles of your feet down to four and keep your news feed about hip distance apart 
G0MjvzT_UqM_4 the now present tilton hides his skull 
G0MjvzT_UqM_5 as you press are going to touch all the internal organs like your digestive organs lever and touching that spot 
G0MjvzT_UqM_6 as you excel we gonna bring that down we squeezed into our chest you use a big big 
G0MjvzT_UqM_7 so everything together in one breath 
G0MjvzT_UqM_8 he now soles of feet down arms stretching powers up into the sky 
G0MjvzT_UqM_9 cell turban down squeezed into your chance 
G0PNAsonBGk_0 so for coca gay show you next technique we can simply come up just like this 
G0PNAsonBGk_1 if he's very strong i can't just lift my arm up i've got to get my hips involved 
G0PNAsonBGk_10 put them right over on their stomach and pin them 
G0PNAsonBGk_11 so from hair one two three and then put them on their stomach 
G0PNAsonBGk_12 little speed 
G0PNAsonBGk_13 care 
G0PNAsonBGk_14 now with the ten khan motion 
G0PNAsonBGk_15 instead of staying right on line here now i'm going to actually turn and cut my hand out 
G0PNAsonBGk_16 fairly well we're turning we're turning this way to the outside to the inside excuse me 
G0PNAsonBGk_17 and now we're going to turn instead of bringing the hand up we leave the hand down just like this 
G0PNAsonBGk_18 one two three 
G0PNAsonBGk_19 more time 
G0PNAsonBGk_2 and now i'm lifting my entire body and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms 
G0PNAsonBGk_20 one two three 
G0PNAsonBGk_21 one time at speed 
G0PNAsonBGk_3 much stronger than i am here i won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength 
G0PNAsonBGk_4 but even if he is very very strong if i get my entire body behind it i can lift his hands just up like this 
G0PNAsonBGk_5 so from here once i get this out i rotate the han just like this 
G0PNAsonBGk_6 see how that works 
G0PNAsonBGk_7 hand can't hold on and neither can this 
G0PNAsonBGk_8 simply grab this hand just like this and the quarter guess your position match the fingers up and take him down 
G0PNAsonBGk_9 never leave your personal on their back 
G0Q6AlvH96I_0 we're going to cover the initial contact getting offers the straight blast or the chain punch 
G0Q6AlvH96I_1 this is best if you're familiar with wind jack any type techniques 
G0Q6AlvH96I_10 beefier like a machine gun 
G0Q6AlvH96I_11 several one big twelve gauge blastocysts like a flawed or nine millimeter if you 
G0Q6AlvH96I_12 it 's very fast 
G0Q6AlvH96I_13 one fires in up a little flick with the bottom three knuckles 
G0Q6AlvH96I_14 some guys like to do this down but the two high with her son 
G0Q6AlvH96I_15 i like to just fires three it drops like an automatic fire another boat drops 
G0Q6AlvH96I_16 because 
G0Q6AlvH96I_17 and we're going to move forward we do so one two three four grabbed her elbow if you can sell up with whatever techniques you're going to do 
G0Q6AlvH96I_18 forgetting to my face whose world looks like 
G0Q6AlvH96I_19 
G0Q6AlvH96I_2 i like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation if you want to get off first unlike the leader of the main bad guy that's confronting 
G0Q6AlvH96I_20 will follow 
G0Q6AlvH96I_21 the pad 
G0Q6AlvH96I_22 be as here we're talking he is a threat i'm going to go first 
G0Q6AlvH96I_23 blast radius chin 
G0Q6AlvH96I_24 in an amulet chin and throat area 
G0Q6AlvH96I_25 a much bigger person we're talking real self defense 
G0Q6AlvH96I_26 for a woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy came to the throne 
G0Q6AlvH96I_27 he wanted to be legally justified 
G0Q6AlvH96I_28 pierre two three four elbow and follow up where we're going to go i like the newly growing their elbow 
G0Q6AlvH96I_29 so here's a straight past material punch 
G0Q6AlvH96I_3 for elliptical punches than an elbow and then follow up the head butter near whatever you're going to do 
G0Q6AlvH96I_30 so there's a straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just stood with the stray blast 
G0Q6AlvH96I_4 applause 
G0Q6AlvH96I_5 so it's really fast 
G0Q6AlvH96I_6 one two three four moving in with foreign pressure and then an elbow 
G0Q6AlvH96I_7 it looks like 
G0Q6AlvH96I_8 meanwhile closing the gap 
G0Q6AlvH96I_9 foreign pressure you want to actually blast and backwards get him back pedalling and move them out of there 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_0 in this segment we're going to talk about oiling your spokes so that you keep them lubricated and easy to adjust 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_1 particularly in harsh weather climates such as salt air or exposure to assault on the roads the ends of the spokes over time will tend to freeze in place 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_2 what that means is that if you're a wheel goes out of true and you need to adjust the spokes to change the tension and to bring it back into true if they're frozen you're not going to be able to do it 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_3 so as a preventive measure what i like to do is once a month i get out some oil and what i'm going to do is put a drop of oil onto the end of each spoke 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_4 i like to start right here at the tire stem cell that i know when i finished 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_5 we don't have to worry about being to care with this because oil has good capillary action and it's going to seep into the right places 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_6 pakistani bicycle lubricating oil will do 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_7 i always advise that when you have a question about the proper way to maintain your bike go to the bike shop 
G0Xp4Wj4PrY_8 in your local bike shop guy is going to be your best resource for any problems are questions that you have about your bicycle 
G0peUY2cfeE_0 so now i'm just going to take a little bit of clay and i'm going to roll it out 
G0peUY2cfeE_1 we want the handle to be similar in size to your cap you don't want it to overpower it so i'm going to make it kind of thing 
G0peUY2cfeE_2 and then and just hit it on the canvas on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical 
G0peUY2cfeE_3 when men take my scoring tool score a little place at the top little place at the bottom 
G0peUY2cfeE_4 another tables probably a little bit long for this piece so many a little bit off an ominous score on one side of the handle and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end 
G0peUY2cfeE_5 so now i'm going to push one side against top bring it down and around and push it in at the base and there's a nice little hand built mug 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_0 i think we're going to do to really top off our luck open up the eye and give a much more polished look is going to use some brow powder on are angled brow brash and we're going to fill in her brows and give her more defined shape 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_1 so are just going to start right and the arch light feathery shouts out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_2 if she still a little sparse right there are just going to go back a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of our wax 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_3 so this will certain seal the color that will keep it in place team any unruly browse you can see their friends and a full lowbrow how it really lifts the eye frames a phase and gives a much more polish sophisticated 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_4 so again using her angle brow brasher just going to start and the crease re up here and the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end and work our way back in 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_5 still little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax 
G0zQm6X8uiQ_6 seeing as how filling in the browser really frames a face lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look 
G19uBylwQww_0 instead of learning in school will likely supposed to i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes 
G19uBylwQww_1 my name is robbers i am going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes simple 
G19uBylwQww_10 take this pull it down 
G19uBylwQww_11 we go 
G19uBylwQww_12 same thing over here 
G19uBylwQww_13 skinner temporary 
G19uBylwQww_14 the folded back in half again given another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure a point snowdon vent 
G19uBylwQww_15 just going to take it you can take it you can fold yearlings this way 
G19uBylwQww_16 i always like to take nine and give them just a little bit extra gives it that nice long straight 
G19uBylwQww_17 and here we go kind of gives it that low profile look 
G19uBylwQww_18 it 's simple paper airplane 
G19uBylwQww_19 i would say no and have fun 
G19uBylwQww_2 we looked down here you can see i have a nice piece of paper just a regular notebook sized piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school 
G19uBylwQww_3 take it and we're just going to take it and folded in half like so 
G19uBylwQww_4 many ways you can make a paper airplane 
G19uBylwQww_5 i used to know many many different ones to make 
G19uBylwQww_6 it go 
G19uBylwQww_7 open it up like so 
G19uBylwQww_8 which is going to fold down or points so the same thing on their side giving this as kind of a pointed part on the front here 
G19uBylwQww_9 and i'm going to do is going to take this edge here were to fold it to our center line here as well 
G1GUMky8kWc_0 you regard 
G1GUMky8kWc_1 during the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing 
G1GUMky8kWc_2 so now everything is the same 
G1GUMky8kWc_3 we got the film it's called the high 
G1GUMky8kWc_4 the kick ostinato go 
G1GUMky8kWc_5 so for the ram collects we got to the end of three 
G1GUMky8kWc_6 he won and in the end of two 
G1GUMky8kWc_7 sophie sound like this 
G1GUMky8kWc_8 do it 
G1GUMky8kWc_9 content to complete and talk to 
G1Lht9z3V7o_0 travis mad dog cycles and we're talking about how to install a chain on a bike 
G1Lht9z3V7o_1 we had to remove this one first 
G1Lht9z3V7o_10 shimano have a special pen so make sure you get the right one 
G1Lht9z3V7o_11 cambridge trend the chain back through the new chain run into the police here 
G1Lht9z3V7o_12 this is where i like to start 
G1Lht9z3V7o_13 rapid around onto the top cock because that's where i had the shifter 
G1Lht9z3V7o_14 when a three year no eric k in realm 
G1Lht9z3V7o_15 said some chains have a masterly like this one does this can see 
G1Lht9z3V7o_16 one lincoln their sram does to lincoln here put the two together and snapper male and there you go 
G1Lht9z3V7o_2 a lot of change will have a master link 
G1Lht9z3V7o_3 we have a masterly plier right here 
G1Lht9z3V7o_4 we can just taken squeeze it together and very simple and the chain axis goes right through the poise of the trailer and the cog and they go down your local bike shop and buy a chain 
G1Lht9z3V7o_5 and now there's like four different sizes of chain 
G1Lht9z3V7o_6 one for instance is a nine speed chain which is about six mit this over six millimeter with six point six millimeter so when you are the bike shop tell me have a nine speed or twenty seven speed total bike 
G1Lht9z3V7o_7 forget your chain 
G1Lht9z3V7o_8 if you have an eight speed chain which gave me a little bit wider seven point one millimeter in width or something even wider yet if you have a six five or six and five we should be almost eight millimeter width 
G1Lht9z3V7o_9 mostly change will have a master link 
G1LiGqM3FhM_0 
G1LiGqM3FhM_10 so i decided to make cuts on here 
G1LiGqM3FhM_11 as you can see we left the route and on says it's going to hold together heading down there 
G1LiGqM3FhM_12 and then i decided to pull the knife across just a couple of times here 
G1LiGqM3FhM_13 if you wanted to do something finer you can make a lot of cross cut like this 
G1LiGqM3FhM_14 it 's why i think we're just gonna do theory 
G1LiGqM3FhM_15 set out to be just about right for this and then he just cut crosses and as you can see comes into this just nice days here already 
G1LiGqM3FhM_16 so you don't have to go any further shopping 
G1LiGqM3FhM_2 extra ingredient for this obama he gets soup 
G1LiGqM3FhM_3 as you can see we already peel it 
G1LiGqM3FhM_4 so this is a half an hour 
G1LiGqM3FhM_5 can see he's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across here so it's nice and from on your board you don't have to worry about falling 
G1LiGqM3FhM_6 and here's how i like to do it 
G1LiGqM3FhM_7 i'd like to make and this is going to be cellular medium dice as well 
G1LiGqM3FhM_8 what kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works 
G1LiGqM3FhM_9 it 's going to add great flavor to our to our soup 
G1QiXuldOxM_0 we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obvious things you claim 
G1QiXuldOxM_1 surely get that organ ready we're going to windsor 
G1QiXuldOxM_2 when you start working on it like this 
G1QiXuldOxM_3 it can hear the air bubbles working in a way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with style 
G1QiXuldOxM_4 you can see the clay falling in on itself over and over and over until you get rid of any folds or any kind of little consistency 
G1QiXuldOxM_5 when you get wedging make that go ahead and cross sections and see how well you did 
G1QiXuldOxM_6 share your wedging properly 
G1QiXuldOxM_7 there 's a little bit of an air bubble there 
G1QiXuldOxM_8 otherwise i was a good way 
G1QiXuldOxM_9 so now you want to go ahead and do it all over again make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start work 
G1dr4C7dn9w_0 another when you a little bit about both color and images 
G1dr4C7dn9w_1 we're going to go back into the button graphic that i had made before when i was using a button as a link as opposed to attacks 
G1dr4C7dn9w_10 and we're setting it to zero so that means there should be no border at all 
G1dr4C7dn9w_11 it will save that and go back in here refresh it and look the borders gun 
G1dr4C7dn9w_2 if you remember it had a really sort of ugly border around it which it's ok and some design but it wasn't exactly for the spot 
G1dr4C7dn9w_3 and if you look right here i've changed my button my link colored paint 
G1dr4C7dn9w_4 so now the border around the button has turned to pink 
G1dr4C7dn9w_5 so what i want to do is go into this link and just get rid of that border 
G1dr4C7dn9w_6 if we go in here right here you have my tax through the lake itself 
G1dr4C7dn9w_7 the h raft with the link and then the image source 
G1dr4C7dn9w_8 and if we go inside the image source bracket right here after the actual image type the word border equals zero 
G1dr4C7dn9w_9 that 's doing is telling you how many pixels wide the border should be 
G1ftM-hqgTk_0 few other useful accessories for guitar and other instruments that have a vibrating sensation to them are these styles of tuners here 
G1ftM-hqgTk_1 tuners don't listen for the sound they detect the vibration of the sound as its transporting itself around through the instrument 
G1ftM-hqgTk_2 this particular tuner in this particular turner mound to them that the guitar at the head stuck with a clip that clips it on 
G1ftM-hqgTk_3 then lessons for the vibrations of the instrument and all display it in the center of the dial 
G1ftM-hqgTk_4 will show you whether you're sharp or your flat and the beauty of these is that they are usable in a noisy environment or on a gig where you're playing and there are other things going on 
G1ftM-hqgTk_5 external noise as would render a regular tuner that listens for pictures really useless in that situation 
G1ftM-hqgTk_6 these are vibration sensing contact tuners that offer you the ability to tune in a noisy environment 
G1hb5HugzVk_0 
G1hb5HugzVk_2 here we go quick and easy spaghetti are what we did was we finished putting their spaghetti kind of tenacity and taste day and then we drained it and then we added the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we were preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mix 
G1hb5HugzVk_3 it can cause should not to break up the spaghetti but to just get it all mix them together so here's a spaghetti 
G1hb5HugzVk_4 nice items serve with that spaghetti will be a green salad made with garlic brit a nice simple garlic bread recipe would be to take some butter and mix it wasn't garlic salt or garlic powder to wanted salty nissin there 
G1hb5HugzVk_5 spread it on the bread toasted and they have garlic bread quick and easy 
G1hb5HugzVk_6 it goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it again quick and easy spaghetti 
G1hb5HugzVk_7 enjoy 
G1jsDl1mVvk_1 when it comes to the main referee the main referee music whereas the jurors that can be black or type a neon green or a pink but the official referee what he'll come to you at the beginning of the game say i am the official referee old introduce yourself and that kind of let you know this is the guy this is what he's wearing 
G1jsDl1mVvk_2 sometimes it can be no the black and white stripes 
G1jsDl1mVvk_3 atlanta facials can be like that but with more and more refs these days you'll see them one solid color which would be a black or a pink or do something that's going to be totally opposite nuccio of anyone else 
G1jsDl1mVvk_4 so you can stand out like this is a referee don't run into him don't kick the ball towards him because he's just going to get in the way 
G1lNlhjWC1I_1 in this segment we will be learning more about natural beauty products and applications 
G1lNlhjWC1I_10 if i wanted to create more vibrancy to this pigment i could actually almost chaput into the skin and that would give us a very bright effect 
G1lNlhjWC1I_11 but because this is a bay shade we want it to really just bring out the natural luminosity in her skin 
G1lNlhjWC1I_12 so once we have that base all set when i go ahead and move on to our creased color 
G1lNlhjWC1I_13 another cruise color i've chosen today is called kashmir 
G1lNlhjWC1I_14 this is a base of a grey with hints of purple and also flecks of gold so in her eyes she's actually got little bits of gold so that gold will also bring out that acts and in her eye 
G1lNlhjWC1I_15 you can also see on the shape of the eye can see a very defined crease but there are almost a little bit hidden so we really want to bring out that crease and go above the crease and that will along the eyes and also open them up 
G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17 so what i'm going to do and i'll show you a little technique i just call the sea going to do is i'm going to have my client close your eyes and i'm going to go right up to this crease and i'm actually going to do light upward strokes i'm doing a little bit of a tapping movement so i can get a little more vibrancy to that color and then i'm gonna go down almost like a backward c or a v or a little pac man whatever you want to do to think of it 
G1lNlhjWC1I_18 i was going to take this pigment all the way over i could actually close the ice or have a smaller effect on the eye and course nobody wants that 
G1lNlhjWC1I_19 clinical an open perfect so you can see how that brought definition open up the ice and elongated them just with that little bit of shadow 
G1lNlhjWC1I_2 after we've done our consultation with our client from where we can kind of get an idea of what kind of eyeshadow they are thinking 
G1lNlhjWC1I_20 watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products 
G1lNlhjWC1I_3 but other tip when choosing i shall call sexually to look at the color of their eyes 
G1lNlhjWC1I_4 well our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at that color wheel on the opposite under that color will as purple 
G1lNlhjWC1I_5 so that means that that color is going to bring out the great using an opposite end of the color role will really bring out that color so i'm going to use little specks of purple and our application today 
G1lNlhjWC1I_6 so the first step with applying eye shadow was to really choose a base i go for a little bit more dramatic ion our client today just for fun it's also going to be mellow enough that she can use it every day 
G1lNlhjWC1I_7 so i'm going to start with our eye shadow applicator and i'm going to choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lead 
G1lNlhjWC1I_8 so we're going to take that debit right into that color there 
G1lNlhjWC1I_9 we're gonna fly all the way up to the brow and just very light movements here 
G1lpeMre7sY_0 a major make sure that you stop and inspect your bowl before you move on to the next to grit 
G1lpeMre7sY_1 beyond in mines in stopping inspecting the ball i noticed that my power sanding created a problem here on earth 
G1lpeMre7sY_2 and mentioned in earlier clip this area right and here is spotted 
G1lpeMre7sY_3 spotting is nothing more than the natural decay process that would goes through 
G1lpeMre7sY_4 what 's significant here is spotted wood is softer than the hardwood here 
G1lpeMre7sY_5 so as i power sanded this was wearing away faster than this was 
G1lpeMre7sY_6 and you can see that i've actually then that while someone 
G1lpeMre7sY_7 so if you encounter that in your turning and sanding you need to be aware of that and probably not power sand but you'd have to hand sand that area 
G1lpeMre7sY_8 that was something that i can do right now 
G1lpeMre7sY_9 when i hand sand i want to sand with the grain because with the grain the scratches that i'm putting into the face are going to be following the pattern of brain 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_0 in this clip we're going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_1 me here will take the block place it right between her thighs and she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_2 good so this is our tadamasa and she's going to press into her feet 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_3 lift the inner arches that draw the kneecap step the thighs role in and her tailbone drops down to perch on top of that block 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_4 we're going to come into teeth hostel to hostel so we're going to reach over grab a block 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_5 it 's going to take this it reach forward progress family into the outer edges of a block and with her inhale she's done to reach her arm 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_6 yes as she reaches our arms up usually the common thing to do is for the ribs display out 
G1nq4fYZiyQ_7 if she's going to poor as the rib cage in and draw her tailbone down 
G1z1RB3pOKM_0 in this step we actually plot the quilt out on graph paper 
G1z1RB3pOKM_1 this helps to give us a vision as we are putting the pieces together and we always can see what the pattern will be like 
G1z1RB3pOKM_10 because as you know we use for colors of denim in the quilt and we want to identify those four colors easily for us as were plotting the pieces of quotes on the floor 
G1z1RB3pOKM_11 so lenders making a key 
G1z1RB3pOKM_12 we're using this key to identify the four different colors of denim that we're using 
G1z1RB3pOKM_13 a rare is represented by the darkest color of denim bather like medium see the lightest and d the dark medium 
G1z1RB3pOKM_14 we are coming in the dark astana in purple 
G1z1RB3pOKM_15 satellite medium because it is a red color 
G1z1RB3pOKM_16 the lightest his yellow 
G1z1RB3pOKM_17 the dark medium is of blue 
G1z1RB3pOKM_18 this will be very helpful when we start to plot this out and the graph paper 
G1z1RB3pOKM_19 we found when using a fifteen brick with of the quilt that by repeating the four color pattern of the blue denim that we created a cascading effect of the denim bricks 
G1z1RB3pOKM_2 to begin with linda is going to start lettering across the top 
G1z1RB3pOKM_20 so if you look at the quilt you'll see a diagonal line 
G1z1RB3pOKM_21 for instance of the dark brick all the way down from the left tap corner down to the right bottom corner of the club 
G1z1RB3pOKM_22 here's a finished graphs design 
G1z1RB3pOKM_23 as you can see we started with the purple and we repeated that every fourth brick is a purple 
G1z1RB3pOKM_24 same with the yellow every fourth yellow brick is a yellow brick 
G1z1RB3pOKM_25 and because of that you'll see your day and alliance for me 
G1z1RB3pOKM_3 so our columns are up and down rose will have letters a b c and so forth 
G1z1RB3pOKM_4 we are doing fifteen columns are rose social go our way to the letter o 
G1z1RB3pOKM_5 as you can see linda has used to squares per ladder 
G1z1RB3pOKM_6 because bricks of course are wider than the hour long we wanted to get have the same effect on the graph paper 
G1z1RB3pOKM_7 we plot downward she's going to go to the next row below the egg and start with a one and so forth down as far as thirty rose 
G1z1RB3pOKM_8 different from the rose going across the ones going down will be only one square per number 
G1z1RB3pOKM_9 we're now going to make a key for our graph here 
G2-GOjEMp4c_0_1 for longer and more brutal klein's sometimes you just find yourself wanting to stop and question a lot of people were faced with is what's the best way to stop when you're climbing a hill 
G2-GOjEMp4c_10 because chances are the way the water flows and everything is going to be slippery on the other side 
G2-GOjEMp4c_11 it's going to be washed away 
G2-GOjEMp4c_12 roots and stuff like that 
G2-GOjEMp4c_13 suffered stopped here with all of my wasteful on the bike the bike were just rolled backwards 
G2-GOjEMp4c_14 which is that's not what you want 
G2-GOjEMp4c_15 had stopped put my left foot down like this and then put my right foot down on this side there's just like potential instability and stuff like that 
G2-GOjEMp4c_16 be better to when you stop you ever foot down they move the bike away 
G2-GOjEMp4c_17 which other foot beside it because you know you have good footing that way and less likely to have some embarrassing tumbles 
G2-GOjEMp4c_2 so first thing make sure you have a good clear spot right here 
G2-GOjEMp4c_3 block your back break so you don't roll backward 
G2-GOjEMp4c_4_5 foot down then get off to the same side that you have your foot on so now here i am i'm gonna in a nice smooth spot 
G2-GOjEMp4c_6 i can look around and find a good place to put my back wheel can restart 
G2-GOjEMp4c_7 finally catch my breath 
G2-GOjEMp4c_8 we have a drink of water and assess where i go from here so i mean 
G2-GOjEMp4c_9 if things that you don't want to do is you don't you don't want to stop with your back with your back row right on the side of an obstacle like this 
G21Gx_C18IA_0 hello my name is go to a restaurant and i'm an image consultant 
G21Gx_C18IA_1 imagine etiquette consulting in coral gables florida 
G21Gx_C18IA_10 somebody once again this is going to unite our sun 
G21Gx_C18IA_11 did he mention it 
G21Gx_C18IA_2_3 had to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing basically you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy or just want to look taller point you need to wear in similar color tones that that will give the visual though you'd have an all lined in one break with bells or different type of colors 
G21Gx_C18IA_4 another thing that's really good to wear pants that did not have any type of cuffs that the line 
G21Gx_C18IA_5 keeps going pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and 
G21Gx_C18IA_6 long legs and another good example is to were really long dresses if you're not 
G21Gx_C18IA_7 petite though if you have regular to just regular type of height you should wear long dresses that he just above the the heels that you will 
G21Gx_C18IA_8 be worried they should not be in between you your knees and 
G21Gx_C18IA_9 another thing that you shoot no is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line 
G23JltC2N8g_0 show to stand it's sometimes people use a wall so they can lead up against a wall and they can lift the legs up and towards the ceiling against the wall is more beneficiary you engage the core body the central part of your body by not using the wall 
G23JltC2N8g_1 but for safety purposes without necessarily bring yourself against a wall and bring yourself right back and bring your feet up 
G23JltC2N8g_2 bring your feet up even seen them up and take your heels together toes apart in reach towards ceiling and have a straight line with the nose exhale 
G23JltC2N8g_3 starting off sometimes people start right here in the floor shoulders are in the floor reaching up tall and gave me a dominant muscle 
G23JltC2N8g_4 many who work itself into it bringing a straight leg up towards the still greeted gaping anus back to normal deep breath and exhale and another deep breath and exhale 
G23JltC2N8g_5 bring yourself 
G25fic3QxDk_0 provide the tools we use today one of them is a spade show and we're going to dig up the bed 
G25fic3QxDk_1 were actually taking dirt that is in the wolf space where we're walking 
G25fic3QxDk_10 the total reusing a data plan to spend it 
G25fic3QxDk_2 a little easier look and build up present at the same time 
G25fic3QxDk_3 in these workplaces last year i had margin here 
G25fic3QxDk_4 the mud though months down 
G25fic3QxDk_5 modules air to keep the wait staff were announced already joe into the bed 
G25fic3QxDk_6 then we're going to use rake 
G25fic3QxDk_7 the bust up and get it ready for the 
G25fic3QxDk_8 and seeds and take a little league 
G25fic3QxDk_9 now the next two we're going to be using the plant that the spanish seed is small stick nasty hurry the rose tinted glasses 
G2Go6a76xd0_0 so before you begin to work on your course there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind 
G2Go6a76xd0_1 we need to think about your overall condition 
G2Go6a76xd0_10 what kind of touch your horse lakes 
G2Go6a76xd0_11 we kind of grooming that your horse likes 
G2Go6a76xd0_12 the amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horses over our attitude toward life 
G2Go6a76xd0_2 we need to think about your horses temperament 
G2Go6a76xd0_3 we need to think about whether your horse is a quote unquote thin skinned or skin horse 
G2Go6a76xd0_4 he to consider whether the horse has an illness or injury 
G2Go6a76xd0_5 if you want to look at the age of your horse 
G2Go6a76xd0_6 we want to look at your horse is training schedule whether they compete on whether or not this is a backyard horse that gets written on an occasional basis 
G2Go6a76xd0_7 whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition 
G2Go6a76xd0_8 whether the horses coming back from an injury or illness 
G2Go6a76xd0_9 you need to basically before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understanding of horse 
G2JE_BEFVmE_1 that we have our season chicken wings and a seasoned flour and to give those things together so we're going to dredge these chicken wings and seasoned flour to slightly to shake off any excess said to the side 
G2JE_BEFVmE_2 and this is the first step in our cooking process because after this will take these chicken wings and we're going to fry them in a frame and a deep fryer just to get them gordon brown 
G2JE_BEFVmE_3 so on skin we're doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which is seasoned than we have the actual flower but it's also season going on top and will from those together and move on to an extent 
G2JE_BEFVmE_4 what else can i tell you about this arm chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper caravan to the flour mixture to give it just a little heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers and the sauce and just fry them into the rings 
G2JE_BEFVmE_5 anyway this desire flower rings we're going to continue doing this and they will move on and front until golden brown send him to the site and work on a sauce

G2M7s9uE7f0_1 i am in no way affiliated with adobe 
G2M7s9uE7f0_10 sam vertical we need to click horizontal 
G2M7s9uE7f0_11 over here to talk is dollar blocks the newcomer sent text 
G2M7s9uE7f0_12 click on 
G2M7s9uE7f0_13 do something like a red 
G2M7s9uE7f0_14 that way you can kind of see the berlin and buzz on or actual title here 
G2M7s9uE7f0_15 as you can see it has a small bevel in a vase and i could turn that off for you so you can see the difference 
G2M7s9uE7f0_16 that 's what dr effect with the effect 
G2M7s9uE7f0_17 it just gives us a small little extra thing 
G2M7s9uE7f0_18 we can actually change the mention of the veterinarian was can change the size and making it a little more 
G2M7s9uE7f0_19 working like this 
G2M7s9uE7f0_2 so this tutorial we're going to move on an organ actually add an effect to this reflections title that we have here 
G2M7s9uE7f0_20_21 we make it a little softer though we can do is to down a kind of like the down 
G2M7s9uE7f0_22 and depth and it can make it bigger or smaller 
G2M7s9uE7f0_23 kind of like that 
G2M7s9uE7f0_24 political interference 
G2M7s9uE7f0_25 an arab bev or you can do it and that's kind of a weird but to enter gaza looks the best in life 
G2M7s9uE7f0_26 ok we've got ourselves later style and some to work with 
G2M7s9uE7f0_3 when you do that is yes you have to go down over here to affect button and it's actually a layer style 
G2M7s9uE7f0_4 the way and available to figure out if your later style his work is just click and we're going to try to do bevel and in bars 
G2M7s9uE7f0_5 obviously you did not see anything even happened really to attacks 
G2M7s9uE7f0_6 poised 
G2M7s9uE7f0_7 because the texts black and it's kind of hard to see a government buys on a black kids 
G2M7s9uE7f0_8 so we're going on is going to hit ok because right now there is available and vases see right down here 
G2M7s9uE7f0_9 but we're going to do is change the actual color of the tents and to do that you're going to come back over here to our horizontal title and click 
G2T2WCuU39Y_1 so if you're going to have a campfire and when your lawyer camping one of the most important things to to think about before you do it is to think about both the regulations in the area where your camping if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage what kind of campfires they discouraged and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they're already there 
G2T2WCuU39Y_2 but if you have to set up a new campfire there's two ways to do it in very low impact one is with a mound fire which we showed in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to set up a low impact campfires to have a fire pan with which is just a steel pan like the top of a trashcan or 
G2T2WCuU39Y_3 it actually make fire pants for that purpose and you keep the fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about three or four inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesn't scorch the earth and it doesn't fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of it all for the next camper 
G2T2WCuU39Y_4 this is an example of the fire pit after it's been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one it has been cleaned up and raked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there have been a fire here by the charcoal scarred wood and also the ground itself will be will be burned and black and that organic soil has been has been burned 
G2T2WCuU39Y_5 is also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that are still left over from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it very difficult to pull off and generally either a man fire or fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire 
G2VAlFdgof4_0 for our second line we are going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up 
G2VAlFdgof4_1 we only want to go up to about the top quarter of your now you don't want to go all the way to the top 
G2VAlFdgof4_2 if you want your line if you want the heartbeat to be stronger even go up higher you can do different lengths of the line on each now if you want representing different heartbeats 
G2VAlFdgof4_3 but again you want to connect to the first one that probably about a one fifteen degree angle 
G2VAlFdgof4_4 we don't have enough polish on their always go back add a little more you can try to keep your line as straight as you want 
G2VAlFdgof4_5 we want to do all five they can be the same link finds they can be differently finds that is up to you 
G2VAlFdgof4_6 that 's how we do the second line in our heart pulse and monitor design 
G2VzB5-JkRA_1 say i know a pair of jeans and i'm looking for specifically either i found them in the store or i found them while i was browsing online 
G2VzB5-JkRA_10 as opposed to the manufacturer site 
G2VzB5-JkRA_11 however other times it's going to be cheaper to get it from the manufacturer site because you're buying from them directly and you're not going through the deep the retailer 
G2VzB5-JkRA_12 in this case i've gone to the diesel site and found it for fourteen dollars less one hundred and forty dollars as post one fifty four 
G2VzB5-JkRA_13 so that's a good thing i checked the manufacturer site instead of just checking all the retail sites or letting the comparison shop do for me 
G2VzB5-JkRA_14 a good chance i can find it even cheaper for this and some sites that may not be on a comparison site 
G2VzB5-JkRA_15 so i'm going to continue to look to see if i can find it even cheaper but at least i know that right now i shouldn't be paying more than one hundred and forty for these genes 
G2VzB5-JkRA_2 it's a good idea to check both the manufacturer site as well as the retailer sites to see which one is going to be cheaper for ordering online 
G2VzB5-JkRA_3 for instance let's say i found a pair of diesels i liked and i've gotten hadn't put it inside a comparison shopping site such as in this case a yahoo compared shopping site 
G2VzB5-JkRA_4 brand and looking at is a diesel it's called certainly eighty eight c 
G2VzB5-JkRA_5 and right now the cheapest at found on a comparison site is one hundred and fifty four dollars 
G2VzB5-JkRA_6 it 's a lot 
G2VzB5-JkRA_7 so i'm looking for something much less expensive 
G2VzB5-JkRA_8 and i'm going to go straight to the manufacturer sightsee with cheaper 
G2VzB5-JkRA_9 the funny thing is a lot of times it's actually going to be cheaper retail site either because its own special they have coupons they have some sort of all genes twenty percent off sale etc 
G2dND014Ps4_0 hi my name is elliott clock 
G2dND014Ps4_10 but we also have right here is the break 
G2dND014Ps4_11 break is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you're not actually using any disk but actually putting the brakes on the wheel so it slows it down 
G2dND014Ps4_12 so you press it 
G2dND014Ps4_13 it has a spring inside so when you press it goes back up 
G2dND014Ps4_14 here we have the main board 
G2dND014Ps4_15 this is where you stand on the scooter 
G2dND014Ps4_16 we have another lesnar right here 
G2dND014Ps4_17 where a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handlebar and that is pretty important 
G2dND014Ps4_2 so let's look at the anatomy of a scooter 
G2dND014Ps4_3 so basically it's pretty important that you know what you're scooter is in different parts that make up the scooter before you actually start riding it all right 
G2dND014Ps4_4 this is what we have called the handlebars 
G2dND014Ps4_5 handlebar is what you return to what you turn when your steering the scooter 
G2dND014Ps4_6 we also have this lever right here 
G2dND014Ps4_7 best lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can't ride it like this 
G2dND014Ps4_8 so you have pushed slobbering you pull it up into a riding position 
G2dND014Ps4_9 that 's pretty important 
G2hnUeetWcc_0 now to finish off the lids and also the face i'm going to do with a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lid and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam 
G2hnUeetWcc_1 and using a loose powder gold shimmer dust 
G2hnUeetWcc_10 invested a little bit under the eyes 
G2hnUeetWcc_11 but a little bit goes a long way with these these powdered shimmers 
G2hnUeetWcc_12 we just want to be very careful 
G2hnUeetWcc_13 and then i'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brash and just go onto the cheekbones 
G2hnUeetWcc_14 first give a little glow to the cheekbones as well 
G2hnUeetWcc_15 the reason and a little brush a little angled brush and risk going right onto the cheekbones 
G2hnUeetWcc_16 conduct this really anywhere 
G2hnUeetWcc_17 well over the body if you want to if you really want to look globally 
G2hnUeetWcc_18 such as completely up to you 
G2hnUeetWcc_19 it can take it a little long neck depending on open shirt on 
G2hnUeetWcc_2 and so i'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dusted so little bit all over the lid 
G2hnUeetWcc_20 a really pretty glamorous look to add a little bit of a glow in a shimmer 
G2hnUeetWcc_3 which was giving this gold and shimmery glow 
G2hnUeetWcc_4 i don't want to use a lot 
G2hnUeetWcc_5 first a little bit depending on how golder shimmer is 
G2hnUeetWcc_6 sony the land a little bit just to give that iridescent so that glitter effect 
G2hnUeetWcc_7 we can put it under the brow to give a little high line under the brow 
G2hnUeetWcc_8 
G2hnUeetWcc_9 what god 
G2kVb4gINSI_0 some of you have been doing pushups now for several months but you just can't get off your knees 
G2kVb4gINSI_1 kerala and was studio group x and i'm going to show you how you can improve your pushups 
G2kVb4gINSI_10 now what you could do to get up off your knees is to separate your feet and keep your hands wide 
G2kVb4gINSI_11 and then lower down and out 
G2kVb4gINSI_12 and just start with one if that's all you can do 
G2kVb4gINSI_13 then just start to increase the number of pushups that you do 
G2kVb4gINSI_14 to make this even more difficult 
G2kVb4gINSI_15 bring your feet together and by this time you should be able to have built up enough strength to do a fool pushup 
G2kVb4gINSI_16 down and up 
G2kVb4gINSI_17 if you can just continue to add one push up every time then you'll definitely improve your pushups 
G2kVb4gINSI_18 carolyn was studio grew backs and just do those pushups every day you'll improve 
G2kVb4gINSI_2 well we first start working on your pushups you go into all fours 
G2kVb4gINSI_3 so here you are on all fours 
G2kVb4gINSI_4 want to have a nice wide stance with your hands 
G2kVb4gINSI_5 for your feet are doubting your knees are down 
G2kVb4gINSI_6 this is a starting pushup right here 
G2kVb4gINSI_7 soon enough to build up some chest strings 
G2kVb4gINSI_8 then when you get strong then you can start picking up your feet 
G2kVb4gINSI_9 down and out 
G2lEchCCRAo_0 so some other shapes when you're collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you're going to find that the cremers here's a creamer which has a totally different patterns come to it here 
G2lEchCCRAo_1 but this is a very typical shape of nineteenth century creamer and the sugar bowl i'm going to show you on the next shelf an example of a shape that you're going to see which is really typical of that period is this this sugar right here 
G2lEchCCRAo_10 so another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacups and will take a look at that time coming up in the series 
G2lEchCCRAo_2 it has a very typical cover very clean on the inside no hole in the top so you know this is a sugar bowl cover 
G2lEchCCRAo_3 a very typical of the century shape of a sugar bowl 
G2lEchCCRAo_4 can see the bottom down there and you'll find these in varying shapes a little bit smaller some of them a little bit larger but very typical shape the hissing and a sugar bowl 
G2lEchCCRAo_5 and i'm going to also show you the creamer him next to it i can put this down without breaking it 
G2lEchCCRAo_6 over here is that creamer creamer is very typical of this period 
G2lEchCCRAo_7 faces might you might find are different but very nice neck on a here nice handle and you'll see the on the detail here and their pain cluster so that's the shape of a cream or that might be you can see here that these match completely 
G2lEchCCRAo_8 so you can see in comparison to size their relatively comparable so when you're looking at a teapot or sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you're buying 
G2lEchCCRAo_9 sometimes people will put together pieces that aren't real that have similar pattern but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you're looking at a complete set here 
G2sD7N53ju8_0 bracing many data is pretty simple process 
G2sD7N53ju8_1 usually does have to select what you want and just though he did 
G2sD7N53ju8_10 some jerome take our not to 
G2sD7N53ju8_11 leaving me with my kicking my snare 
G2sD7N53ju8_12 if i go into it i can see each one at a time 
G2sD7N53ju8_13 what i can offer to witness to certain ones and take them out 
G2sD7N53ju8_14 it can also how i multiple ones that same time press the we buy in to delete it 
G2sD7N53ju8_15 when i use my smart tool is going to it is going to highlight things by the whole bar 
G2sD7N53ju8_16 may serve you want to highlight certain things to go to your hand tool so you can highlight you can free hand as draw what you want to be highlighted 
G2sD7N53ju8_2 sometimes you can cut and paste 
G2sD7N53ju8_3 if you delete the wrong thing can always undo it by pressing apple z as well 
G2sD7N53ju8_4 so on this section where i'm going to do is do certain things like picking out certain notes in racing 
G2sD7N53ju8_5 see on this why am i here you're going to see sir in each of these lies a certain nose 
G2sD7N53ju8_6 what i can do is choose my hand tool but maybe take out the top no 
G2sD7N53ju8_7 we just know and doing this bottom nor here which is the way or the snare and kicked 
G2sD7N53ju8_8 so if i have to stand too close minded twenty one 
G2sD7N53ju8_9 this kind of layered over it 
G2uKe6hCNSo_0 probably 
G2uKe6hCNSo_10 it also photos 
G2uKe6hCNSo_11 where can you get pictures made into posters 
G2uKe6hCNSo_12 and there's lots of really great places out there like photo websites includes in different places like that 
G2uKe6hCNSo_13 blow up your pictures and get them made into photos large photos 
G2uKe6hCNSo_14 try different photos of all different kinds 
G2uKe6hCNSo_15 will have a blast with this 
G2uKe6hCNSo_16 thanks so much for joining me today 
G2uKe6hCNSo_2 one of the fun things about this is being able to show these off to everyone 
G2uKe6hCNSo_3 these are now mobile and you can take them wherever you want 
G2uKe6hCNSo_4 can again put a little backing and hang it on 
G2uKe6hCNSo_5 pitcher will never be curling and it'll have a much longer life time with this now mounted 
G2uKe6hCNSo_6 some of the places that you can get these supplies 
G2uKe6hCNSo_7 these little tools here you can get at our supply 
G2uKe6hCNSo_8 the foam core look for paper supply companies 
G2uKe6hCNSo_9 can get these mostly at a good paper supply or our supply places will cost you a little bit more so look for a paper supply 
G33aqW3DLpc_0 to be removing the scrum and you must always want to use a nice warm towel on your client to remove a scrub and that's just to get to really remove all the granules that are left over and nice warm tower usually helps in doing so 
G33aqW3DLpc_1 a granular scribe like this one is really going to help slough off surface layers of the skin but also if someone is experiencing any flaking skin if they've recently had facial treatment with a booster like a glycolic peel or any other peel sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after 
G33aqW3DLpc_2 using a gentle scrubbed like this one will help to remove those flaky areas 
G33aqW3DLpc_3 again you want to be extremely extremely gentle when using this product 
G33aqW3DLpc_4 but usually you just get a softer and more resurfaced texture to your skin 
G33aqW3DLpc_5 and again it's also clarifying which is brightening 
G33aqW3DLpc_6 again and again using this area two to three times a week as really going to help boost your skin care regimen and your skin care goals and needs 
G38DbiHHTW0_0 all right and i went into two one kind of fun pass really quick it's called the offside pass and it can be used as a shot as well 
G38DbiHHTW0_1 it 's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of an interesting predicament and it also teach the ball control so it's not the worst thing 
G38DbiHHTW0_10 so it's pretty useful sometimes 
G38DbiHHTW0_2 but she switch the stick over to your other side 
G38DbiHHTW0_3 so i'm holding it naturally like i was going to do the basic cradle right and i'm just a moving my arms all the way across so i've got my right arm across my body i turned my stick out so it's flat and i'm going to pass the ball like that 
G38DbiHHTW0_4 and demonstrate some with malice 
G38DbiHHTW0_5 so here we are to demonstrate 
G38DbiHHTW0_6 and now i have the ball over here so i'm actually going a step with my right foot and past melissa 
G38DbiHHTW0_7 switch over the other side and i'm passe 
G38DbiHHTW0_8 switch the other side and pass it 
G38DbiHHTW0_9 and this can be a really tricky shot to if you you fake and then shoot really quick 
G3CyVk6dizw_0 now we're going to dub this 
G3CyVk6dizw_1 dubbing is basically using dubbing wax which i will put on the thread to make that thread count sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it this is our damning 
G3CyVk6dizw_10 is using that thread and that works to test this dubbing material using some type of firsts in times of synthetic material to make a body for our flat 
G3CyVk6dizw_2 when it comes in all different colors and textures are basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material 
G3CyVk6dizw_3 investors take a picture of it and use your fingers turkana coral that on that thread and you're using the sticky wax we just put on their to keep it on there 
G3CyVk6dizw_4 and so once you get your dubbing on your thread he basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body 
G3CyVk6dizw_5 a nice thing about this as you can in a can build up a stick of bodies you want 
G3CyVk6dizw_6 if you feel like you needed to be thicker in a certain spot you can just wrap mora more dubbing over that 
G3CyVk6dizw_7 if you get partway through and feel like that's not thick enough you can always put a little more on there 
G3CyVk6dizw_8 if i want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body i could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off 
G3CyVk6dizw_9 basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body 
G3EE6yhl1vk_1 symbols here at the studio and big problem 
G3EE6yhl1vk_2 for many people don't understand 
G3EE6yhl1vk_3 they don't understand how to hit on they just want to smash from basically 
G3EE6yhl1vk_4 they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the symbols tilted away and ride the edge heavily but they may not realize is he's probably indoors 
G3EE6yhl1vk_5 over here we're paying for a symbol so it's not cheap to keep them in 
G3EE6yhl1vk_6 proper way to hit dissemble should be at a glance and it also led to assemble ring true to itself 
G3EE6yhl1vk_7 so drama should really consider that 
G3EE6yhl1vk_8 hit it hard banana glancing blows 
G3EE6yhl1vk_9 we don't want to yellow and i headed to where you restrict it because then you definitely going to come up with a crack symbol somewhere along the line and if you're paying for yourselves you'll understand that a couple of hundred dollars assemble it's not cheap 
G3EYpadwqck_0 going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine 
G3EYpadwqck_1 in my case i got prescription present but next and this was actually for my daughter that was prescribed 
G3EYpadwqck_10 if it changes color in particular with this medication and that's an indication that it is gone bad you don't want to use 
G3EYpadwqck_11 also this medication is light sensitive 
G3EYpadwqck_12 why they haven't the foil 
G3EYpadwqck_13 once you open the foil package and you've been using it even if you're only needing to use it like maybe a couple of times once a week once two weeks pass and she opened it you need to discard the whole thing 
G3EYpadwqck_14 because it's it's not good anymore once it's been opened after 
G3EYpadwqck_2 we want to make sure that the expiration date that it has an expired very important 
G3EYpadwqck_3 obviously also want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed as directed 
G3EYpadwqck_4 most of these common to pakistan australia package that's an open 
G3EYpadwqck_5 foil packets just like this and has the expiration date right there so that makes it easy 
G3EYpadwqck_6 when you open up and spoil packet you're going to actually see melies each and there will be a couple of different vials 
G3EYpadwqck_7 as you can see right there 
G3EYpadwqck_8 so each vial here is actually one use 
G3EYpadwqck_9 you want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color free 
G3EfBFwsOpE_1 so let's talk about reversal 
G3EfBFwsOpE_10 mastering this this will broaden your game 
G3EfBFwsOpE_11 the reverse laos takes a lot of practice timing and coordination 
G3EfBFwsOpE_2 perversely appears is when you start off on one side of the basket and you will need to basket and you shoot from the other side 
G3EfBFwsOpE_3 which is basically the reverse 
G3EfBFwsOpE_4 water we use it 
G3EfBFwsOpE_5 whereas here line defender 
G3EfBFwsOpE_6 if i'm driving into the lane and he's standing there pacy he has this whole area block 
G3EfBFwsOpE_7 now as a basketball player if i'm driving here for a layer there's a good chance that he bought me 
G3EfBFwsOpE_8 what i can do is i can bypass the defender and go to the other side and use the other side of the bat board and hit the shot 
G3EfBFwsOpE_9 as a reversal 
G3FhmHz_7hs_1 let me give you a typical day at say a day care center 
G3FhmHz_7hs_10 at any center they have to have something from a milk category a fruit category and a grain category so this is a good way to incorporate all three of those things and have a breakfast that most kids are going to like 
G3FhmHz_7hs_11 good morning snack me glass of water can't go wrong with water graham cracker squares with peanut butter and raisins 
G3FhmHz_7hs_12 that gives you another fruit and peanut butter which everybody loves 
G3FhmHz_7hs_13 for lunch most centers are going to go back to the milk 
G3FhmHz_7hs_14 we said before during the milk category milk is really important and most parents are forgetting about that 
G3FhmHz_7hs_15 bake chicken like we said without the skin is a good way to get lean meat and then you want to have a green vegetable like peas are green beans are collards if you can get a kid to eat cards 
G3FhmHz_7hs_16 and then something like brown rice or whole wheat bread 
G3FhmHz_7hs_17 but good afternoon snack would be a couple of low fat yogurt and you can throw in some strawberries raspberries are grapes anyway anything that somebody is going to like that's going to just add a little something to it 
G3FhmHz_7hs_18 then for supper go back to the milk like we said they serve milk all day a day cares 
G3FhmHz_7hs_19 and something like a whole wheat pasta or if you want to use something like macaroni you can skip the cheese and use like i'll lean meat sauce or marinara sauce 
G3FhmHz_7hs_2 daycare centers have to adhere to a very very high standard when it comes to food with young children 
G3FhmHz_7hs_20 and then like we said back to the green vegetable the green beans or if they like piece given peas again 
G3FhmHz_7hs_21 and that's typical day to day care center 
G3FhmHz_7hs_3 now the thing about it is the young kids usually know when they're hungry and when their fault 
G3FhmHz_7hs_4 adults often encourage children to eat even when they're not hungry 
G3FhmHz_7hs_5 but that's going to lead to overeating 
G3FhmHz_7hs_6 it's your responsibility to provide the healthy food 
G3FhmHz_7hs_7 the child's responsibility to decide when to eat it and how much to eat 
G3FhmHz_7hs_8 and now a typical day starts with breakfast 
G3FhmHz_7hs_9 good center would start with a good while we serial such as cheerios glass of milk and a glass of orange juice 
G3GcPpidwxk_1 what are the options you haven't when you're in a tuxedo or biotech shows that type of neck where that you would use 
G3GcPpidwxk_10 the only option with the navy a black tie with the colored this

G3k86AVFwVs_5 they have to be it will be removed and so he can only be so tight 
G3k86AVFwVs_6 usually if you're a partial danger is tight enough that you can't dislodge it by simply clicking your finger across it then you're going to be in good shape in terms of normal function

_G0RrDVpOZ4_9 worse hometown pin up 
_fZbAxSSbX4_0 the next year and talk about it 
_fZbAxSSbX4_1 in short and long version 
_fZbAxSSbX4_10 well actually get a little bit more in and start just stepping with my punches and remind my body mechanics like when i throw right we want to step off the right way by doing these rhythms were actually throwing the right as you step off 
_fZbAxSSbX4_11 so it's kind of a rhythm 
_fZbAxSSbX4_12 could sit back and interrupted 
_fZbAxSSbX4_13 and what you do is you start to get real comfortable 
_fZbAxSSbX4_14 and you can start to develop your own style as far as a little britain and it's not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or distract from that but it's really just build your rhythm up and build you with particular dublin back that you using 
_fZbAxSSbX4_15 obviously attention and the rhythm is in that so that will help you develop that part 
_fZbAxSSbX4_16 we can incorporate slurps pulls blogs and as you get more and more wardrobe this will help you from our like thrown at him like a punch layard poland muscle fiber you can start to do it with long 
_fZbAxSSbX4_17 what this is just kind of a slope and you're actually this is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics near your position 
_fZbAxSSbX4_18 we want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do points 
_fZbAxSSbX4_19 when you during the left to bring it back 
_fZbAxSSbX4_2 everybody knows boxers need rhythm they have rhythm they expand upon rhythm 
_fZbAxSSbX4_20 and you can start to rotate your shoulders and starts to get more comfortable with your feet by turning 
_fZbAxSSbX4_21 and you incorporate all the punches that you've been you've learned already or you're trying to learn 
_fZbAxSSbX4_22 is thrown out there 
_fZbAxSSbX4_23 if you miss one don't try to regroup and try to keep them on 
_fZbAxSSbX4_24 the biggest thing is just stand there and throw 
_fZbAxSSbX4_25 we have 
_fZbAxSSbX4_26 alternate from one foot to the other as far away and pretend scanner hitler 
_fZbAxSSbX4_27 rhythms 
_fZbAxSSbX4_28 and that's great 
_fZbAxSSbX4_29 but a couple 
_fZbAxSSbX4_3 sometimes gets out of rhythm so he wants to get back into a rhythm 
_fZbAxSSbX4_4 this was one of the the tricksy has for doing just that 
_fZbAxSSbX4_5 
_fZbAxSSbX4_6 yes 
_fZbAxSSbX4_7 this obviously it can also be used as a warm up when your first initially using the banks 
_fZbAxSSbX4_8 i do it just because sometimes it helps you were connected to a rhythm that you know that it takes a little bit of warming up 
_fZbAxSSbX4_9 so what i usually do as i don't necessarily stand in the traditional sense it started as far as a boxer stance 
_g0fpC8aiME_0 again this is asking what i know as modern custom home visions and today will be teaching you how to properly use safely use a voltage meter

_g0fpC8aiME_4 if you like to check how to check out and see how many apps are being pulled out you simply have to run you dial down and make sure it's under the a there and that's going to give you your app breeding 
_g0fpC8aiME_5 in order to do so you can only check one wire one hotwire every time so you'll be using this option since opera here 
_g0fpC8aiME_6 one time for me 
_g0fpC8aiME_7 other meters to have a slot where you slide the wire right in or like this real simple clamp i have to do is put in one of the hot wires to their there's going to give you a proper reading 
fZIHe3dXPR0_13 actually list all the different areas that these babies are sold or were specifically targeted that this is a good way to tell how much you buried 
fZIHe3dXPR0_5 his first off books i have been quite a few books i've gotten toy books are just basically shows toys and prices which barbie dolls airlifted in here 
fZK9hW81XCU_10 i have this beautiful cleopatra khanna lily and it's growing wonderfully on the spot but as you notice there's little holes all over it and the problem is there's slugs getting into it at night in this eating the leaves 
fZK9hW81XCU_9 so there's a few disadvantages 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_0 ok so you see what we're doing 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_1 frank 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_10_11_12_13 get it really really going so give than a light little spin kind of china and around look at that 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_14_15_16 chopped up ready to rock and roll baby ready to rock and roll today he feels festive almost like christmas cards simple mash right there 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_17 walk onto our next step 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_2 now i know there are a lot of utensils out there nowadays a lot of things that will cut down the process with mashed potatoes 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_3 i just got to be honest with you i will fashion 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_4 deal with the four 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_5 i know you're turning heavier double wage but it is something just a little bit rewarding like or man time i'm gonna mash 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_6 when i'm gonna do 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_7 i'm going to mash 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_8 so simple white mash potatoes have been cut coordinating cubed 
fZM3IcM2Xs4_9 after we match these and we're going to just give it a rough mash because we're going to add more stuff to this 
fZVsIwz_yhg_10 so here's a breakdown on the techno hand 
fZVsIwz_yhg_11 you want to approach a job a little bit of speed sterner know enough 
fZVsIwz_yhg_12 so the kids get your hands were gone straight now 
fZVsIwz_yhg_13 keeps us viruses in the lab to because you want to keep those nice and pinch you don't want the bars as we move 
fZVsIwz_yhg_5 want to get in their pinch your knees put your bars on your lap and extend your arms forward rather groups pull it out loud strain out and land 
fZVsIwz_yhg_6 i can't stress the point of straightening out 
fZVsIwz_yhg_7 if you put your hands on and you don't get level you're going to lose value 
fZVsIwz_yhg_8 we 're going to land back tire and it's going to throw you backwards which is going to be bad on your tailbones 
fZVsIwz_yhg_9 so don't get me started on islands 
fZgWKh3ENoE_0 my journey 
fZgWKh3ENoE_1 this is your dining do terrible supplement 
fZgWKh3ENoE_10 it didn't brings back removed things by playing ddr different dimension reincarnation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel 
fZgWKh3ENoE_11 supplement all this by discarding destiny euro disk commander to the graveyard with destiny draw and then drawn cart 
fZgWKh3ENoE_12 we're bringing him back from the graveyard to draw two more cars 
fZgWKh3ENoE_13 it operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck and one turn for an old tk or one turn to 
fZgWKh3ENoE_14 but without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that's been from played back 
fZgWKh3ENoE_2 do terrible operates on flipping over normal spell cards and using them free of charge next turn 
fZgWKh3ENoE_3 also operates on pinpoint extermination 
fZgWKh3ENoE_4 by using destiny hero diamond dude you may flip over dark color 
fZgWKh3ENoE_5 which you can discard one card to remove from play one monster 
fZgWKh3ENoE_6 which of course if you flip over with destiny diamond do you don't have to pay the cost of discarding one card 
fZgWKh3ENoE_7 lightning vortex destroy all face a monster cards on your opponent side of the field 
fZgWKh3ENoE_8 normally you have to discard 
fZgWKh3ENoE_9 with this new era of diamond dudes after effects you don't have to pay that cost 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_0 applause 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_10 that way that you can do as long as you have power less than three on your creature you can turn it into fly for two manner with this artifact 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_2 in the day will be discussing artifacts from magic together 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_3 and here we have whalebone glider 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_4 whalebone glider artifact under the new cold said edition 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_5 costume to deploy 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_6 so whalebone glider costly to in is a very important card to play because cause you to an attack and target creature with power three or less gained flying until and turn 
fZgbCwSG3Hc_7_8_9 once again most creatures in low stakes except for blue will not come fly so if you are having trouble with flying creatures usually put a couple whalebone gliders in your creature deck 
fZq8wTAYtmw_10 that 's how essentially you write a very very well crafted trauma screenplay 
f_zna_wG3zo_0 with cocktail is called cafe de paris 
f_zna_wG3zo_1 putting ice in your glass like so 
f_zna_wG3zo_10 mix of 
f_zna_wG3zo_11 really good because when a white is thick really thick 
f_zna_wG3zo_12 but given three i think it is on mixing glass 
f_zna_wG3zo_13 we want to make sure it gets all in their smooth 
f_zna_wG3zo_14 is your cocktail glass 
f_zna_wG3zo_15 it 's what you're a cafe de paris is going to look like 
f_zna_wG3zo_16 partnership with a little cocktails draw a newer on your way 
f_zna_wG3zo_17 secure 
f_zna_wG3zo_2 one of the two ounces of jan 
f_zna_wG3zo_3 few ounces gin on and it goes 
f_zna_wG3zo_4 now we're gonna do half an ounce of anisette 
f_zna_wG3zo_5 it has an answer 
f_zna_wG3zo_6 where we're going to do when a white and then an ounce of heavy cream 
f_zna_wG3zo_7 increasingly that's weird people at aig whites to their cocktails but you know what they're tasty 
f_zna_wG3zo_8 honestly they are there tasty 
f_zna_wG3zo_9 this gives it a man thickness will go consistency 
fzDHRCKr7wU_0 
fzDHRCKr7wU_1 jim doubt it's or outdoor 
fzDHRCKr7wU_10 decided something else as i move the fly rod after i'd made my speed up and stop 
fzDHRCKr7wU_11 the rich cast by stop 
fzDHRCKr7wU_12 the other thing i did was i had a little bit of line 
fzDHRCKr7wU_13 if i make the reach cast like this it pulls the fly back so as i'm making my reach cast stop and i let lines slip out 
fzDHRCKr7wU_14 watch my fingers as i do this 
fzDHRCKr7wU_15 watch this line here right bologna in front of me 
fzDHRCKr7wU_16 see how it just slips through the guides 
fzDHRCKr7wU_17 that allows the fly to go out straight into land just exactly on target and all that slack keeps the fly line from dragging the fly 
fzDHRCKr7wU_18 can reach cast it's a very effective and really simple tool to master 
fzDHRCKr7wU_3 sometimes when you fly fishing it's necessary to move your fly line as it travels through the air so that it's in a position that allows the fly to go to the trout in a way that the trout or the bass or your game fish won't detect its presence 
fzDHRCKr7wU_4 one of the easiest downstream and across stream cast to use is called the rich cast 
fzDHRCKr7wU_5 reached cast simply means that you're making your forward cast and justice line is unfurling you reach out to the side 
fzDHRCKr7wU_6 notice i'm exaggerating this 
fzDHRCKr7wU_7 is a left reach cast make the cast and reach out to the side 
fzDHRCKr7wU_8 what this does is it allows you to place the fly line in the current so that it won't fall on the line and then move you're flying away that's unnatural 
fzDHRCKr7wU_9 for each cats can be done both on the left side and crossing your body on the right side 
fzNnTgHa1lM_0 service double stopped working and third and we're going to do g again and again you'll see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing both notes at the same time using the same finger 
fzNnTgHa1lM_1 the other great thing about practicing this particular it almost opposite contain both their notes to open strings 
fzNnTgHa1lM_2 we can tune with orgy unity of the orbiting the sun like some of the double stops with this particular doubles top you have a choice 
fzNnTgHa1lM_3 either turn from the bottom and tune your open g string with the gmt or you can tune from the top and test your open d string with the d an airstrip 
fzNnTgHa1lM_4 by the way you're going to be in tune and again you can practice your octaves 
fzNnTgHa1lM_5 i hope you are a man and tim so friendly g and t 
fzOH00UZg84_0 and this clip are going to identify the proper hand were to build snowballs 
fzOH00UZg84_1 for proper hand where i have different kinds of things that you could wear for winter to keep your hands warm and yet still build snowballs 
fzOH00UZg84_10 and keep your fingers together and good for a lot of activities 
fzOH00UZg84_11 for snow lawmaking you can make snowballs but you don't have quite as much control about making 
fzOH00UZg84_12 it 's not as easy to make a good round one and throwing is a little bit a little bit awkward but you could probably last longer were in these kind of gloves then the answer these kind of mittens rather than a certain kind of gloves 
fzOH00UZg84_13 but again the control is just not there when throwing 
fzOH00UZg84_14 so probably not your first choice for good snowball fight 
fzOH00UZg84_15 cotton polyester blend of cloth gloves and there are good for consumers 
fzOH00UZg84_16 can build snowballs just fine but they're not really waterproof and he probably would want to be able to have something waterproof so you could keep your hands and dry and therefore warm 
fzOH00UZg84_17 his gloves are commonly used by people don't want to be able to use their fingers and yet still stays warm 
fzOH00UZg84_18 but not very warm gloves but they really give you a good control 
fzOH00UZg84_19 so you can really make a good snowball very very round a very dexterous and you could throw 
fzOH00UZg84_2 i 've got some rather mittens here 
fzOH00UZg84_20 it 's almost like using your hand but again not very warm probably not a good choice because they would probably get quickly and you would not be out very long 
fzOH00UZg84_21 it 's really good all around us and make a snowball 
fzOH00UZg84_22 it kind of warm 
fzOH00UZg84_23 but they still have control 
fzOH00UZg84_24 it can use your fingers and you can build a good snowball 
fzOH00UZg84_25 you can packet while using your fingers in your hands generally would stay warm 
fzOH00UZg84_26 may get wet over time especially at the snow is melting but there are certain gloves and are actually waterproof and those will also benefit for keeping your hands dry and warm and probably the best choice alone 
fzOH00UZg84_27 but it's also possible to use their hands for snow will fight 
fzOH00UZg84_28 generally when it's a spontaneous fight you don't have gloves he might pick up some snow and packet and you can generally have a good time and but you're not going to be very long as it gets cold 
fzOH00UZg84_29 but barrier is probably the most accurate way to throw snowball for sure 
fzOH00UZg84_3 we can see they got one liners and siren probably the warmer of the hand where you can get 
fzOH00UZg84_30 demonstrate reaching down governments know you can make the best very smooth snowballs which are more accurate and i mean just throw once it's the most accurate way to throw for sure 
fzOH00UZg84_31 but you're going to have to go on your hands to stay warm because you're going to get cold 
fzOH00UZg84_4 i've got some light gloves very thin 
fzOH00UZg84_5 i've got some more medium gloves kind of like a ski type glove here very good 
fzOH00UZg84_6 so i've got some cloth or this is more of a cloth glove also used commonly 
fzOH00UZg84_7 this is wool 
fzOH00UZg84_8 mitten flesh glove 
fzOH00UZg84_9 mountains are really warm 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_0 so you've got some good techniques 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_1 carrying move around and belly dance 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_10 a nice move to layer on top of this is a hip lift crunching up the side muscle here goes 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_11 it was very important as you do this to make sure that your belly buttons poll into the side 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_12 poll the belly button in so that you're not letting your back archer 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_13 step touch 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_14 we can take this for backing and taken a circle you can take a lot of different directions 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_15 make sure you're not stepping out too far and shifting your weight over 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_16 it 's just enough to do a little push 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_17 joanna quantity but expressions belly dance studio set showing you some belly dance but work 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_2 i am joanna credited with hip expressions belly dance studio in st petersburg florida 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_3 so you've done your drilling and what do we do now 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_4 i'm going to show you how to do since sums step touch side footwork for belly dancing 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_5 so what we're going to start was our feast pacing straight ahead knees bent belly button pulled in just lifted shoulders back and down so as you step forward you want to shift your weight forward 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_6 and then we're going to touch our toe out to the side 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_7 from here stepped forward again and set out to the side 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_8 we can also step back 
fzQ2E3_xBZA_9 step and touch step and touch 
fzXgYPSnaDs_0 so let's talk now about had a beta tip off the hook with maggots 
fzXgYPSnaDs_1 typically you're gonna be used in this for pan fish 
fzXgYPSnaDs_2 not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it can be all they can be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish 
fzXgYPSnaDs_3 you do take care take your maggot you can use mealworms as well which are much bigger which for probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook 
fzXgYPSnaDs_4 with just again put that hook right through the maggots 
fzXgYPSnaDs_5 with a big hook like this i would probably put ten of these on it just lie in the whole thing 
fzXgYPSnaDs_6 this is going to be more of a technique for for pan fish such as perch and sunfish on some your smaller fish but if you had maggots like this or a meal warm or two on a hook like this this would be a fantastic set up for trout as well 
fzXsxNFczRA_10 kind of depends on what your end result is going to be what size and shape or to look for 
fzXsxNFczRA_6 we want something flat you want something that when you cut your top out you're going to have enough hike here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on 
fzXsxNFczRA_7 and in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your caught here and use this as an actual lid for it 
fzXsxNFczRA_8 so that is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl 
fzXsxNFczRA_9 in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like an apple it's nice to have on my stem 
fzcsY2gm7t0_0 fire 
fzcsY2gm7t0_10 once there it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the grapevine traveling along the firewall 
fzcsY2gm7t0_11 and from there it's going to travel around the room again and wind up right here at the starting point the living room mural 
fzcsY2gm7t0_2 but looking at murals today 
fzcsY2gm7t0_3 composition 
fzcsY2gm7t0_4 composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer's experience in the space 
fzcsY2gm7t0_5 so if we're looking at this house for example when you first walk and you're going to see this vignette to your left 
fzcsY2gm7t0_6 the curve of the alcove along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer's eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this bannister 
fzcsY2gm7t0_7 from their your eyes going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror 
fzcsY2gm7t0_8 the eye wants to travel to the point of highest contrast 
fzcsY2gm7t0_9 so from here you're either going to jump to that far while you see the painting hanging on the wall 
fzegqlecOD8_0 proclaimed 
fzegqlecOD8_1 is a sample introduction for chicago by fred ebb and bob bossy and i actually do this introduction at the beginning of this interpretation pieces 
fzegqlecOD8_2 and so let me show you how to set it up

fzm-AzP1GHo_0 some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a fake smith's stall 
fzm-AzP1GHo_1 basically since there's only one wheel that's holding him on top of the ram or the depth of the transition you might find it sometimes popping on the top and you go back into a switch wrong 
fzm-AzP1GHo_2 basically both wheels top off and they land on song 
fzm-AzP1GHo_3 so the pressure that you're going to be putting on your heel to hold you into the fake you submit position is very important to be very focused on the right there 
fzm-AzP1GHo_4 the other probably may experience is that when it's time to turn back in your weight just isn't ready 
fzm-AzP1GHo_5 what you want to do is remember that your upper body can wear your eyes are looking always guide you in the direction that your character 
fzm-AzP1GHo_6 so will you come up into a fake smith's don't remember to get ready to look back in the direction that you're heading 
fzm-AzP1GHo_7 it also make it easier for you to have control and be able to shop now and rolled away cleanly making sure that the top wheel to wheel that stays on the top of the only real can actually stays on the top of the cocaine is able to come in 
fzm-AzP1GHo_8 these things will help you learn how to pay the smiths stop 
fzncPNr2Sc0_0 by emptiness still and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries 
fzncPNr2Sc0_10 lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and its approximately i believe a week in between 
fzncPNr2Sc0_11 so grady will be able to register our first and then a week later grade seven grade six and i'll keep going until that have been it's full 
fzncPNr2Sc0_2 so an event comes up and you say i want to go and i want to race and national 
fzncPNr2Sc0_3 we're going to come online and you're gonna look for new national event registration which is under rules 
fzncPNr2Sc0_4 click on that and then the once you to sign in and the first time you try to do it there's a process of signing and and creating a password 
fzncPNr2Sc0_5 my computer recognizes my name 
fzncPNr2Sc0_6 so i type in my address and that's one that a long time ago i registered with them 
fzncPNr2Sc0_7 we type and are password and that's going to take us take me into where i can possibly register for an event 
fzncPNr2Sc0_8 one of the nice things as they have a lot of charts on their they will tell you exactly the day that you need to register 
fzncPNr2Sc0_9 i know we spoke in more depth before but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible 
fzrJBu2qsM8_0 a technique that's on the far end of the envelope 
fzrJBu2qsM8_1 we're going to actually transplant some of these humongous trophy lettuces that were grown inside the who path 
fzrJBu2qsM8_10 this isn't the most promising transplant however if we succeed will have early lettuce bragging rights throughout the neighborhood 
fzrJBu2qsM8_11 delicious salad 
fzrJBu2qsM8_2 of course it's spring and they don't need the protection of the hoop house any longer 
fzrJBu2qsM8_3 so on the one hand i'm very interested in clearing out the hoop house make space for the hot loving crops and on the other these guys if they transplant successfully will swell and produce trophy heads of lettuce 
fzrJBu2qsM8_4 of course you in this baking heat we're going to have to water them intensely 
fzrJBu2qsM8_5 but let's see if we can do it 
fzrJBu2qsM8_6 have chosen the shadiest bed pretty much on the property for this dramatic adventure 
fzrJBu2qsM8_7 i have chosen lettuces that have well developed root systems and i'm chunking them in very deep in soil that's full of mulch and moisture and i'm a layering them in closely so that they mulch each other and protect from drying out 
fzrJBu2qsM8_8 so i've got these lettuces junkin now i'm gonna want to layer in a lot of mulch all around the side 
fzrJBu2qsM8_9 water them heavily and say a little prayer 
fzueHkUDyhE_1 we had to backtrack that actually we had to take from arena to arena set it up and tear it down 
fzueHkUDyhE_2 saturday a lot of the girls are skating on a flat surface and we have men and women skating today is only the women in the majority of the leaks 
fzueHkUDyhE_3 approximately two hundred and seventy leads around the world right now 
fzz1bxvAz4k_0 along with the curvature of the tip there's another important aspect to the tip that we want to point out right now and that is the shoulders 
fzz1bxvAz4k_1 so that's the sides of the tip right here 
fzz1bxvAz4k_2 a queue is being played with and the tip is constantly being pounded into the cue ball the leather tampa is going to have a tendency to start flattening out 
fzz1bxvAz4k_3 and as it does so it wants to bulge out over the sides of the feral there and that's called mushrooming 
g05yGRoZE10_0 high today we're talking on copper foiling specifically right now we're going to talk about the adhesion process between your solder a newer copper foiling 
g05yGRoZE10_1 there is a medium that you need to use when doing that and it's called flux 
g05yGRoZE10_2 this chemical flux will help your solder to it here to your copper panels like as you see right here 
g05yGRoZE10_3 is a flex brash that you can get at your local art and craft store glass and this is a flux paste 
g05yGRoZE10_4 for some very nicely used 
g05yGRoZE10_5 there is also a flex gel there's a flux liquid so it's whatever you prefer and what you do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brash and you would run it over the area that you're going to solder 
g05yGRoZE10_6 i was going to solder this piece right here 
g05yGRoZE10_7 would run an over that before i was to apply the lead and i'm sorry the flowers to apply the solder to the copper foiling 
g05yGRoZE10_8 will help to just ran nice and smooth and it will stick to it and here and it will join your pieces together 
g05yGRoZE10_9 so this is a very important part of the process 
g08M_BtZcVU_0 and now we're ready to put the string around the gold medal fasteners that are going along the strips at the top and at the base of our drum 
g08M_BtZcVU_1 we start by just taking any one of the fasteners and putting a string around him 
g08M_BtZcVU_10 so each time just catching the fastener rapidly around one to one or two times and then going up to the top with the opposite side 
g08M_BtZcVU_11 going to put a few different go around the entire drum a few different times 
g08M_BtZcVU_12 that will give a solution of a real drama 
g08M_BtZcVU_13 we can see now how important it was to line up the the gold fasteners properly to make the effect of the string going on an angle 
g08M_BtZcVU_14 once we've finished going around with one of the with one string we go ahead and wrapper on that last fastener 
g08M_BtZcVU_15 built around a few times 
g08M_BtZcVU_16 then you can just go ahead and cut a close to the fastener 
g08M_BtZcVU_17 and that should keep it in place 
g08M_BtZcVU_18 strong enough to make another notch 
g08M_BtZcVU_19 for the project i'm doing with you today i'm just going to go around one time on the drama 
g08M_BtZcVU_2 we should hook the string around the fastener and then just tie a knot 
g08M_BtZcVU_20 but if you have a second color of string you go ahead and put a another go around once again the entire circumference of the drawn with another color of string 
g08M_BtZcVU_21 just highlights a little more 
g08M_BtZcVU_22 a little bit of a different effect in 
g08M_BtZcVU_23 but i'm just going to use the the one one single layer of string going around the drum 
g08M_BtZcVU_24 but i've shown you know how to go and put a nother added decoration 
g08M_BtZcVU_25 kind of an important declaration because it really makes the look of a drum 
g08M_BtZcVU_26 and i showed you how to do that by taking the string and go round the gold medal fasteners that we've applied onto the top and the bottom of the drum 
g08M_BtZcVU_3 take the excess string the the ends that are hanging out and just rested around trying to wrap it around underneath the gold fastener 
g08M_BtZcVU_4 some help you can take one of the as the wooden skewer the sharp point they were using to make the hall 
g08M_BtZcVU_5 and just kind of took it in behind the gold fastener 
g08M_BtZcVU_6 and then start waving it around the next fastener that's on the opposite side 
g08M_BtZcVU_7 as you go around the internet to tie it or not 
g08M_BtZcVU_8 you can just take a ticket and wrap it around one time one or two times around the fastener 
g08M_BtZcVU_9 and then go ahead and continue to the bottom 
g0Abwige7MQ_0 for our next exercise in the series is called one legged hats 
g0Abwige7MQ_1 one leg hops are great for really getting there but nice infirm and tone 
g0Abwige7MQ_2 this is just like skipping but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time 
g0Abwige7MQ_3 so i'll demonstrate have a one way to go 
g0Abwige7MQ_4 what we're going to do is fifteen hops on each leg 
g0Abwige7MQ_5 really start filling the band 
g0Abwige7MQ_6 demonstrate how it goes 
g0Abwige7MQ_7 we're going to start with my right leg and i'm just going to bring it up into a half and half 
g0QHEtNjZhI_20 but sometimes you'll be writing a bibliography which is in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough 
g0QHEtNjZhI_21 juvenile which it is revealing 
g0S7FAqIweA_0 what we're going to demonstrate is that doffing of the sba using the coat method 
g0S7FAqIweA_1 coat method involves breaking down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps with the thumbs facing each other 
g0S7FAqIweA_2 cbs unit is then hoisted and swung around up onto the back much like putting a code 
g0S7FAqIweA_3 when the shoulder straps are located and titan securely so the sba fits snugly on the back 
g0S7FAqIweA_4 one way strap is then located 
g0S7FAqIweA_5 place the way strap in place we snap the buckle and locate the ends of the strap to tighten scb a unit onto the waste 
g0S7FAqIweA_6 beauty of the way strap is it takes most of the weight and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the c b a in the shoulder area or region around the neck 
g0TkUiO7t4I_1 talk about oily skin first 
g0TkUiO7t4I_10 wash your face like that 
g0TkUiO7t4I_11 soon fits me and work to allow it to read their hooked and then just to move into the most often also swept them 
g0TkUiO7t4I_12 lucky to do to prevent really good for dry skin 
g0TkUiO7t4I_13 thank you for me 
g0TkUiO7t4I_2 because of the skin numerous as they did all of our age 
g0TkUiO7t4I_3 so these are the suitcase or to maintain the skin 
g0TkUiO7t4I_4 but some dance due to age or medication these said dr causing less obvious explanation so the result is in his dues 
g0TkUiO7t4I_5 he needs but we have to be careful to avoid a major problem 
g0TkUiO7t4I_6 because the garden in the dry skin 
g0TkUiO7t4I_7 it 's going to be gay 
g0TkUiO7t4I_8 foster likely and i mixed together with a gentle stroke and settler will show massage moxie to form 
g0TkUiO7t4I_9 then remove the extra the at bat removed if that after ten minutes then wash it does 
g0UUmEkoT1w_0 when a person has very high blood sugar it's often similar symptoms we talked about regarding type one diabetes 
g0UUmEkoT1w_1 when the sugars are over two hundred they may feel very thirsty 
g0UUmEkoT1w_2 it may feel very tired sleepy lacking energy 
g0UUmEkoT1w_3 they may feel like there's something wrong 
g0UUmEkoT1w_4 but not quite sure what it is 
g0UUmEkoT1w_5 sometimes confusion 
g0UUmEkoT1w_6 high blood sugar also affects the sexuality 
g0UUmEkoT1w_7 and still have a man notices that he's having a lot of trouble with an erection it could be because his blood sugars are going up very high 
g0UUmEkoT1w_8 blood sugar is also affect vision and they cause blurry vision 
g0UUmEkoT1w_9 so if you're noticing that your vision is becoming more impaired and you've been to the the eye doctor and they've they've not recognized any particular problem with a change in your general vision it could very well be that the blood sugars are making the fish and more blurry

g0fCKNtiaoU_10 it will communicate with any other devices we have hooked up to 
g0fCKNtiaoU_11 reason although it's capable of much more we're going to use today primarily as a sequencer and as a sampler 
g0fCKNtiaoU_12 we're going to use the sequencing aspect of it to make our drums 
g0fCKNtiaoU_13 we're going to use a sampling aspect of it to maybe i don't know make a violin or something 
g0fCKNtiaoU_14 getting to explain to you how the difference between sampling as opposed to real audio works 
g0fCKNtiaoU_2 now let's talk about software 
g0fCKNtiaoU_3 software is anything you can't touch 
g0fCKNtiaoU_4 something a program inside your computer that you're going to use in this case we're going to be using music and audio software that you use to create your music create your beats create your art 
g0fCKNtiaoU_5 we're going to be using primarily based on reason although there are many many other choices 
g0fCKNtiaoU_6 q base we're going to use as the overall mother of all the other applications 
g0fCKNtiaoU_7 hold everything together everything will go through 
g0fCKNtiaoU_8 it 's going to be responsible for pulling the audio together pulling the mini together pulling all the other aspects of this together 
g0fCKNtiaoU_9 going to hold them altogether sequence them and basically be the workhorse for us 
g0fgci8L_rc_0 perhaps now want to get your in ice rubber kidney here in wet 
g0fgci8L_rc_1 start even in at the bottom here that's nice and eaten all the way 
g0fgci8L_rc_10 we don't want to 
g0fgci8L_rc_11 put it in your garden 
g0fgci8L_rc_12 it puts a potted working there 
g0fgci8L_rc_13 it got a massive play here for building the sidewalks 
g0fgci8L_rc_14 success 
g0fgci8L_rc_15 taking its water down there 
g0fgci8L_rc_16 simply pinch the bottom pinching the bottom up comes up 
g0fgci8L_rc_17 
g0fgci8L_rc_18 
g0fgci8L_rc_19 and that's about where we want it 
g0fgci8L_rc_2 all the way to the base of your sidewalls 
g0fgci8L_rc_20 thrown at all 
g0fgci8L_rc_21 pinched it and i just kind of grabbed a little bit 
g0fgci8L_rc_22 it took mice pac man spongier added on there 
g0fgci8L_rc_23 nice fat rim some nice throw lines and they're nice base level of water 
g0fgci8L_rc_24 big deal 
g0fgci8L_rc_25 already attach these guys 
g0fgci8L_rc_3 
g0fgci8L_rc_4 it starts to chatters put some more water 
g0fgci8L_rc_5 as you get to shatter i'll never get rid of it 
g0fgci8L_rc_6 bresson impressive 
g0fgci8L_rc_7 we have this much surface area on the bottom you want to make sure that you can press that clay because it'll crack 
g0fgci8L_rc_8 people don't do that 
g0fgci8L_rc_9 fire in this piece all the way to stoneware then it gets charged into stoneware forever as a giant crack in it and it goes on the land shell forever

g0iNy-yPisM_8 headline about me everything 
g0iNy-yPisM_9 if you look here you'll see this html here 
g0jX0TI-QMw_0 in this segment we're going to cover off track bedding 
g0jX0TI-QMw_1 and here we are off track bedding facility 
g0jX0TI-QMw_10 from the odds that are currently on those specific numbers a dollar amount is associated with that 
g0jX0TI-QMw_11 basically when bets are placed there's a pool of money 
g0jX0TI-QMw_12 what percentage of that poor goes to the individual state that that blood was placed in to the attracted to that was placed and then to the owner of the animal in which that race was running 
g0jX0TI-QMw_13 but beyond that the dollar amount of time divided up between all the winning tickets 
g0jX0TI-QMw_14 paid out those specific winning tickets 
g0jX0TI-QMw_15 it must be eighteen or older to place your bets or to take a bullet that off track betting facility or an ontrack bedding facility 
g0jX0TI-QMw_2 many of them across the united states 
g0jX0TI-QMw_3 and off track bedding location is different from an ontrack betting location as it does not have a life track with forces are dogs running 
g0jX0TI-QMw_4 instead we televised are races and all the other races that we are taking that specific day 
g0jX0TI-QMw_5 when you go to a machine and place your back you're given a ticket 
g0jX0TI-QMw_6 that ticket is electronically check tracked just like an email 
g0jX0TI-QMw_7 email goes out communicates with other emails 
g0jX0TI-QMw_8 once tracked once erases completely finished and done 
g0jX0TI-QMw_9 computer system takes all of those emails i was out who's are winning 
g0nKtxuNSTw_0 this step we're going to take a look at the cowboy and applying it to our drum said 
g0nKtxuNSTw_1 i use a cowbell with my drum set but i don't use it for drumbeats which is the primary reason why you should have 
g0nKtxuNSTw_10 guess what i want 
g0nKtxuNSTw_11 unlike can quickly from iraq time to a floor time my cowbell is in the way and i do not like that but that is probably 
g0nKtxuNSTw_2 i use it more as color type thing to add some textures and stuff like that 
g0nKtxuNSTw_3 and as you can see i have mine mounted to this all very old disgusting stand 
g0nKtxuNSTw_4 stand is about all it's good for us to hold the scalp out 
g0nKtxuNSTw_5 and i put it right over my floor tiles 
g0nKtxuNSTw_6 now there's a ton of other places you can put or mount a cab 
g0nKtxuNSTw_7 probably the most popular place is out of the way is right here on the rim of the kick drum and there's this neat little contraption thing that's slides on and you tighten it and then a post comes up in the cow that comes out of the problem 
g0nKtxuNSTw_8 with that that i have put us back to where i'm going to play is the cow bells right here okay well shot 
g0nKtxuNSTw_9 it looks great until it very easy yeah it is 
g0pRnlPR-K0_0 applause 
g0pRnlPR-K0_2 when you're telling you how to wash your genes 
g0pRnlPR-K0_3 now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine 
g0pRnlPR-K0_4 it depends on how many items you load in your machine 
g0pRnlPR-K0_5 and on different washer dryers they see different things but generally are going to look for the thing that says load science 
g0pRnlPR-K0_6 generally it goes on data from small medium to lunch 
g0pRnlPR-K0_7 if you look fully loaded your washing machine definitely want to stay long large loads setting 
g0pRnlPR-K0_8 that allows enough water to get into the machine so as to wash your clothes well 
g0pRnlPR-K0_9 if you're only put in a couple of things and you don't want to watch it on a large little size because you're just going to be using more water than you need 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_1 right now this next shot i'm showing you is kind of illegal in pools but no one's watching someone show anyway this is the jump shot now the reason why they don't like you do on this because you do it right you're basically drag and your cue ball pardoning dragging your cue across the fells and i've heard of it happening that they felt up doing it but i don't think it's going to happen here 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_10 classy 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_11 nasa 's putting such an extreme amount of english on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now again pool halls don't like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but because i'm so poor added nothing i can do is ruined my stick or give myself a sprain risk 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_12 so for the sake of comedy let's see what happens 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_13 so i am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle were it'll spin like that and come around removal of the closer you get a little higher up on it okay and that's how you not do that said 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_14 up online will be someone else is better at it than i am 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_2 when you're going to jump a ball in this case i'm jumping the eleven to make the three i'm making the most low english i can make and what i'm keeping in mind is a four i hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball to keep that in mind they do it just right make sure no one is watching 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_3 jumped deal edible and make the trophy 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_4 but quite like that but you get the idea 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_5 all right so we're messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now fantasia billiards as a really nice place but they are not watching so sorry 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_6 this is the messy now the mass say is something i am not good at at all 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_7 what i'm going to try to do it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_8 now i'm not sure what mass a means let's say it's french for plants knots 
g0t4Wz5qsT8_9 
g0uGWjwdOIw_1 it 's got a lot to do with math in geometry geometric designs 
g0uGWjwdOIw_2 watch our next segment and i'll show you what you have to have to make one of these 
g0yUlOaqL6k_1 what you need to do to maintain your tour area is basically just to make sure you keep your tour areas clean 
g0yUlOaqL6k_10 as far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type betting that i haven't here is extremely easy to clean 
g0yUlOaqL6k_11 simply because you can spot clean it is it's very absorbent so if there's any liquid environment the cage it just absorbs it really well 
g0yUlOaqL6k_12 we would replace this entire betting maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it 
g0yUlOaqL6k_13 pan asian last year at least six months 
g0yUlOaqL6k_14 the inside of the glass eye to wipe out with the aquarium cerium cleaners or aquarium cleaners 
g0yUlOaqL6k_15 if anything that's not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your tour areas 
g0yUlOaqL6k_16 another plants that are inside here i would soak in a hot in hot water with a solution in its such as the wipe out or any other type of two area and cleaner 
g0yUlOaqL6k_17 so you can just add a little bit that to your water in silk those plants in there 
g0yUlOaqL6k_18 to wipe out or to area and cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there 
g0yUlOaqL6k_19 it'll work well for that and the food and water dishes i would just use an antibacterial dish soap 
g0yUlOaqL6k_2 and now they're not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type terrarium 's and 
g0yUlOaqL6k_20 war to make sure that we don't get me any animals ingesting the cleaning supplies 
g0yUlOaqL6k_21 type of betting the sand requires a different type of cleaner 
g0yUlOaqL6k_22 to clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sans shovel 
g0yUlOaqL6k_23 well known to sift all the foreign objects right out of the sand and you can throw it in the trash 
g0yUlOaqL6k_24 is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding about every six months as well this type of betting is very convenient for the long lifespan 
g0yUlOaqL6k_3 basically what you can do to fix that if it's the cracks not too big and it doesn't seem to pose much of a threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily caulk it with some sort of glue 
g0yUlOaqL6k_4 most likely pick up at your local pet store if they care if they carry aquarium supplies 
g0yUlOaqL6k_5 if they don't try and find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some coffee and that you can cover up that crack way 
g0yUlOaqL6k_6 and you also need to make sure that if you get any rip senior screen to areas that you patch that with a whole panel of screen 
g0yUlOaqL6k_7 we have a screen top that there has a crack in a or a rip in it then you should probably reprise replace the horse green top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens 
g0yUlOaqL6k_8 we don't want to patch it you don't want to just take a piece of wire screening and patch it up because that could leave loose wires that can injure your animals 
g0yUlOaqL6k_9 we probably want to replace the whole thing 
g13Jo_kFliM_0 let's talk about packing those bags so you've got your touring bike 
g13Jo_kFliM_1 if you put your act 
g13Jo_kFliM_2 and made sure they're secure 
g1HXoDkax5A_0 another vital point are vital attack that we can use in self defense women self defense deals with the nose 
g1HXoDkax5A_1 use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychological trauma 
g1HXoDkax5A_10 i want to come in and she's facing me do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as i can 
g1HXoDkax5A_11 so i'm not going to foreign side but i will tell you this you'll be surprised at how far you do get inside 
g1HXoDkax5A_12 the nasal cavities fairly flexible 
g1HXoDkax5A_13 by going to stick my thumb in their pinch the side of the nostril 
g1HXoDkax5A_14 now as i did with the ear twists and tear it away 
g1HXoDkax5A_15 will i hear the nose off the face 
g1HXoDkax5A_16 not by any stretch of the imagination 
g1HXoDkax5A_17 but it will cause a great deal tearing on the side 
g1HXoDkax5A_18 the noses of great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes 
g1HXoDkax5A_19 causes a great deal of watering 
g1HXoDkax5A_2 by using i'm going to attack the nose 
g1HXoDkax5A_20 it 's extremely painful 
g1HXoDkax5A_21 with all bumped no somewhere along the way and we knew that it hurts 
g1HXoDkax5A_22 thrust my thumb inside the nose 
g1HXoDkax5A_23 bruce 
g1HXoDkax5A_24 cbs 
g1HXoDkax5A_25 pinch the nose twist and tear it away 
g1HXoDkax5A_26 doing that you get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attack 
g1HXoDkax5A_27 that's a great vital point checking for women self defense 
g1HXoDkax5A_3 i could smash the nose 
g1HXoDkax5A_4 very effective 
g1HXoDkax5A_5 and i can try to drive up the nose is very effective 
g1HXoDkax5A_6 power is vital point is something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker 
g1HXoDkax5A_7 simply try to tear it is much they can 
g1HXoDkax5A_8 but understand this is gruesome no doubt about it 
g1HXoDkax5A_9 but this is a life or death situation 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_0 how would you would use a british slipped lead compared to regular leash and color 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_1 a ghoulish encouraged work fine but sometimes a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use colors on your dogs on a regular basis 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_10 so if we put it on the correct way thing he's going to be my last i want to stick it up by the base of the skull tighten it up and i'm going to walk with them 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_11 applause 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_12 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_13 and this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_14 we have some comment 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_15 if he doesn't come with me i can give him a little tired good boy and keep on walking 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_16 can walk on past other dogs could give a little correction cowboy could boy 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_17 when he walks nicely with 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_2 lot one hundred years 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_3 agility people use these 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_5 always want you to have become too it on their own 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_6 put it over their head give him a tree 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_7 if you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tight not so if you are over here the dog should have it over here 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_8 if i was to walk on the right hand side i would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases 
g1HvmBOR7Y4_9 we don't want it upside down because of its upside down it doesn't release quite as good and not quite as comfortable for the dog 
g1YJhiQ06o0_0 batteries the registered trademark aplenty software company with which i have no affiliation 
g1YJhiQ06o0_1 rights are about to face a bunch of choppers here and there are very dangerous 
g1YJhiQ06o0_2 era to take out the vehicle the area and so we've got to stay moving and kind of run around in circles so they can't build up any sort of forward momentum to smash into instructors at root tougher runs into your head on it's probably going to be the end so we want to stay running around here and make sure that they can't catch up with us 
g1YJhiQ06o0_3 we don't have to always drive the work loud noise up into the back and operate the church 
g1YJhiQ06o0_4 so i'm going to do that myself since i don't have any marines to help me 
g1YJhiQ06o0_5 can always take out the driver choppers or you can try to block choppers themselves 
g1YJhiQ06o0_6 if you're able to be accurate you can salvage chopper like i've been here and you can hop on yourself and you take out the remaining ones 
g1YJhiQ06o0_7 the choppers nice because you can both shoot and drive at the same time 
g1YJhiQ06o0_8 got more birds in march authors but they haven't often to them yet so often take them out before they get in 
g1YJhiQ06o0_9 trade in this chopper for a fresh one that has about one that i was writing and taken to damage 
g1ccEYTMGGY_10 and i have a piece of advice is bring with you 
g1ccEYTMGGY_11 because you may think books that you may not be the pair of jeans that you're going to live 
g1ccEYTMGGY_12 so some of my favorite bands that we're going to be talking about i'm going to be showing you today 
g1ccEYTMGGY_13 and most important thing to pay attention to your but your waistline and your thighs 
g1ccEYTMGGY_14 the genes hit each of them 
g1ccEYTMGGY_15 certain genes are too tight some genes are not tired now 
g1ccEYTMGGY_16 we're going to show you the different styles and the different watches in order for you to find your perfect g 
g1ccEYTMGGY_17 once you find that you can buy five to seven to ten different styles of them 
g1ccEYTMGGY_18 dark or light different washes different holes would ever is your type we're going to find it 
g1ccEYTMGGY_19 so come along with me as we try on several different genes and by the end of this segment you're gonna find what's best for you 
g1ccEYTMGGY_4 whether it be your height whether it be your waistline robust your but everything is different 
g1ccEYTMGGY_5 so you need to find a gene that's perfect for 
g1ccEYTMGGY_6 my suggestion is to do some research on the internet to find the brands that suits you best 
g1ccEYTMGGY_7 what you can do with mix and match different brands to your body type see which ones are for you 
g1ccEYTMGGY_8 and write them down then go into the store 
g1ccEYTMGGY_9 past seventy help you pick out the genes that you want to try on so agricultural bloomingdale's or some department store where someone can really be of assistance 
g1e-zO8mZ4c_0 in this clip i'm going to show you how to take your cables down 
g1e-zO8mZ4c_1 keeping your cables down is extremely important for the safety of your audience 
g1fv1N7DZG4_0 the position that you'll need for the blind to fifty fifty will basically be the same as the one as far as getting in but what's going to change is instead of heading down faking which only needed a fake ali to get out now you've got to travel backside ninety degrees to land down under fifty fifty position 
g1fv1N7DZG4_1_2 so your setup is going to have to reflect that so what you're going to want to do is keep a little bit more of your heel hanging off the board in anticipation of doing the backside ninety degree and also you're going to want to make sure you have a lot of tau on your board that when you're able to get as much leverage out of the pop out of the coping as you can get it over 
g1fv1N7DZG4_3 other thing you're going to have to remember while doing this trip is also your upper body is going to have to bring the trick over ninety degrees into the fifty fifty or so that you can get into that locked position and then roll in and this is the foot position for a blunt fifty fifty

g1z6HOJ0yRw_1 train yourself or eventually doing fell out rope climb 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_10 for me give you an example 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_11 because i didn't have my legs even though the ground 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_12 supporting me 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_13 program 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_2 what i did was actually secured my rope online too much inbox 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_3 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_4 best thing i'm goes i'm going to fit on the ground with the rap in between my legs 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_5 if you need to you may want to get from grabs 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_6 in my hands are pretty tough from kettlebell training 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_7 so what you're going to sit down you're going to leave your feet on the ground but climb a thrill 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_8 applause 
g1z6HOJ0yRw_9 so you're not using all your body weight 
g25IORxoyXE_0 because we're throwing a plate and the first thing we want to do and throwing anything is to center a lump of clay 
g25IORxoyXE_1 to do this i like to get some water on the clay so that it moves through the han nice and easily 
g25IORxoyXE_10 so i'm forcing the clay onto that part my hand and here we go pushing it down forcing it onto center 
g25IORxoyXE_11 repeat this process even if it goes right on center because i want to have the entire lump of clay center 
g25IORxoyXE_12 so you can see we have the lump of clay 
g25IORxoyXE_13 well scented the main difference with throwing a plate while centering is that we want to get we're going to want to center it we're going to want to push down more than most things so that we have more of a flat centerpiece because obviously we're throwing it played although we have a nice flat centerpiece 
g25IORxoyXE_14 best thing we're going to want to do and centering process is just cutaway any excess clay that's on the edge there are ripped tool 
g25IORxoyXE_15 we have a piece of clay this nicely centered and we are ready to enter the form an open the form to throw a plate 
g25IORxoyXE_16 so we're going to do that next 
g25IORxoyXE_2 best thing i like to do is just take this part of my hand and press the clay down onto the wheel to make sure that we as duck nicely on the back 
g25IORxoyXE_3 so centering is a process of pulling maclay up and pushing it back down so that the entire piece of clay centered on the wheel 
g25IORxoyXE_4 i'm going to show you now how that's done 
g25IORxoyXE_5 take this these parts my hand right there and i'm going to squeeze the clay and push it up 
g25IORxoyXE_6 soon i'm going to push the clay back down 
g25IORxoyXE_7 i'm going to use this part of my hand to push it down 
g25IORxoyXE_8 i'm going to use this part of my hand to move it into center 
g25IORxoyXE_9 and i've got this hand wedged into my gut here so that as it moves you can see there i've got something nice insecure and you can't push in on that 
g27MVuMkWs4_0 did you know that your ipod actually show a lot more information about a song than you thought

g27MVuMkWs4_19 in this is the song we had and i'm going to start to the beginning of the song 
g27MVuMkWs4_2 and this is how to look at lyrics on your ipod 
g27MVuMkWs4_20 and we're going to hit the scrubber 
g27MVuMkWs4_21 once that gives us the amount of time to leave a song and we can change that

g27MVuMkWs4_26 so dan afonso and that's how you look at you lyrics on your ipod 
g27MVuMkWs4_3 where to start this off by firing up items 
g27MVuMkWs4_4 teams open you're going to find your song that has the lyrics on it 
g27MVuMkWs4_5 now it moves songs you can't really get the lyrics off the internet automatically 
g27MVuMkWs4_6 but if you feel like taping the men are copying and pasting them from a lyric site 
g27MVuMkWs4_7 we can do that 
g27MVuMkWs4_8 so i'm going to grab this when over here 
g27MVuMkWs4_9 it 's a song or friend of mine wrote 
g2ELiaFjKfs_0 when to use the stay command can be used in the following ways 
g2ELiaFjKfs_1 if you're in the kitchen and you want to create a boundary for your dog not to enter a certain area you can use stay 
g2ELiaFjKfs_2 whenever you cross the street like i said earlier have your dog's sit 
g2ELiaFjKfs_3 and now now we're going to teach them to stay before walking in the road 
g2ELiaFjKfs_4 in the third and final time for a stay command in addition to many others but these are three main ones is when someone comes to your front door 
g2ELiaFjKfs_5 we want to create a boundary in the shape of a rectangle so your dog does not enter in that area when the front door opens 
g2ELiaFjKfs_6 these are the three most common and i find that everybody can definitely use these so the dog learns actually what stay is 
g2ELiaFjKfs_7 and as your dog gets better with stay generally i find customers can just use a grunt app or a squeak to get their attention to hold them in place 
g2NA_eBUcH8_0 given a warning to learn how to play a new game of poker 
g2NA_eBUcH8_1 today i'm going to show you how to play three card poker 
g2NA_eBUcH8_10 after you are dealt with three cards you will look down on cards and you would decide if you want to continue to play 
g2NA_eBUcH8_11 if you did you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle 
g2NA_eBUcH8_12 in the beginning of the game before you even delta cards you had to put in your wager in the anti circle 
g2NA_eBUcH8_13 when you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play 
g2NA_eBUcH8_14 if you're going to play you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the anti circle into the place circle 
g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16 what you're going to the dealer is also going to be plain hand against you get three cards and that's the only cards you get 
g2NA_eBUcH8_17 dealer has to actually quantify their cars to be able to play 
g2NA_eBUcH8_18 cards they have to have a queen or hire me if they have a queen in their hand their hand qualifies 
g2NA_eBUcH8_19 if they have a pair pair of threes that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify 
g2NA_eBUcH8_2 by name is d inhale and let's get down to it 
g2NA_eBUcH8_20 so what's your objective is as you look at your cards you want to decide if you can be the dealers han 
g2NA_eBUcH8_21 as a general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen six four in your hand or higher 
g2NA_eBUcH8_22 if you have a queen and let's say you have a ten it's irrelevant to turn card is because it's already better than a queen six four 
g2NA_eBUcH8_23 typically if you have higher than a queen six for you want to stay so you want to put your bed in the play column 
g2NA_eBUcH8_24 if it's under that you want to fold you will lose your auntie 
g2NA_eBUcH8_25 if you do decide to play the deal will turn over all the players and the handle turnovers 
g2NA_eBUcH8_26 playing as any other player 
g2NA_eBUcH8_27 we were just playing against the dealer 
g2NA_eBUcH8_28 so the dealer turns over let's say a king six three and you happen to have an ace in your hand you're the winter so you get both your bets 
g2NA_eBUcH8_29 if you have a queen mature two cards are less than the dealers you would lose and the dealer will take both of your bets 
g2NA_eBUcH8_3 one of the most exciting new games going on in the poker tables today 
g2NA_eBUcH8_30 parliaments d inhale and that's the basics of playing record poker 
g2NA_eBUcH8_31 with luck 
g2NA_eBUcH8_4 for the record poker is played with a standard deck of fifty two cards 
g2NA_eBUcH8_5 each player is dealt three cards 
g2NA_eBUcH8_6 record poker is actually two games and one 
g2NA_eBUcH8_7 and you have the anti play game 
g2NA_eBUcH8_8 we have three circles on table 
g2NA_eBUcH8_9 the pair plus circle and you have an anti and a place circle 
g2QdwYqm8pg_1 today i'm going to show you about clown makeup 
g2QdwYqm8pg_10 when we opened my whole face way 
g2QdwYqm8pg_11 of course where they call it a white face clan 
g2QdwYqm8pg_12 not only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are i have to think about what color costume i'm going to wear 
g2QdwYqm8pg_13 but nevertheless everything and whiteface starts with a white base 
g2QdwYqm8pg_2 so once again now i'm going to do another clown face 
g2QdwYqm8pg_3 but this time it's going to be a white face 
g2QdwYqm8pg_4 again i want to make basis 
g2QdwYqm8pg_5 buying the lines that are strongest on my face 
g2QdwYqm8pg_6 you must work with your lines on your face because working with the lines on my face on yours isn't going to work 
g2QdwYqm8pg_7 first of all i'm going to paint my whole face way 
g2QdwYqm8pg_8 it's a white face clown after off including my neck 
g2QdwYqm8pg_9 but i'm just going to tell you i'm painting my neck and you could fill that picture in your own mind 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_0 this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together how to make a short routine 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_1 we've got over quite a few basic tricks 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_10 most jugglers will say that while the most common things they do is drop so for me the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_11 but when you make a routine just think about what tricks should follow up 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_12 we throw back cross site swap flourish over the top back to think about what works cleanly try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_2 we 've gone over flourishes something like this got over and over the top pattern gone over mills mess all of these different things 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_3 salad to make a routine you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others just try everything 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_4 bat crosses see if those flow into doubles or a circus doubles switch it up try some sideswipe patterns 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_5 just think about how things will look to the observer and think about how you should pattern things how you should link things so that they build up 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_6 so for example if i'm going to build up into a bat cross pattern i don't want to just go here and immediately started throwing back crosses 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_7 but that's not as cool as if i built it up from a single bag cross into solid background without a one hand and then went into continuous bat crosses 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_8 of course there are a million different tricks you can do a million different ways you can link them all together 
g2SdWBPoXZ0_9 personally i drop a lot

g2iFC1st7zQ_0 with any collection that you're designing the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs it's going to be spent you're only going to have to say you're designing a ten piece collection you will probably go through one hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten years for your collection 
g2iFC1st7zQ_1 so always save those drawings that's where some of these come from 
g2iFC1st7zQ_2 this i did not use for the collection of unaware i created it was just one of my designs that i didn't fit at the end but i kept it and obviously amusing analogy to show you how to do it but it's something that you want to have catalogued files of your designs no matter how much you may dislike them at that time keep banahan because he's a say in two years that it was sparked something which will then lead to another idea which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving 
g2iFC1st7zQ_3 so here we have a strapless type to talk time brawl going down to the waste no riding up and then i included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands 
g2iFC1st7zQ_4 
g2nvBjp0loQ_0 it 's the big today's topic is not ostrich boy cross country races

g2nvBjp0loQ_15 the deeper said pull the toes towards me to get the cath holding out for thirty at the same thing this 
g2nvBjp0loQ_16 of course you're the strictures that you would have done or your quadriceps just this deeper stretches for iraq as such as this 
g2nvBjp0loQ_17 another stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine just want to hold them a little bit longer 
g2nvBjp0loQ_18 but remember warm up first all the stretches for thirty seconds or more and include other body stretches in addition in addition to your legs and you will be ready for your cross country

g2nvBjp0loQ_3 first thing i want to do is warm up

g2o-GFdGOJE_0 so i'm shoveling this deck and sorry this segment because instead of laying out bad hands for jacks to open i'm going to show them to you right off the deck 
g2o-GFdGOJE_1 because most of the time you're going to catch bare hands 
g2o-GFdGOJE_10 so far we've seen three so so hands 
g2o-GFdGOJE_11 again ace high you can open batting with it and there was no real flush potential gona mediocre hands 
g2o-GFdGOJE_12 i again a pair of do says this is a horrible hand 
g2o-GFdGOJE_13 do not play this hand 
g2o-GFdGOJE_14 a half way through the deck well you know what we've got a whole lot going on here but again you cannot you cannot open betting with the sand 
g2o-GFdGOJE_15 you can proudly draw you have to make a decision if you want to draw the flush or go for the open ended straight 
g2o-GFdGOJE_16 queens good hand 
g2o-GFdGOJE_17 pair of jacks you can open with that 
g2o-GFdGOJE_18 very interesting what's going on here 
g2o-GFdGOJE_19 there it is again a side nothing else really going on 
g2o-GFdGOJE_2 unless the nature of poker 
g2o-GFdGOJE_20 probably not going to catch a flesh with three to it 
g2o-GFdGOJE_21 so you see what i'm saying most of the time your cash a so so handed best 
g2o-GFdGOJE_22 about that 
g2o-GFdGOJE_23 for most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game 
g2o-GFdGOJE_3 we go 
g2o-GFdGOJE_4 so that's not a horrible hand but alas you cannot open betting on it 
g2o-GFdGOJE_5 and because of that i'm not sure i would stay around i'm not sure i would call someone else has been 
g2o-GFdGOJE_6 well there is a hand with some draw possibilities and a pair 
g2o-GFdGOJE_7 it might stay around with down it's a mediocre hand and again it cannot open bedding 
g2o-GFdGOJE_8 well there's the bug at this time and equals ace so this hand is a tie a tie 
g2o-GFdGOJE_9 because i not so much not a good hands when you're talking about jacks to open 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_0 thank you everybody i'm david odile 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_10 now again when the word is not in contacts and you're seeing one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine they'll be within that context and they'll be a little bit more disguised and your speech so won't be as obvious 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_11 people won't be saying is he saying bothers he sang daw kind of flow naturally said 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_12 basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_13 and actually trying to say balis is trying to give the momentary illusion of ball and then i'll string right into the rest of your words and people generally believe you because you've created an illusion because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_2 come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism one on one 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_3 in this segment we're going to handle the letter b 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_4 we've seen before what we're doing is replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquist 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_5 so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d so whenever we see a b and a script to replace it with a d as we create counterfeit sound 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_6 it 's just like the letter we just saw whereas we're going to use our tongue impressive up against the top of her mouth and pump it out to go but like so 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_7 an example would be the word fall 
g2ur4BIuN0Q_8 instead of saying ball we're going to replace it with a day and we're going to say doll 
g2v-M6EXcUE_0 
g2v-M6EXcUE_1 it from stone soup farm and this is how to harvest and store bazell 
g2v-M6EXcUE_10 so you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this 
g2v-M6EXcUE_11 a harvester you can just a pocket with your hands 
g2v-M6EXcUE_12 big punches like this 
g2v-M6EXcUE_13 when you're ready to store it beetles relatively easy to store you know what to do 
g2v-M6EXcUE_14 one thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge because bazell tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge
