ted_00199_0014190_0026990 by name as art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my love of math and magic to do something i call mathemagics but before i get started i have a quick question for the audience 
ted_00199_0026990_0032430 by any chance did anyone happened to bring with them this morning a calculator 
ted_00199_0033190_0038410 seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand raise your hand i was hanging 
ted_00199_0038880_0043410 bring bring it out bring it out anybody else i see i see one way in the back

ted_00199_0058505_0058705 
ted_00199_0058630_0066010 now since i haven't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly 
ted_00199_0066230_0071390 with somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number please 
ted_00199_0071390_0072650 how about a two digit number 
ted_00199_0073810_0076080 twenty two and another two digit number sir 
ted_00199_0076360_0076650 
ted_00199_0076880_0082210 multiply two thousand and two times forty seven make sure you get one thousand and thirty four or the calculators are now 
ted_00199_0082210_0083190 working to all of you 
ted_00199_0083190_0084530 one thousand and thirty four 
ted_00199_0084860_0089940 one thousand and thirty four five ninety four let's give three and i'm a nice round 
ted_00199_0089890_0090090 seven 
ted_00199_0090040_0106030 applaud their would you like to try and more standard calculator just in case ok great what i'm going to try and do them i noticed that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's okay i'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster 
ted_00199_0106030_0112380 from the calculator there's something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying 
ted_00199_0112380_0114240 it by itself for instance five 
ted_00199_0114250_0114920 squared 
ted_00199_0114920_0127340 be quantified now the way we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one is by taking the numbers such as five hitting times and then equals and on most calculators that will give 
ted_00199_0127340_0133240 the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do 
ted_00199_0133240_0143030 calculation even faster when i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head for two digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators even use 
ted_00199_0143030_0160380 a shortcut method uses the second row for a view one two three four th yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and a few square the second the third and the fourth i will try and ratio to the answer okay so quickly 
ted_00199_0160380_0160930 imagine numbers 
ted_00199_0160930_0162590 please thirty seven 
ted_00199_0162600_0162980 squared 
ted_00199_0162980_0164830 ok 
ted_00199_0164830_0168770 twenty three squared ok fifty nine square 
ted_00199_0168770_0169380 ok

ted_00199_0181260_0188810 a very much let me try to take this 
ted_00199_0188820_0192450 one step further going to try to square some three digit 
ted_00199_0192450_0196900 numbers this time i won't even write these down i'll just call them out as their quality 
ted_00199_0196900_0199060 to me anyone i point to call out 
ted_00199_0199070_0201380 three digit number anyone on our panel 
ted_00199_0201540_0203600 and verify the answer just give some indication 
ted_00199_0203600_0204610 if it's a three digit 
ted_00199_0204640_0206420 a number 
ted_00199_0206420_0208240 nine eighty seven 
ted_00199_0208240_0208530 squared 
ted_00199_0208530_0215720 one thousand nine hundred and seventy four thousand one hundred and sixty nine yet another 
ted_00199_0216280_0229300 another three digit another era another three digit number sir for fifty seven sport has two hundred and five thousand eight hundred and forty nine to zero five eight for nine yet another 
ted_00199_0229820_0242500 digit number sir three twenty one is one hundred and three thousand and forty one one zero three zero for one yeah well more three digit number plate seven two thousand and two

ted_00199_0269810_0276130 with try to square a four digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not lead you to the answer on this 
ted_00199_0276130_0281080 one but i will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more random let's take out 
ted_00199_0281080_0286750 fourth row this time would say one two three four if each of you acquire a single digits between zero and nine 
ted_00199_0287090_0287340 
ted_00199_0287305_0287505 
ted_00199_0287420_0287620 below 
ted_00199_0287570_0296610 before digit number that i'll square nine seven five eight nine thousand and five acres will take a 
ted_00199_0296610_0296810 a little 
ted_00199_0296770_0296970 but it 
ted_00199_0296990_0298080 sometimes so bear with me 
ted_00199_0298360_0298830 one thousand nine 
ted_00199_0299560_0319860 million two hundred and eighteen thousand five hundred and sixty four thank you very much now i would attempt to square 
ted_00199_0319870_0320100 
ted_00199_0320110_0323100 five digit number and i can be 
ted_00199_0323130_0329660 unfortunately most calculators cannot eight legged capacity don't you 
ted_00199_0329660_0331820 bad so sensitive 
ted_00199_0331820_0332820 we reached the limit 
ted_00199_0332820_0334310 calculators with that 
ted_00199_0335670_0339120 as years go go higher 
ted_00199_0342490_0345930 talk to you later in the meanwhile let me conclude 
ted_00199_0345950_0348110 for the first part of my show by doing something 
ted_00199_0348110_0351110 a little trickier let's take the largest number 
ted_00199_0351110_0362900 billboard here a fix for nine with huge enter that on your calculator and instead of squaring at this time i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but don't tell me what 
ted_00199_0362910_0368470 we are multiplying by just multiplied by any random three digit number so you should have 
ted_00199_0368470_0371220 and the answer either a six digit or probably 
ted_00199_0371250_0372450 seven digit number 
ted_00199_0373090_0373720 he didn't 
ted_00199_0373730_0383030 we have six or seven seven and yours seven seven and uncertain seven is there any 
ted_00199_0383030_0383780 possible way 
ted_00199_0383755_0383955 with 
ted_00199_0383920_0387520 it could know what seven digit numbers you have say no 
ted_00199_0387880_0396510 then i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable what i'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any fix 
ted_00199_0396510_0396760 words 
ted_00199_0396760_0402840 seven digits any six of them in any order you'd like one digit 
ted_00199_0402840_0407460 time i shall try and determine the digit you've left out so starting 
ted_00199_0407460_0409080 with your seven digit number sonicwall 
ted_00199_0409100_0413120 seventy six of them please 
ted_00199_0416060_0418800 we leave out the number six good ok that's one 
ted_00199_0418800_0419990 seven seven digit number 
ted_00199_0419990_0421660 but any six of them please

ted_00199_0634000_0637320 presentation with the gentlemen up here who had a 
ted_00199_0637500_0646280 a ten digit calculator where is he would you stand up ten digit guy okay well stand up

ted_00199_0653790_0662870 square in my head a five digit number requiring a ten digit calculator but to make my job more interesting for you 
ted_00199_0662870_0671180 well as for me i'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly here what 
ted_00199_0671180_0674850 going on in my mind while i do a calculation 
ted_00199_0674850_0688460 size now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician were not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week so i think we're ok 
ted_00199_0690240_0696420 so let's take a let's take a different row of people are starting with you 
ted_00199_0696420_0699600 get five digits one two three four this already 
ted_00199_0699600_0704750 in the row before you start with user one two three four five crowd a single digit now 
ted_00199_0704750_0704970 cbs 
ted_00199_0704970_0705230 
ted_00199_0705370_0705790 five 
ted_00199_0705800_0706130 fidgeting 
ted_00199_0706130_0706960 a number that i will 
ted_00199_0706970_0720650 try to square five seven six a three fifty seven thousand six hundred eighty three 
ted_00199_0720650_0726180 squared yuck let me let me explain to you how i'm going 
ted_00199_0726180_0729840 who attempt this problem going to break the problem down into three 
ted_00199_0729840_0739550 parts of the fifty seven thousand squared plus six hundred and eighty three squared plus fifty seven thousand kinds 
ted_00199_0740640_0743760 crimes to add all those numbers 
ted_00199_0743760_0746930 together and with any luck arrive at the 
ted_00199_0746930_0761270 cancer now let me recap thank you while i explain something else i know that you can use right hook for internet while 
ted_00199_0761270_0763480 believe calculation you might hear 
ted_00199_0763480_0769930 certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is 
ted_00199_0770040_0774330 phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me 
ted_00199_0774330_0777190 convert numbers into words i store them 
ted_00199_0777190_0780300 his words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds 
ted_00199_0780300_0781020 complicated 
ted_00199_0781050_0783130 it 's not just don't want you to think you're seeing 
ted_00199_0783130_0783470 something 
ted_00199_0783470_0790160 a lot of rain man here there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely not 
ted_00199_0790160_0803570 you want to talk to me about a d h d afterwards you can documented by the way one left instruction for my judges with the calculators ok you know who 
ted_00199_0803570_0814470 there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do don't tell me what the mistake is just say your close or something like 
ted_00199_0814470_0818210 that and i'll try and figure out the answer which can be pretty entertaining 
ted_00199_0818155_0818355 canada 
ted_00199_0818300_0825490 itself if however i am right whatever you do don't keep it to yourself making 
ted_00199_0825490_0828060 for sure everybody knows that i got the answer 
ted_00199_0828060_0831600 bright because this is my big finish okay so without any 
ted_00199_0831600_0840610 forestalling here we go i'll start the problem in the middle and fifty seven times sixty three now fifty sometimes sixty eight thirty four hundred plus 
ted_00199_0842590_0844430 seven hundred and sixty plus one seventy one 
ted_00199_0844690_0848160 found something more than thirty eight thousand and nine thirty one thirty eight thousand and nine 
ted_00199_0848365_0848565 beatable 
ted_00199_0848560_0855270 where to get seventy seven thousand eight sixty to seventy seven thousand eight sixty two becomes cookie efficient cookie fission and seventy seven thousand 
ted_00199_0855600_0882330 eight hundred and twenty two that seems right i'll go on cookie fission ok next thirty and fifty seven squared which three thousand two hundred and forty nine so i can say three billion take the two forty nine and they have to cookie to forty nine weeks but i carry coming to forty nine and they have to cookie to fifty plus seventy seven three hundred and twenty seven million fish and fish and ok finally we do thick eighty three square that seven hundred times 
ted_00199_0882330_0883500 for something weird 
ted_00199_0883500_0885850 four hundred and sixty six thousand and four eighty nine rubber 
ted_00199_0885850_0887080 if i needed rubber 
ted_00199_0887420_0888190 sixty six 
ted_02879_0012990_0021400 so my was trying to explain something to me about grandma when they grew up and i couldn't pay attention to her because i was five years old and i was petrified 
ted_02879_0021890_0024430 i had just seen the green lady 
ted_02879_0024870_0035260 about a week earlier i watch that movie godzilla the one about that huge lizard like the storming a major city and the thought of a green monster coming from he was stuck in my mind 
ted_02879_0035790_0044340 there i was at a table lower manhattan with my mom just staring her horns her muscles all of which is frightened 
ted_02879_0044350_0048320 i didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero 
ted_02879_0049010_0052400 so i decided to consult the google have a day 
ted_02879_0052325_0052525 applause 
ted_02879_0055420_0061630 my mother explained at the green lady is actually the statue of liberty and as she was waving immigrants in 
ted_02879_0062300_0081180 the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head was the fact that according to my long before us the green lady was actually brown brown like me and that she changed colors over the years now much like america 
ted_02879_0081220_0089540 another part that really is intriguing about this is that when she changed color she made me think about myself 
ted_02879_0090680_0095170 it all made sense to me because of the first generation american i was surrounded by immigrants 
ted_02879_0095170_0102250 in fact within my immediate social circle of the people who support me who enriched my life at least two are foreign born 
ted_02879_0103090_0109040 in my life as a us citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers and chances are so is yours 
ted_02879_0109490_0112740 there are more than forty million immigrants in the usa 
ted_02879_0113100_0118820 according to census data a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign born parents 
ted_02879_0119340_0124290 i know all these statistics because i study global migration patterns 
ted_02879_0124510_0130600 woman journalist and for the last few years i've been documenting the lives of us citizens who had lost people to deportation 
ted_02879_0131040_0133170 the numbers are enormous 
ted_02879_0133850_0142630 from two thousand and eight to two thousand and sixteen more than three million people were ordered removed that's the technical term for being deported 
ted_02879_0143300_0153020 isn't economic or political and psychological and an emotional cost to those deportations the moments when these circles are broken 
ted_02879_0153620_0157450 once asked a u s soldier why did you volunteer to fight this war 
ted_02879_0157450_0160400 and she told me because i'm proud to defend my country 
ted_02879_0160630_0175350 but i press in a really when you're on base and you hear bombs exploding in the distance and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured in that moment when you know you could be next what does my country 
ted_02879_0176720_0189700 she looked at me my country is my wife my family my friends my soldiers what she was telling me that my country's the collection of the strong relationships these social circles 
ted_02879_0190320_0194480 when the social circles are weakened a country itself is weaker 
ted_02879_0195190_0198500 we're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy 
ted_02879_0198790_0210670 rather than focusing on individuals we should focus on the circles around them because these are the people who are left behind the voters the taxpayers the ones who are suffering that loss 
ted_02879_0211140_0214260 and it's not just the children are deported who were impacted 
ted_02879_0214740_0217440 brothers and sisters were separated by borders 
ted_02879_0217670_0228830 classmates teachers law enforcement officers technologists scientists doctors were all scrambling to make sense of new realities when their social circles are broken 
ted_02879_0229810_0235860 these are the real lives behind all these statistics that dominate discussions about immigration policy 
ted_02879_0235860_0237290 we often think about them 
ted_02879_0237920_0238960 i'm trying to change that 
ted_02879_0239820_0243740 use just one of the real life stories and i had collected 
ted_02879_0244460_0245490 still haunts me 
ted_02879_0246410_0253600 i met ramon and his son in two thousand and sixteen the same year both of them were being ordered out of the country 
ted_02879_0254360_0274530 ramon was being deported to latin america while his son who was a sergeant u s military was being deployed deported deployed if you just look at ramones case it wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is 
ted_02879_0275210_0280680 but consider a son a us citizen defending a country that's vanished as fun 
ted_02879_0281440_0282950 social circles which key here 
ted_02879_0283970_0297570 it 's another example that illustrates this critical bonds a group of citizens in philadelphia were concerned about their jobs because the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked was an undocumented immigrants and immigration officials had picked him up 
ted_02879_0298140_0299290 rally behind him 
ted_02879_0299530_0303940 immigration law he argued he was too important to local community to be deported 
ted_02879_0304610_0309770 at the hearing they even submitted restaurant reviews restaurant reviews 
ted_02879_0310450_0320490 in the end a judge exercise what's called judicial discretion and allow him to stay in the country but only because they considered the social circle 
ted_02879_0321520_0328270 there are twenty three million non citizens in the usa according to verifiable federal data 
ted_02879_0328270_0333830 that doesn't include the undocumented because numbers of that population are at best a complex estimates 
ted_02879_0333830_0335750 delicious work with what we have 
ted_02879_0336300_0344940 twenty three million social circles about one hundred million individuals whose lives can be impacted by deportation 
ted_02879_0345390_0348350 the stress of it all this trickling down to the population 
ted_02879_0349140_0366660 in two thousand and seventeen pole by u c l l a county residents found that thirty percent of citizens in l a county or stressed about deportation not because they themselves can be removed but rather because members of their social circle were at risk 
ted_02879_0367790_0371500 i am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported don't confuse name 
ted_02879_0372310_0376300 but what i am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture 
ted_02879_0377590_0385070 if you are within the sound of my voice i want you to close your eyes for a moment and examine your own social circle 
ted_02879_0385810_0387270 we are foreign born 
ted_02879_0387950_0391470 what would it feel like if the circle were broken 
ted_02879_0392430_0406260 share your story and building a global archive of first person accounts and linking them with mapping technology so that we can see exactly where the circles break because this is not just an american issue 
ted_02879_0406740_0413680 there are a quarter billion migrants around the world people living loving and learning in countries where they were not born 
ted_02879_0414080_0419190 my career and my life i've been one of them in china in africa in europe 
ted_02879_0419720_0436530 each time i become one of these foreigners one of the strange looking guy he's in a new land i can't help but think back to that day when i was in lower manhattan with my mom all those decades ago when i was scared and i had just spotted that green late 
ted_02879_0437560_0467580 i guess the question that i keep on thinking about when i see her and all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown and even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning as quite green when i look at all of that the question that my research seeks to answer becomes to me the same one that confounded me all those years ago you see a monster or a hero 
ted_02879_0469240_0472780 banking 
ted_02879_0472750_0472950 
ted_03631_0012550_0028820 seven years ago i found myself high than in a festival toilet a music festival toilet and if anyone being to music festival yet you'll know that by the third day is pretty nasty 
ted_03631_0029160_0037790 diamond and in the toilet because i couldn't even sit down because the toilet roll it ran out there with mud everywhere and smelled pretty bad 
ted_03631_0038080_0040940 i stood there thinking what am i doing 
ted_03631_0040970_0042460 i don't even need to totally left 
ted_03631_0042910_0062170 but the reason i went with because island volunteer and for a large charity on climate justice and it was seven years ago when lots of people didn't believe in climate change people are very cynical about act with them and my role with all my team mates with to get people to sign petitions on climate justice and educate them a bit more about the issue 
ted_03631_0062610_0082530 i care deeply about climate change and lots of inequality so i go and i talked a lot of people which made me nervous and drained me of energy but i did it because i had what i would hide in the toilet because i'd be exhausted and i didn't want my teammates down and my commitment to the cause thing 
ted_03631_0083450_0092680 we go and meet at the end of our shift and we count how many petitions had been signed and often i'd when the amount of petition find even though i had my little breaks in the toilet 
ted_03631_0093210_0109490 but i was always very jealous of the other activists because either they had the same amount of energy as i had when they began to shift of getting people to sign petitions or often they had more energy and then be really excited about going to watch the band in the evening and have done 
ted_03631_0109800_0122670 even if i loved the band's all i wanted to do was to go back to my hands and half asleep because i just feel completely wiped out and i was really jealous of people have the energy to get one party hard at the festival 
ted_03631_0123690_0126660 but it also made me really angry as while inside 
ted_03631_0126680_0137210 i thought this isn't fair i'm an incorrect and all of that offline campaign and seems to be favor an extra that i would go on marches which training 
ted_03631_0137210_0138210 the other option 
ted_03631_0138250_0142600 go and join in campaigns outside embassies or shops 
ted_03631_0142940_0150690 but the only thing that with an affair with around lots of people it was very loud activism always involved lots of people it was performing 
ted_03631_0150970_0169700 and non event with their introverts and i not only thought that that wasn't fair because a third to a half of the world's population introvert which isn't fair on them because we'd ban out all would be put off by activism and not do it i'm everyone needs to be an actress in this world 
ted_03631_0170430_0179080 and also i didn't think it was particularly clever but i could see a lot of the activism that worked wasn't only extrovert activism 
ted_03631_0179080_0180860 it wasn't only the loud 
ted_03631_0180860_0183490 it wasn't about people perform and all the time 
ted_03631_0183750_0188150 i love the work that was needed within the background with hidden wasn't theme 
ted_03631_0189030_0222790 when i ended up just be in a campaign i couldn't see any job i can do really i was campaign and a university and for the last ten years i've been a professional campaigner for large charities and now i'm a creative campaigner consultants for different charities as well as other work i do but i knew that there were other forms of activism that when needed i started tinkering about seven years ago to see what quieter forms of activism i could engage with that i didn't pan out as an activist but also to look at some of the issues i was concerned about and campaign 
ted_03631_0223010_0236060 it was very lucky that when i worked for oxfam and make charities that i could read lots of big reports on what influenced politicians and businesses and general public what campaigns worked really well which didn't 
ted_03631_0236060_0254130 become a bit of a geek so i look at all of that stuff and i wanted to tinker around to see how i could engage people in social change in a different way because i think that if we want the world to me more beautiful kind and just than our activism should be beautiful kind and just and often it now 
ted_03631_0254740_0259300 today i just want to talk about three ways i think activism needs in tibet 
ted_03631_0259600_0262360 i think there's lots of other ways but i'm just gonna talk about three 
ted_03631_0263720_0283170 fast line is activism is often very quick and it's about doing so extra that often their immediate response to injustices we've got to do stuff now we've got to react really quickly and yes we do need to react but we need to be strategic in our campaign and and if we just act on anger often we do the wrong thing 
ted_03631_0284160_0298390 i use craft like needle whack like this guy behind me stolen as a way to not any slowed down those extra that day with but also to bring gain nervous quiet in tibet into activism 
ted_03631_0299200_0304350 why do and repetitive actions like handicraft he can't do it fast you have to do it slowly 
ted_03631_0304570_0320380 repetitive stitches help you meditate on the big complex messy social change issues and figure out what we can do as well as a citizen as the consumer as a constituent and all of those different things 
ted_03631_0320410_0325650 it helps you think critically while you're away and it helps you be more mindful of what do 
ted_03631_0326380_0329650 that bobby a whack it was mentioned before 
ted_03631_0329930_0335490 you about joined them people in solidarity or do you want to be the saviour which often isn't very ethical 
ted_03631_0335810_0356780 but do a needle work together as well extra vets and invent an army that everyone's on a scale in different places because it took a quiet slow former activism it really helps into that we had in the ways in other areas where they are often not have so because 
ted_03631_0356950_0361470 but while you itch and you don't need eye contact with people 
ted_03631_0361910_0376180 sofa nervous into that it means that you can sit next to someone or a group of people i'm asked questions that you're thinking that often at time to ask people owner too nervous to ask if you give to my contacts 
ted_03631_0376500_0404410 so you can get intervention with those big deep thinkers and that's really interested in you want to do that extra form of activism and it's about shame and people or quickly go out somewhere but who he tried to target and how is the best way to do it so it means you can have these discussions in a very slow way which is great for the extra bed to slow down and think deeply but it's really good for the end of act as well to be had and feel part of that movement for change and a good way 
ted_03631_0404750_0413750 some ways we do to stitch cards about what values we threads that a lot activism and making sure that we don't just react in unethical ways 
ted_03631_0413810_0426890 one sometimes we work with our institutions where it will get over one hundred and fifty people in the dna who can come for hours to stitch together on a particular issue and then tweets what they think i know how it went like this one 
ted_03631_0427710_0433900 also i always think that activate them needs introverts because we're really good at intimate activism 
ted_03631_0434190_0454900 couldn't slow activism and we're really good at intimate act with them and if this year's told us anything it's told us that we need to when we're engaged in power holders we need to engage them by listening to people we disagree with by building bridges not was walls are laws and by being critical friends not aggressive enemies 
ted_03631_0455390_0468200 one example that i do a lot with introverts but with lots of people is make gifts for people in power should not be outside scream and them but could give them something like a bespoke handkerchief saying don't lie way 
ted_03631_0468430_0469690 fusion power for good 
ted_03631_0469960_0486740 we know you've got a difficult job in your position of power how can we help you and what's great is for the into that we can write letters while we're making these gifts thrills marks and spencer we tried to campaign to get them to implement the living wage 
ted_03631_0486790_0489210 so he made them all the board members fourteen 
ted_03631_0490990_0500510 we wrote them letters we bucks them up and we went to the age yam to hand deliver our gifts and have that form of income activism where we had discussions with them 
ted_03631_0501100_0507740 what was brilliant with the chairman of the boards told us how amazed and our campaign was how heartfelt it was 
ted_03631_0508160_0538940 the board members like mark a lane fox who has hundreds and thousands of followers on twitter and highly influential in business tweeted impress she wants and within ten months we had meetings with marks and spencer to say we know this is difficult to be eleven wage employer but if you can be won the rest of the sector will look at it and it's not right that some of your amazed and whack whack and full time and still can't pay their bills and we look marks and spencer is how can you be the road muddled that we want you to be 
ted_03631_0538940_0541830 so intimate form of activism 
ted_03631_0541840_0543920 we had lots of meetings with meet with them 
ted_03631_0544140_0558730 we then gave them christmas cards and valentines gods decided we really want to encourage you to implement and live in wage and within ten months they denounce to the media that they were going to pay the independent living wage and now 
ted_03631_0559965_0560165 applause 
ted_03631_0560045_0560245 
ted_03631_0561750_0587040 now we're trying to work with them to be accredited which is really important and we went back to the last day of yemenis june and we had these amaze and one to one discussions with the board members he told us how much they love their hankies and how it rarely move them what we were doing and they all told us that if he was standing outside scream at them and not be in gentle and protest they wouldn't have even listen to us never mind has these discussions with us 
ted_03631_0587310_0608060 internet some really good at intimate activism because we like to listen we light one ones we don't like small talks like those big juicy issues to discuss with people we don't like conflict so we avoid at all costs which is really important when we're trying to engage power holders not to be conflict and with all the time 
ted_03631_0608640_0626390 that 's why i think activists are really really miss out if they don't engage in tibet is the introverts like i said can be half of the world's population and may still as won't say that we're introverts are we get embarrassed by science was overwhelmed 
ted_03631_0626640_0643220 so for me a few years ago my mum used to semi texts in capital letters and she can now do images and everything she's fine but as soon as i see this tech and when i think oh it's capital is it's too much and i'd have to ignore it to be the lovely kept sheath and me 
ted_03631_0643560_0655770 that has been embarrassing to tell people that capital letters overwhelm you but we really need internet the helpers to intriguing activism that attracts them rather than puts them off 
ted_03631_0655830_0664850 we put off by big and brush giant posters in capital letters an exclamation marks countless what to do and vying for our attention 
ted_03631_0665320_0675980 some of the things i do with people around the world who take part is make small bits of provocative street art which are hung a high level very small and their provocative messages 
ted_03631_0675990_0678820 cannot preach and people are telling them what to do 
ted_03631_0679280_0684830 just getting people to engage in different ways and think for themselves because we don't like to be told what to do 
ted_03631_0685860_0701110 it might be wearing a green heart on your sleeve say and what you love and how climate change will affect day and will wear and if people say why are you wearing a green heart with the workshop clown and we can have these onto one intimate conversations and say i love chocolate 
ted_03631_0701430_0717040 climate change is going to effect day and i think there's lots of things that climate change will affect and i really want to make sure i'm part of the solution not the problem and then we normally to flex because we don't like to be center of attention and sidewalk to you love and how the climate change effects 
ted_03631_0718050_0727040 it might be shut drop in instead of shoplift and where will make little many scrolls were lovely stories on about what's the story behind your clothes 
ted_03631_0727090_0730620 a joyful story of how it's made or a tortuous one 
ted_03631_0731080_0741660 struck them and little pockets and shops all lower case all handwritten with kisses and smiley faces in robin and then people are excited that they found it 
ted_03631_0742140_0757570 we often drop him an unethical shop or in people in front pocket and it's a way that we can do offline campaign and that engages all the band is out but also engages people and intrigued and white online and offline 
ted_03631_0759020_0764710 so i've got to call to action for the internet and the extra bed 
ted_03631_0765200_0767890 the new that you're involved an old way 
ted_03631_0769030_0775400 with the extra that i want to say that when you're planning a campaign think about introverts 
ted_03631_0775510_0779640 think about how valuable skills are just as much as extra bed 
ted_03631_0779990_0785900 we 're good at slowing down and think and deeply and the detail of issues that really good at bringing in the mouth 
ted_03631_0786660_0790310 what good an intimate activism so users in that way 
ted_03631_0791120_0797270 could the intrigue and people by doing strange little things that help create conversations 
ted_03631_0797970_0807970 for that my calls for action for you is i know you like the and on your own i know you've been in your head but activism knee jew sometimes you've got to get out 
ted_03631_0808660_0820280 it doesn't mean that you've got a pan into an extra that and burnout because that's no use for anyone but what it does mean is that you should value the skills and the traits that you have the activities will need 
ted_03631_0820820_0831360 so for our industry where you in that spirit or an internet or an avenue that the world needs now more than ever and you've got no excuse not to get involved 
ted_03631_0831900_0832240 bank 
ted_03631_0832240_0841340 
ted_00404_0012060_0018300 i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature 
ted_00404_0018640_0034500 so i had my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation that as looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning and then following it up and try to understand 
ted_00404_0034800_0038480 one of the questions that i asked you when you look around what do you see 
ted_00404_0038930_0050590 well you see the space that's created by designers and by then the work of people but what you actually see a lot of material that was already here being reshaped and a certain form 
ted_00404_0050920_0054010 so the question is how did that material get here 
ted_00404_0054230_0057160 how did they get into the form it had before it got reshape and so forth 
ted_00404_0057630_0060190 it's a question of what's the continuity 
ted_00404_0060190_0063920 one of the things i look at is how did the universe began and shape 
ted_00404_0064180_0069600 what was the whole process and the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kind of material 
ted_00404_0069860_0076000 so that's sort of apart and let me move on then show you the hubble ultra deep field 
ted_00404_0076230_0081630 if you look at this picture what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it 
ted_00404_0082180_0085960 everything but for these objects are stars and you can see them their little pluses 
ted_00404_0086240_0090910 this is a star this is a star everything else was a galaxy 
ted_00404_0091650_0094870 a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye on here 
ted_00404_0095190_0114670 when i look out and particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if there's an art design college conference going on and an intelligent beings they are thinking about what designs i might do and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and they might even be some on that galaxy looking at hours trying to figure out what's going on over here 
ted_00404_0115140_0122140 but there's a lot of other galaxies in summer nearby and they're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and though there are a little bluer and so forth 
ted_00404_0122440_0126970 but one of the questions is that should be to you how can there are so many galaxies 
ted_00404_0127200_0129570 because this represents a very tiny fraction of the sky 
ted_00404_0129860_0130360 is only 
ted_00404_0130750_0139950 biologists we think there's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if he had the time the scattered around about one hundred billion galaxies it's a very large number 
ted_00404_0141170_0143700 that's abruptly how many stars they're on our own galaxy 
ted_00404_0143950_0148720 but when you look at some of these regions like this you'll see more galaxies and stars which is kind of a conundrum 
ted_00404_0148770_0158360 so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that 
ted_00404_0158610_0160780 then i'm going to tell you it's actually a lot more complicated 
ted_00404_0161360_0162750 we're going to try and follow it up 
ted_00404_0162900_0171540 we have a tool that actually helps us out in the study and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine and a certain sense 
ted_00404_0171660_0174810 we draw the set of nested spheres cutaway sixty 
ted_00404_0175040_0178890 put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that's where we're making observations 
ted_00404_0179170_0184870 when the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary like the moon two seconds ago and who cares 
ted_00404_0184920_0188290 few seconds like the present the scientists eight minutes ago 
ted_00404_0188300_0191920 but that's not such a big deal unless a solar flares coming you want to get out of the way 
ted_00404_0192160_0193470 if you'd like to have advanced 
ted_00404_0193720_0197140 but you get out the jupiter and its forty minutes away it's a problem 
ted_00404_0197140_0201640 about mars it's a problem communicating to mars because it takes a long enough to go there 
ted_00404_0201970_0207590 but if you look at the nearest set of stars so the nearest forty or fifty stars it's about ten years 
ted_00404_0207720_0210610 take a picture of what's going on it's ten years ago 
ted_00404_0210890_0213900 what you go and looked at the center of the galaxy is thousands of years ago 
ted_00404_0214140_0218110 we look at andromeda which is the nearest big galaxy and as two million years ago 
ted_00404_0218380_0223340 if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there would be no evidence of humans at all because we don't think they were humans yet 
ted_00404_0223400_0225120 it gives you the scale 
ted_00404_0225730_0229850 with the hubble space telescope were looking out hundreds of millions of years two billion years 
ted_00404_0230150_0247280 but if we were capable to come up with an idea how to look even further to send things even further and that was what i did a lot of my work was to develop the techniques that we could look out back even earlier epochs before they were star than before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different 
ted_00404_0247510_0252030 so that's the sort of sequence and so i have a more artistic impression of this 
ted_00404_0252260_0259710 whereas the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way and around that are the hubble nearby galaxies and there's a sphere that marks the different times 
ted_00404_0259940_0262270 behind that are some more modern galaxies 
ted_00404_0262320_0263500 we see the whole big picture 
ted_00404_0263760_0266780 in the beginning of time it's funny it's on the outside 
ted_00404_0267220_0271810 then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot light cannot escape 
ted_00404_0271940_0276330 fletke can't see that the center of the sun you'd have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside of the sun 
ted_00404_0276630_0279640 but you can see the edge of the sun and the universe gets that way you can see that 
ted_00404_0279940_0288750 then you see this sort of model area around the outside and that is the radiation coming from the big bang which is actually incredibly uniform 
ted_00404_0289050_0295950 the universe is almost a perfect sphere but there are these very tiny variations which we show here and create exaggeration 
ted_00404_0296280_0307070 from them and the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and stars to these more advanced galaxies and eventually the solar systems and software 
ted_00404_0307420_0312260 so it's a big design job but we will see about how things are going on 
ted_00404_0312580_0317930 so the way this measurements were done it's been a set of satellites and this is where you get to see 
ted_00404_0318240_0323290 so there was the kogi satellite which was launched in one hundred and eighty nine and we discover these variations 
ted_00404_0323350_0329150 then in two thousand the map satellite was launched the w map and made somewhat better pictures 
ted_00404_0329500_0340940 later this year this is the cool stealth version the one that actually has some beautiful design teachers to it and they said that the planck satellite will be launched and it will make very high resolution maps 
ted_00404_0341160_0344870 that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe 
ted_00404_0345200_0356850 what we saw it as we saw these variations and then they told us the secrets both about the structure of space time and about the contents of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motion 
ted_00404_0356940_0366140 so we have this picture which is quite spectacular picture and i'll come back to the beginning where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning 
ted_00404_0366390_0380960 we go through a period of accelerating expansion and the universe expands and cools and so it gets to the point where it becomes transparent that into the dark ages and then the first stars turn on and they evolve into galaxies and later they get to the more expansive galaxies 
ted_00404_0381190_0384160 somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming 
ted_00404_0384450_0386980 and it's maturing up to the present time 
ted_00404_0387300_0388530 since protect your things 
ted_00404_0388530_0397100 wastebasket part that's the represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period and so this is a pretty weird model 
ted_00404_0397830_0399680 what kind of evidence we have for that 
ted_00404_0399990_0403540 so let me show you some of nature's patterns that a result of this 
ted_00404_0403560_0416670 i always think of space time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and stars just like the film on the ocean it's a marker of where they were the interesting ways are and whatever went out 
ted_00404_0416760_0422890 so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location of a million galaxies 
ted_00404_0423390_0424880 dot on here for every galaxy 
ted_00404_0425130_0443540 go out and when a telescope at the sky take a picture identify what are stars and throw them away look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are and plot them up and just put radially they're going out that way and you see these structures this thing we call the great wall and but there are voids and those kind of stuff and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it 
ted_00404_0443830_0446370 i'm going to show you this in three d 
ted_00404_0446630_0450380 what happens is you take pictures of the earth rotates should get a fan across the sky 
ted_00404_0450730_0456240 some places you can't look because of our own galaxy or because there are no telescopes available to do it 
ted_00404_0456470_0460400 so the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around 
ted_00404_0460400_0463470 and you see the fan like scans made across the sky 
ted_00404_0463800_0473340 remember every spot on here is a galaxy and you see the galaxies you know sort of in our neighborhood and you start to see the structure 
ted_00404_0473550_0478520 when you see this thing we call the great wall and you see the complicated structure and you see these boys 
ted_00404_0478520_0484070 there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together 
ted_00404_0484090_0488470 so there's an interesting pattern but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern 
ted_00404_0488600_0490250 we only have a million galaxies 
ted_00404_0490250_0494310 keeping like a million balls in the air but you know what's going on 
ted_00404_0494470_0501330 but there's another survey which is very similar this call it the tedious the two degree field of view galaxy redshift survey 
ted_00404_0501600_0504590 going to fly through it at warp a million 
ted_00404_0505350_0516290 every time there's a galaxy and its location there's a galaxy and we know if we know anything about the galaxy which you do it because there's a redshift measurement everything you put it in the type of galaxy and the color so this is the real representation 
ted_00404_0516550_0520770 when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern it's like being in the middle of life 
ted_00404_0520770_0523280 it 's hard to see the middle of the audience and started to see the pattern of 
ted_00404_0523690_0526800 so we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this 
ted_00404_0529040_0545020 you will see the first the structure of the survey that you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here 
ted_00404_0545250_0554390 but you can see the voyage you can see that the complicated structure and you say well how did this happen right suppose you're the catholic designer 
ted_00404_0554670_0556940 how are you going to put galaxies out there and a pattern like that 
ted_00404_0556940_0558370 it's not just throwing them out at random 
ted_00404_0558690_0560870 a more complicated process going on here 
ted_00404_0561190_0562830 how are you going to end up doing that 
ted_00404_0563270_0566000 so now we're in for some serious play 
ted_00404_0566210_0571190 we have to seriously play god not just change people's lives but make the universe 
ted_00404_0571190_0573850 so if that's your responsibility how are you going to do that 
ted_00404_0574090_0575200 what's the kind of techniques 
ted_00404_0575200_0593230 with the kind of thing going to do so i'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that that humans have labor so hard to pick up but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning 
ted_00404_0593640_0602960 and that is you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules and that you have to have enough ingredients to make a complicated 
ted_00404_0603290_0611530 then you put in some randomness and fluctuations of the randomness and realize a whole bunch of different representations 
ted_00404_0611790_0615840 so what i'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales 
ted_00404_0615840_0623000 we're going to zoom in that this is a platter of what it is and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right 
ted_00404_0623410_0630270 dark matter that is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way the ordinary matter does the way that light shining on me or on the stage 
ted_00404_0630650_0638540 it's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we're going to make it white so the stuff that in this picture that's white that it is the dark matter 
ted_00404_0638580_0641060 it should be called invisible matter of the dark matter made visible 
ted_00404_0641380_0648240 stuff that is in the yellow color that is the ordinary matter it's turned into stars and galaxies 
ted_00404_0648140_0656430 so i'll show you the next movie so this we're going to zoom in and notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern 
ted_00404_0656710_0658160 we're going to zoom in and zoom in 
ted_00404_0659960_0663310 you'll see they're all these filaments and structures and voids 
ted_00404_0663390_0668790 when a not a number of filaments come together and no not that makes a supercluster of galaxies 
ted_00404_0668850_0673380 one we're zooming in on the somewhere between one hundred thousand and a million galaxies and small 
ted_00404_0673380_0680730 region so we live in the boonies we don't live in the center of the solar system we don't live in center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of 
ted_00404_0683220_0692480 this is a region which probably has more than one hundred thousand on the order of a million galaxies in that region we're going to keep zooming in and so i forgot to tell you 
ted_00404_0692480_0696330 scale parsec as three point two six 
ted_00404_0697020_0700090 so a gigaparsec says three billion light years that's the scale 
ted_00404_0700310_0702890 so it takes light three billion years to travel over that 
ted_00404_0703240_0705780 an hour into the distance between here and here 
ted_00404_0706300_0708210 between us and andromeda right 
ted_00404_0708570_0710930 these little specks that you're seeing their galaxies 
ted_00404_0713590_0725920 we're going to zoom back out and you can see this this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations 
ted_00404_0725920_0727530 simple building block 
ted_00404_0727980_0729720 it 's a very simple fluid that begin with 
ted_00404_0729730_0739970 it got dark matter that ordinary matter it's got photons and it's got neutrinos which don't play much role in the later part of the universe 
ted_00404_0740050_0746300 and it's just a simple fluid and it into overtime develops into this complicated structure 
ted_00404_0746710_0752250 so now when you first saw this picture didn't mean quite so much to you 
ted_00404_0752590_0762920 here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies and nodes but you realize they're not even the main structure 
ted_00404_0762930_0768280 a framework which is the dark matter the invisible matter that's out there that's actually holding it altogether 
ted_00404_0768540_0774250 so let's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out 
ted_00404_0775130_0777550 so here's that same result 
ted_00404_0777930_0785170 a filament you see the light is invisible matter and a yellow as the stars and galaxies showing up 
ted_00404_0785550_0797760 and we're going to fly around and will fly around and you'll see some occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies and then we'll fly and wherever the very large clusters and you can see what it looks like 
ted_00404_0798230_0801910 so from inside it doesn't look very complicated 
ted_00404_0802200_0810980 only when you look at another really large scale and explored and so forth he realized it's a very intricate complicated kind of a design 
ted_00404_0811070_0815280 has grown up in a in some kind of way 
ted_00404_0815300_0821570 so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right 
ted_00404_0821580_0825850 how many have been contractor team would you need to put this universe together 
ted_00404_0825910_0828770 that's an issue 
ted_00404_0829240_0831360 so here we are 
ted_00404_0831380_0837650 we see how the filament you see how several filaments are coming together therefore making this the supercluster of galaxies 
ted_00404_0838560_0850830 when you have to understand this is not how it actually look at first you can't travel as fast but like everything will be distorted but this is using simple rendering graphic arts kind of stuff 
ted_00404_0850960_0854780 this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you 
ted_00404_0854830_0856260 you could see invisible matter too 
ted_00404_0857070_0864970 so the idea is you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way 
ted_00404_0865260_0876680 we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus or other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom 
ted_00404_0878560_0883560 it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations but expanding at a tremendous rate 
ted_00404_0884040_0891550 those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background 
ted_00404_0891920_0898080 then we need some way to turn those fluctuations and the galaxies and clusters of galaxies and to make these kind of structure go on 
ted_00404_0898350_0899990 so i'm going to show you a smaller simulation 
ted_00404_0899990_0910240 simulation was run on one thousand processors for a month in order to make just a simple visit one so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop and two days in the next 
ted_00404_0910240_0916050 picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller than 
ted_00404_0916580_0920810 you start seeing these networks this cosmic web structure forming 
ted_00404_0921040_0925300 this is a simple one because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just as the dark matter and 
ted_00404_0925570_0932310 when you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind so there it is 
ted_00404_0932420_0934000 but at the beginning it's very uniform 
ted_00404_0934250_0935740 fluctuations are a part of one hundred 
ted_00404_0936620_0942550 to a few peaks that are part of ten thousand and then over billions of years gravity just 
ted_00404_0942940_0948600 polls and there's a slight over density pulls the material around in that pulls and more material than it was 
ted_00404_0949570_0955790 but the distances on the universe is so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form 
ted_00404_0956080_0963650 it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size that is now and in terms of expansion 
ted_00404_0963940_0970750 at that point the universe mysteriously starts accelerating expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure 
ted_00404_0971010_0980120 so we're just seeing as large scale structure we can see and then the only things that are started forming already are going to form then from then on what's going to go on 
ted_00404_0980260_0986170 so we're able to this simulation but this is two days on a laptop and desktop 
ted_00404_0986470_0991360 we need thirty days on one thousand processors to do that kind of simulations show 
ted_00404_0991360_1027470 before so we have an idea of how to play seriously it created the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedropper material right and we create everything we can see in any direction from almost nothing that is something extremely tiny extremely small and it is almost perfect except that had these tiny fluctuations that apart one hundred thousand level which turn out that produced the interesting patterns and designed to see that as galaxies and stars 
ted_00404_1027470_1034600 before so we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs that what we think the universe really 
ted_00404_1035650_1040400 that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination of her was 
ted_00404_1040960_1056180 so this is what we started with fifteen years ago with the cosmic background explorer may made the map and the upper right which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales you can kind of see that 
ted_00404_1056200_1059580 since then we've had w map which gives us hiring a resolution 
ted_00404_1059750_1063000 we see the same large scale structure will we see additional small scale structure 
ted_00404_1063350_1070640 on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and map the earth what kind of map we've gotten the earth 
ted_00404_1070970_1075170 and you could see well you can kind of pick out a major continents but that's about it 
ted_00404_1075630_1086680 what we're hoping when we get the planck will have resolution about equivalent to the resolution of the earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth 
ted_00404_1086970_1092760 you can also tell because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together there's some non linear processes 
ted_00404_1093230_1097200 geology has these effects in which is moving the plates around and so forth 
ted_00404_1097410_1099100 you can see that just from the map alone 
ted_00404_1099370_1111960 we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move to modify and it gives us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments 
ted_00404_1112430_1116400 so that's where we are today and that that's what i wanted to give you a flavor 
ted_00404_1116690_1128540 it gives you a different view about what the design and whatever area where everything else looks like thank you 
ted_00644_0012720_0015340 clearly we are living in a moment of crisis 
ted_00644_0015470_0027200 arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there's probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive 
ted_00644_0027550_0029900 because some of the technologies we've been talking about 
ted_00644_0030240_0037560 because of the resources the skills and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world but the mindset to create change 
ted_00644_0038310_0049220 and we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world 
ted_00644_0049590_0056020 by definition every one of you who was in this room and must consider yourself a global for a global citizen 
ted_00644_0056510_0057870 work on the front line 
ted_00644_0057930_0062870 when you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another 
ted_00644_0063270_0071450 no matter what country you live or work in move off the thing the extraordinary thing of individuals are capable of even in the most ordinary now 
ted_00644_0072370_0080740 today there's a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty have that we release their energy 
ted_00644_0080830_0085770 on the one hand we have people that day the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out 
ted_00644_0086110_0090010 on the other we have people who say the problem is we need more aid 
ted_00644_0090320_0094090 want to talk about is something that complements both systems 
ted_00644_0094170_0095520 we call it patient capital 
ted_00644_0096080_0109340 the critic point to the five hundred billion dollars spent in africa thin nine hundred and seventy and say and what do we have it environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty rampant corruption 
ted_00644_0109350_0111540 and use mobuto as metaphor 
ted_00644_0112120_0122670 and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable focus on the capital markets in that don't give anything away 
ted_00644_0123350_0127060 if on the other side as i said there are those who say the problem is that we need more money 
ted_00644_0127650_0135870 when it comes to the rich will bail out my hand a lot of aid but when it comes to our poor brethren we want little to do with it 
ted_00644_0136260_0146590 pointed with exactly the way the eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and anti retroviral 
ted_00644_0146980_0148300 both sides are right 
ted_00644_0148880_0152150 the problem is that neither side of listening to the other 
ted_00644_0152390_0156080 even more problematic they're not listening to poor people themselves 
ted_00644_0156700_0168930 for twenty five years of working on issues of poverty and of innovation it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people 
ted_00644_0169610_0186210 must navigate market daily making micro decisions talented and dozens to move their way through society and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family they could be put back into poverty sometimes for generations 
ted_00644_0186510_0190220 we need both the market and we need aid 
ted_00644_0190810_0195700 patient capital works between and tries to take the best of both 
ted_00644_0196260_0214900 money invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and our building solutions to healthcare water housing alternative energy thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity but as individual customers consumers client people who want to make decisions in their own lives 
ted_00644_0215180_0232950 patient capital required that we have incredible tolerance for risk a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment to use the market will bear listening device that we have and the expectation of below market returns but outside social impact 
ted_00644_0234700_0245240 it recognizes that the market has its limitations and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people 
ted_00644_0245550_0248910 entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons 
ted_00644_0249520_0256660 first they tend to work in markets where people make one two three dollars a day and they're making all of their decisions within that income level 
ted_00644_0257130_0265480 second the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure no roads to speak of sporadic electricity in high levels of corruption 
ted_00644_0266750_0269370 third they are often creating market 
ted_00644_0269460_0274250 even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages it is something new 
ted_00644_0274520_0287930 so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time takes a lot of patience 
ted_00644_0288760_0292870 it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance 
ted_00644_0293070_0307010 and not only to build the systems the business model that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way but to connect those businesses to other market to governments to corporations real partnership if we want to get scared 
ted_00644_0308360_0312180 i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation 
ted_00644_0312530_0321700 in two thousand and two i met with incredible entrepreneur named omni cabot the dangling from india has been working for twenty years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet 
ted_00644_0322190_0332230 he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether despite the fact that two hundred million farmers alone in india and make under a dollar a day 
ted_00644_0333150_0341790 were creating subsidies either for large farms or they will giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use rather than that the farmers wanted to use 
ted_00644_0342280_0350200 but at the same time i'm macabre was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel 
ted_00644_0350420_0355010 it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stock of the plant 
ted_00644_0355310_0360100 it could transform swaths of desert land into fields with emerald green 
ted_00644_0360500_0369220 but the market also had bypassed low income farmers because the systems were both too expensive and they were constructed for fields that were too large 
ted_00644_0369490_0373380 the average smallholder farmer works on two acres or less 
ted_00644_0373840_0386160 so i decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves because he had spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have 
ted_00644_0386590_0388400 used three fundamental principles 
ted_00644_0388810_0403100 the first one with miniatures ization the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre even if he had to because it was too frightening given all that he had at stake 
ted_00644_0403530_0406650 second it had to be extremely affordable 
ted_00644_0407000_0414410 in other words that risk i'm a quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest or else they wouldn't take the risk 
ted_00644_0414860_0418840 third it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable 
ted_00644_0419600_0425570 what i mean it with the profits from the first quarter acre the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth 
ted_00644_0426180_0437560 today i e india army cabins organization has sold over three hundred thousand farmers these systems and have seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average but this didn't happen 
ted_00644_0437840_0454730 overnight in fact when you go back to the beginning there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk and building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that we're working in the riskiest sectors 
ted_00644_0456150_0457410 we needed grant 
ted_00644_0457470_0463680 youth significant grant to research to experiment to fail to innovate and try again 
ted_00644_0464130_0471760 when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers that one patient capital could come in 
ted_00644_0472110_0483360 we helped him build a company for profit that would build on either eat knowledge and start looking at fail and export and be able to tap into other kinds of capital 
ted_00644_0483750_0490180 secondarily we wanted to see if we can export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries 
ted_00644_0490260_0493780 and so we met doctor sono khangharani in pakistan 
ted_00644_0494180_0512380 while again you needed patient to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan just to get a permit over time we were able to start a company with with doctor sono who runs a large community development organization and the tar desert which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country 
ted_00644_0512820_0519130 that company has just started our assumption is that they are too will see the impact on millions 
ted_00644_0520100_0522600 but drip irrigation isn't the only innovation 
ted_00644_0522600_0525360 we're starting to feed the happening all around the world 
ted_00644_0525730_0536700 the aleutian tanzania aided that textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund to create a factory that now employs seven thousand people mostly 
ted_00644_0536700_0541400 women and they produce twenty million lifesaving bednets for africans around them 
ted_00644_0543640_0557380 bring hospital as a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality affordable and maternal health care the low income women have been sloth the federal building new hospital every thirty five day 
ted_00644_0560500_0580550 by an ambulance crew decided that it was going to we invent a completely broken industry building an ambulance service in bombay that would use the technology of google earth a sliding scale frightening them so that all people could have access and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption 
ted_00644_0580820_0586810 so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder and are now beginning to fail because of partnership 
ted_00644_0587100_0596190 save just one for government contracts to build up their one hundred ambulances and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in india 
ted_00644_0596950_0598580 idea fail is critical 
ted_00644_0598930_0602590 because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people 
ted_00644_0602590_0606250 of the one side effects have reached at least a quarter million people 
ted_00644_0606250_0607830 but that abruptly not enough 
ted_00644_0608140_0611490 where the idea of partnership becomes so important 
ted_00644_0611740_0622450 whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital market government itself or partner with major corporation there's unbelievable opportunity for innovation 
ted_00644_0623450_0632010 president obama understands that he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country and look at how we can scale 
ted_00644_0632280_0645050 i would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really had innovations not only for their country but ones that we can use in the developed world as well 
ted_00644_0645360_0649290 best financial assistance but also management assistance 
ted_00644_0649550_0655620 then measure the returns both from a financial perspective and social impact perspective 
ted_00644_0656680_0662300 when we think about new approaches to aid it's impossible not to talk about pakistan 
ted_00644_0663030_0670190 we kind of rocky relationship with that country and in all fairness the united states has not always been a very reliable partner 
ted_00644_0670680_0675600 but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things happen 
ted_00644_0676110_0698660 if we take that notion of a global innovation fund we could use this time to invest not directly in government but we would have government's blessing nor in international experts but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovation that are reaching people all across the country 
ted_00644_0699000_0707280 people like russian is often who created one of the largest microfinance bank in the country and the real role model for women inside and outside the country 
ted_00644_0707850_0716360 path named the geeky to develop the way called incremental housing and where he's moved forty thousand slum dwellers interfaith affordable communities 
ted_00644_0716360_0722290 housing educational initiatives like do and the citizen foundation that are building schools across 
ted_00644_0723570_0731190 not hyperbole to say that the civil society institutions and the social entrepreneurs are belgian real alternatives to the taliban 
ted_00644_0732420_0744970 it has been invested in pakistan for over seven years now and for those of you who worked there in a cast the pakistanis are incredibly hard working population and there's a fierce upward mobility in their very nature 
ted_00644_0746340_0754130 president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable 
ted_00644_0754720_0756260 i would say that the converse is true 
ted_00644_0757190_0768490 that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the seventy percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day provide real pathways to hope 
ted_00644_0768970_0782650 as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan while we need to strengthen the judiciary build greater stability we also need to think about lifting both leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world 
ted_00644_0783880_0791180 one of my life that is to pakistan i asked doctor sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the car desert 
ted_00644_0791540_0793700 we left karachi one morning before dawn 
ted_00644_0793700_0795480 it was about one hundred and fifteen degrees 
ted_00644_0795850_0805900 we drove for eight hours along the moon date like landscape with color lots of heat very little discussion because we were exhausted 
ted_00644_0806210_0811940 and finally at the end of the journey i could see the thin little yellow line across the horizon 
ted_00644_0812200_0815270 and as we got closer at significant became apparent 
ted_00644_0815940_0820170 there and together was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall 
ted_00644_0820450_0827700 because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life 
ted_00644_0828200_0836510 his name was rogen and he had kind twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me and my father 
ted_00644_0837000_0850350 instead it with the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his twelve children and grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about fifty cents a day 
ted_00644_0850840_0852570 because he was building these problems 
ted_00644_0853600_0855920 with the money earned he could stay this year 
ted_00644_0856100_0860420 for the first time ever in three generations his children will go to school 
ted_00644_0861990_0864730 we asked him if he was sent his daughters as well as for fun 
ted_00644_0865390_0867480 he said of course i will 
ted_00644_0867620_0877770 because i don't want them discriminated against anymore when we think about solutions to poverty we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity 
ted_00644_0878240_0893920 because at the end of the day dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth and what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity 
ted_00644_0894120_0895750 because that's where dignity really start 
ted_00644_0897110_0907310 martin luther king said that love without power is anemic and sentimental and that power without love is reckless and abusive 
ted_00644_0908570_0912160 generation has seen both approaches tried and often fail 
ted_00644_0913220_0919600 but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power 
ted_00644_0920270_0935140 for that is what will need as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really cake to build a global economy that includes all of us and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet 
ted_00644_0936150_0942420 the kind graft to begin innovating and looking for new solutions across sector is now 
ted_00644_0943180_0951360 i can only talk for my own experience but in eight years of running acumen fund i've seen the power of patient capital 
ted_00644_0951630_0965550 not only to inspire innovation and risk taking but to truly build systems that have created more than twenty five thousand jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on 
ted_00644_0965550_0966910 planet i know 
ted_00644_0967780_0970620 but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work 
ted_00644_0970930_0987030 and so i urge you in whatever sector you work and whatever job you do to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those were trying to help rather than what we think that they might need 
ted_00644_0988300_0991010 it will take embracing the world with both arms 
ted_00644_0991430_0999710 it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability with a sense of integrity and perseverance 
ted_00644_1000040_1005730 these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generation 
ted_00644_1006240_1008300 there are so much good that we can do 
ted_00644_1008970_1011550 just think of other sunflowers in the desert 
ted_00644_1012110_1016670 banking 
ted_00838_0013400_0019940 one of the things that define a tedster is you've taken your passion and you've turned into stewardship 
ted_00838_0020440_0022910 we actually put action to the issues you care about 
ted_00838_0023560_0029650 but what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out 
ted_00838_0029910_0030940 so how do you do that 
ted_00838_0031430_0037440 one of the things i should probably tell you is i worked for the discovery channel early in my career and that sort of warped my framework 
ted_00838_0037750_0043840 so when you start to think about politicians you've got to realize these are strange creatures 
ted_00838_0044580_0056680 other than the fact that they can't tell directions and have very strange breeding habits how do you actually work with these things what we need to understand is what drives the political creature 
ted_00838_0056680_0062150 and there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart one his reputation and influence 
ted_00838_0062330_0065900 so these are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job 
ted_00838_0066220_0071970 the second one unlike most animals which is survival of the species this is preservation of self 
ted_00838_0072920_0079050 you may think it's money but that's actually sort of a proxy to what i can do to preserve myself 
ted_00838_0079510_0085130 the challenge with you moving your issue forward as these animals are getting broadcast to all the time 
ted_00838_0085890_0089580 so what doesn't work in terms of getting your issue to be important 
ted_00838_0090380_0096740 you can send them an email well unfortunately i've got so many viagra ads coming at me your email is lost 
ted_00838_0096860_0098430 it doesn't matter it's spam 
ted_00838_0099940_0106590 you get on the phone while chances are gonna droid who is picking up the phone and yes they called and they said they didn't like it that doesn't move 
ted_00838_0107340_0110420 face to face would work but it's hard to set it up 
ted_00838_0110580_0113370 and it's hard to get the context and actually get communication to work 
ted_00838_0114100_0121120 yes contributions actually do make a difference and they said a context for having a conversation but to take some time to build up 
ted_00838_0121860_0124660 so what actually works and the answer is rather strange 
ted_00838_0124680_0125350 a letter 
ted_00838_0127070_0138300 we live in a digital world but we're fairly analog creatures letters actually work even the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked up by staff 
ted_00838_0139280_0145280 i can tell you that every official that i've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean 
ted_00838_0145960_0147500 so how are you going to write your letter 
ted_00838_0147850_0151160 first of all you're going to pick up an analog device a pen 
ted_00838_0152950_0159390 i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it but this is actually critical 
ted_00838_0159390_0168290 and it is critical that you actually hand write your letter it is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me 
ted_00838_0168760_0174800 second of all i'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month 
ted_00838_0175050_0183860 my promise to you if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and says what do you think 
ted_00838_0184700_0187670 going to give you a four paragraph format to work with 
ted_00838_0188680_0200510 now when you approach these animals you need to understand there is a dangerous and to them and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness 
ted_00838_0200550_0205650 so in paragraph number one what i'm going to tell you to do is very simply this t appreciate 
ted_00838_0206890_0211240 you may not appreciate the person you may not appreciate anything else for maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough game 
ted_00838_0211770_0213660 when animals are going to make a point they make the point 
ted_00838_0213670_0215650 they don't spend a lot of time around 
ted_00838_0215650_0223630 so here you go paragraph number two you may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind 
ted_00838_0224780_0229020 when you do this don't attack people you attack tactics 
ted_00838_0229470_0231040 hominem attacks will get you nowhere 
ted_00838_0231740_0239610 paragraph number three when animals are attacked or cornered they will fight to the death so you have to give them an exit 
ted_00838_0239880_0245190 for most of the time that they have an exit strategy they should take it obviously your intelligence 
ted_00838_0245220_0251770 if you had the right information you would have done the right thing lastly you want to be the nurturing agent 
ted_00838_0251780_0261410 your the safe place to come into someone paragraph number for a you're gonna tell people if no one is providing information let me help 
ted_00838_0263070_0273150 animals do displays they do two things they warn you or they try to attract you and say we need to mate you're going to do that by the way you sign your letter 
ted_00838_0273330_0277190 do a number of things you're a vice president you volunteer you do something else 
ted_00838_0277370_0278590 why is this important 
ted_00838_0278600_0288580 because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere and that my preservation depends on you 
ted_00838_0289550_0293180 is one very quick hack especially for the feds in the audience 
ted_00838_0293270_0294810 and here's how your mail your letter 
ted_00838_0295200_0301110 first of all you send the original to the district office to send a copy to the main office 
ted_00838_0301390_0312890 if we follow protocol to pick up the phone and say hey do you had the original then some droid the back puts name on a particular and says oh this is an important letter and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read 
ted_00838_0314690_0334380 so what your letter means i've got to tell you we are all in a party and political officials are the we are harangued lectured to sold marketed but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication 
ted_00838_0334660_0338630 i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carried to every council meeting i go to 
ted_00838_0339880_0349010 this is an opportunity at real dialogue and if you have stewardship and want to communicate that dialogue is incredibly powerful 
ted_00838_0349590_0354240 so when you do that here's what i can promise you're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest 
ted_00838_0354790_0355350 kept writing 
ted_00838_0359265_0359465 
ted_00981_0013700_0032010 presentation needs this slide in it it's beautiful isn't it you see all the points alder all the lines it's incredible it is the network and in my case the network has been important in media because i get to connect to people 
ted_00981_0037380_0041530 when the way that i've been doing it in multi faceted 
ted_00981_0041530_0058830 for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners i put together projects like earth sandwich where i asked people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth 
ted_00981_0059300_0069550 and people started laying bread in tribute and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain it's pretty incredible the videos online 
ted_00981_0070020_0074320 connecting to people in projects like young minami for example 
ted_00981_0074970_0123720 young minami your audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult this is the same person top photo james bottom photo julia point this was a mother's day gift particularly creepy my favorite of these photos which i couldn't find is there is a picture of a thirty year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is two hundred and twenty lb man with a tiny little old lady peaking over his shoulder 
ted_00981_0125650_0129210 but this project change the way that i thought about connecting to people 
ted_00981_0129210_0131090 this is a project called ray 
ted_00981_0131260_0136720 what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audience 
ted_00981_0136720_0140450 somebody said you have to have to listen to this and this is what came to me 
ted_00981_0141140_0151030 hi my name is re yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt were quite unfair 
ted_00981_0152200_0158790 being quite disturbed she called for comfort and i didn't really know what to tell her because we have to deal with so much mess in our society 
ted_00981_0159820_0168210 so i was led to write this song just for her to just give her some encouragement or are dealing with stress and pressure on her job 
ted_00981_0168210_0175080 i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees are under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through your job 
ted_00981_0175100_0176340 have a song goes 
ted_00981_0177630_0182330 i 'm about to whip somebody's is 
ted_00981_0184250_0190300 so i'm about to whip somebody's the 
ted_00981_0191100_0193980 if you don't leave me alone 
ted_00981_0195220_0198160 we 're going to have to send me home 
ted_00981_0198510_0202540 cause i'm about to whip somebody's 
ted_00981_0202540_0209190 now you may not be able to sing that allow that you can have it to yourself and you know the words are 
ted_00981_0209230_0214850 it gives you some strength to get through the next few moments are on your job or stay strong peace 
ted_00981_0214870_0217250 so yeah 
ted_00981_0217640_0218520 rush 
ted_00981_0218580_0219370 we can heal quickly 
ted_00981_0221020_0225220 so i was so moved by this right this is incredible this was this was connecting right 
ted_00981_0225220_0237070 was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something to wanting to to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact this was incredible this is what i wanted to do 
ted_00981_0237110_0239480 so the first thing i thought i was we have to thank him 
ted_00981_0239480_0244880 and i asked my audience i said listen to this piece of audio we have to remix and he's got a great voice 
ted_00981_0244880_0252090 but actually in the keys b flat and we have to do something with hundreds of remixes came back lots of different attempts 
ted_00981_0252100_0253600 one stood out in particular 
ted_00981_0253840_0256390 it was done by a guy named goose 
ted_00981_0258360_0258840 
ted_00981_0258850_0259710 
ted_00981_0259880_0261000 lives 
ted_00981_0261050_0304090 the i'm about to with the costs of doing the right so it was incredible that song 
ted_00981_0304360_0309500 so that song somebody told me that it was a baseball game in kansas city 
ted_00981_0309530_0316130 in the end it was it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services 
ted_00981_0316450_0321580 so i said let's put this together and an album the audience came together and they designed an album cover 
ted_00981_0321580_0333810 and i said if you put it all on this i'm going to deliver it to him if you can figure out who this person is because all i had was his name ray and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset 
ted_00981_0335440_0337470 two weeks they found him 
ted_00981_0337620_0346210 i received an email and said hi i'm re i heard you were looking for me and i was like yeah 
ted_00981_0346800_0360900 it has been an interesting two weeks so i flew to st louis and met ray and he's a preacher among other things 
ted_00981_0361160_0368110 but anyways here here's the thing because it reminds me of this which is a sign that you see in amsterdam on every street corner 
ted_00981_0368310_0371300 it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world 
ted_00981_0371310_0383260 i look at this photo and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button but it doesn't seem like he's really that interested in crossing the street and it makes me think of this 
ted_00981_0383450_0392080 on street corners everywhere people are looking at their cell phones and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture 
ted_00981_0392630_0395660 but the truth is his life is being lived there 
ted_00981_0396750_0406100 when they smile you've seen people stop all of a sudden life has been lived there somewhere up in that weird dense network 
ted_00981_0407600_0409870 this is it right to feel and be felt 
ted_00981_0409870_0414720 the most fundamental fundamental force that we're all after 
ted_00981_0414720_0422300 we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier but ultimately what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person 
ted_00981_0422840_0425500 and that's not always going to happen in physical space 
ted_00981_0425500_0429740 it's also going to happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out 
ted_00981_0430150_0436720 think of the people that build all this technology of the network a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people 
ted_00981_0437400_0441730 this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade 
ted_00981_0443415_0443615 
ted_00981_0443710_0452960 so here's a series of projects over the last few years where i've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection 
ted_00981_0454000_0455760 sometimes they're very very simple things 
ted_00981_0455760_0468590 with childhood walk with a project where i asked people to remember a walk that they used to take the child over and over again that that was sort of meaningless like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor's house and take it inside of google 
ted_00981_0469740_0478450 i promise you if you take that walk inside of google street view you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face 
ted_00981_0479190_0507870 i collected those moments the photos inside google streetview and the memories specifically our conversation started with me saying i'm bored and her replying when i'm bored i eat pretzels i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola they use some of the morbidly artistic footage a close up of chad's shoes in the middle of the highway i guess the shoes came off when he was hit 
ted_00981_0508790_0519540 but my house once and he left his pillow it had chad written in magic marker on it he died long after he left the pillow at my house so we never get around to returning it sometimes they're a little bit more abstract 
ted_00981_0519540_0520460 this is pain pack 
ted_00981_0520460_0528450 bright after september eleventh last year i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excises it from our bodies 
ted_00981_0528470_0535580 so what i did as i opened up a hotline hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event 
ted_00981_0535840_0539190 people called in and left messages like this 
ted_00981_0540090_0541170 he said 
ted_00981_0544790_0548790 i am 
ted_00981_0549020_0550250 really fortunate 
ted_00981_0551440_0555800 i fell in love 
ted_00981_0556740_0566710 even the smallest coming 
ted_00981_0567740_0575490 people think how an accident 
ted_00981_0578200_0589540 so what i did was i took those voicemails and with their permission converted them to mp three's and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those 
ted_00981_0591090_0607150 those were then distributed to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material we don't have time to play much as you can look at it online 
ted_00981_0608520_0623880 for two to forty eight with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where mccain and obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation and i was like what the hell is that look like so i thought well let's just give it a try 
ted_00981_0623890_0636020 pilots have people hold up signs about reconciliation and so some really nice things came together i voted blue i voted read together for our future i voted this very very cute little things right 
ted_00981_0636120_0658260 some came from the winning party you're forty eight i promise to listen to fight for you to respect you always some came from the party who had just lost for forty eight fifty to meet your party's leadership be as classy as you but i doubt it but the truth was is as this started becoming popular a couple of right wing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which i could also see 
ted_00981_0658430_0662380 so i started getting amazing amounts of heat male death threats even 
ted_00981_0668930_0679340 and he said i'm dressed as batman to hide my identity just in case i thought the real batman like coming after me what's actually going to give you a little better than him 
ted_00981_0679360_0689930 so what i did unfortunately it was hot harboring all this kind of like awful experience and this pain inside of me and it started to eat away at my psyche 
ted_00981_0690110_0692780 that was protecting the project from and i realized 
ted_00981_0692780_0698360 was protecting and i didn't want this special little group of photographs to get sullied in some ways 
ted_00981_0698360_0707820 so what i did i took all of those emails and i put them together into something called angrigami which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff 
ted_00981_0707970_0721500 i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami but this was this was the emotional moment 
ted_00981_0722320_0729790 one of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of heat it's amazing 
ted_00981_0730000_0743630 the last thing i'm going to tell you about his is a series of projects called songs we already know where the idea was i was trying to figure out how to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects 
ted_00981_0743690_0745340 one of them was fairly straightforward 
ted_00981_0745500_0749820 guy said that his daughter got scared at night and can i write a song for his daughter 
ted_00981_0749820_0756790 and i said oh yeah i'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep and this was scared 
ted_00981_0771820_0775540 and this is a song that as saying something 
ted_00981_0776880_0778400 it gives me good 
ted_00981_0779570_0783190 where does this mean 
ted_00981_0783800_0785820 some 
ted_00981_0787070_0788710 cities towns 
ted_00981_0788730_0789120 
ted_00981_0789120_0799580 he believes that the key chain 
ted_00981_0799580_0804420 listen 
ted_00981_0805590_0814390 ok so so i wrote that song thanking the nice thing was as he walked by his his daughter's room at some point and she was singing that song to herself 
ted_00981_0814390_0815200 so i was like awesome 
ted_00981_0815200_0815670 it was great 
ted_00981_0816200_0819110 then i got this there's a little bit of a backstory to this 
ted_00981_0820140_0828020 but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person 
ted_00981_0828300_0831270 so i asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me 
ted_00981_0831550_0834460 i got a lot like thirty and a half an hour 
ted_00981_0834460_0835600 shut that part down 
ted_00981_0835790_0842690 i chose to people to be and i asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on facebook 
ted_00981_0842730_0845980 one person sent me a very detailed description the other person didn't 
ted_00981_0846270_0850210 the person who didn't it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken a new job 
ted_00981_0850510_0854770 so people were writing me and say how's your new job as a low 
ted_00981_0856450_0862590 but anyway this the same person laura ended up emailed me a little bit after that project 
ted_00981_0862770_0865890 and i felt badly for not having done a good job 
ted_00981_0865890_0874910 and she said i'm really anxious i just moved to the town i have this new job and i just have this incredible amount of anxiety so she'd seen the scared song and wondered if i could do something 
ted_00981_0875170_0883020 so i asked her what does it feel like when you feel this way and she's wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have this anxiety 
ted_00981_0885030_0890040 i said okay i'll think about it and so quietly in the background i started sending people this 
ted_00981_0892920_0894680 
ted_00981_0896760_0898630 ok 
ted_00981_0900420_0901860 the 
ted_00981_0903370_0913110 so i asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities just so that he could sing along to the song with headphones on so i could just get their voices back 
ted_00981_0913300_0915180 this is the kind of thing that i got back 
ted_00981_0922210_0922410 
ted_00981_0922360_0923840 key 
ted_00981_0925250_0926830 the 
ted_00981_0927560_0929400 so that's one of the better ones really 
ted_00981_0930770_0936930 it often is like as i started getting more and more and more of them all of a sudden i had thirty forty voices from around the world 
ted_00981_0937220_0944070 when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden a chorus from around the world 
ted_00981_0944830_0953500 what was really great is putting all this work together in the background and laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by as he said i know you've forgotten about me 
ted_00981_0954720_0960520 just want to say thanks for even considering it and then a few days later as enter this 
ted_00981_0963390_0969240 for the day 
ted_00981_0971070_0975110 so yes 
ted_00981_0975180_0977580 shame 
ted_00981_0978420_0982500 seems like the spin 
ted_00981_0982520_0984930 standings 
ted_00981_0985830_0990420 maybe spam they can

ted_00981_1065665_1065865 
ted_01010_0013040_0021350 i grew up in a very small village in canada and i'm an undiagnosed dyslexic 
ted_01010_0022690_0024820 i had a really hard time in school 
ted_01010_0025990_0049730 in fact my mother told me eventually that i was a little kid in the village who cried all the way to school i ran away i'd left when i was twenty five years old to go to bali and there i met my incredible wife cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business 
ted_01010_0050380_0052960 it was a fairytale and then we retire 
ted_01010_0053330_0056940 when she took me to see a film that i really didn't want to see 
ted_01010_0057900_0065560 ruined my life the inconvenient truth and mister gore 
ted_01010_0066500_0075170 for kids and even if part of what he says is true they are not going to have the life that i had 
ted_01010_0076290_0088150 i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities 
ted_01010_0089160_0093250 so here's the world and here we are in bali 
ted_01010_0093890_0097910 a tiny little island sixty miles by ninety miles 
ted_01010_0098500_0101300 has an intact hindu culture 
ted_01010_0101450_0102600 cynthia and i were there 
ted_01010_0102600_0113680 we had had a wonderful life there and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give back locally 
ted_01010_0114310_0117090 and here it is it's called the green school 
ted_01010_0117400_0126240 i know it doesn't look like a school but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green 
ted_01010_0127010_0129450 the classrooms have no walls 
ted_01010_0129980_0133290 the teacher is riding on a bamboo blackboard 
ted_01010_0133580_0135610 under desks are not square 
ted_01010_0136380_0142270 but green school the children are smiling and unusual thing for school especially for me 
ted_01010_0142490_0144650 we practice holism 
ted_01010_0145220_0158340 for me it's just the idea that if this little girl graduates as a whole person chances are she'll demand a whole world a whole world to live on 
ted_01010_0159390_0165140 by children spend one hundred and eighty one days going to school in a box 
ted_01010_0166360_0172140 the people they built my school also built the prison in the insane asylum out of the same materials 
ted_01010_0174980_0181270 so if this gentleman had have had a holistic education will be sitting there 
ted_01010_0181880_0184460 what he had had more possibilities in his life 
ted_01010_0186150_0193130 classrooms have natural light they are beautiful their bamboo the breeze passes through them 
ted_01010_0193380_0200040 when the natural breeze isn't enough the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know 
ted_01010_0200040_0204160 so these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree 
ted_01010_0205500_0209120 so we basically turn the box into a bubble 
ted_01010_0209430_0218110 these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future 
ted_01010_0219840_0224290 we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill or our grandchildren 
ted_01010_0226450_0231110 we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible 
ted_01010_0233060_0239350 these kids did a little graffiti on their desks and then they signed up for two extra courses 
ted_01010_0239640_0245280 the first one was called sanding and the second one was called the re waxing 
ted_01010_0246780_0251500 but since that happened they own those desks 
ted_01010_0251830_0253930 they know they can control their world 
ted_01010_0255720_0264100 on the grand were not proud of it but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar 
ted_01010_0264780_0271920 this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on our river 
ted_01010_0272300_0277520 when the turbine drops in it will produce eight thousand watts of electricity day 
ted_01010_0277520_0279980 finite and you know what these 
ted_01010_0280830_0282110 there is nowhere to flush 
ted_01010_0282290_0288770 as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you are all really smart just do the math 
ted_01010_0289130_0291080 how many people times how much water 
ted_01010_0291990_0293010 there isn't enough water 
ted_01010_0293010_0306530 so these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them especially the principal and they work people use them people are ok it's something you should think about doing 
ted_01010_0308550_0310780 not many things didn't work 
ted_01010_0311120_0316570 the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun and six months 
ted_01010_0316600_0319290 we had to replace them with recyclable plastic 
ted_01010_0320580_0325060 with teachers drag giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms 
ted_01010_0325260_0333760 so we had some good ideas we took all the automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard 
ted_01010_0335950_0343030 green school sits in south central bali and it's on twenty acres of rolling garden 
ted_01010_0343840_0349690 is an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there how we managed to get across the river 
ted_01010_0351730_0354600 i met her father the other day he looked a little crazy 
ted_01010_0354600_0369940 said welcome to green school he said i'd been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane 
ted_01010_0371100_0375370 in august i'm bringing my son's this was a great thing 
ted_01010_0375900_0383620 but more than that people are building green houses around green school so that kids can walk to school on the paths 
ted_01010_0384180_0389970 people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants to the green school 
ted_01010_0390570_0392070 becoming a community 
ted_01010_0392660_0394290 becoming a green model 
ted_01010_0395440_0396560 we have to look at everything 
ted_01010_0397760_0409750 petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these or volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks the sidewalks or gravel they fled when it rains but their green 
ted_01010_0410740_0412220 gould buffalo 
ted_01010_0414140_0416340 he 's playing to eat that fence for dinner 
ted_01010_0417060_0418830 while the fences at green school or green 
ted_01010_0419360_0425820 and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gait they hand out the handsome man out of tapioca 
ted_01010_0426340_0440480 they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen slice them thinly and made delicious chips landscaping we managed to keep the garden was there running right up to the edge of each of the classroom 
ted_01010_0440480_0441970 we drop them gently in 
ted_01010_0442870_0447880 we made space for these guys who are balis last black pigs 
ted_01010_0449280_0456650 the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field 
ted_01010_0458230_0464420 these young ladies are living in a rice culture but they know something that few people know in a rice culture 
ted_01010_0464420_0470420 how to plant organic rice they know how to look after it they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it 
ted_01010_0471170_0476770 for their part of the rice cycle and the skills will be valuable for them in their future 
ted_01010_0477690_0480450 this young man is picking organic vegetables 
ted_01010_0481090_0485730 within four hundred people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch 
ted_01010_0485730_0486690 no gas 
ted_01010_0486950_0495320 local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers now 
ted_01010_0496520_0499370 the food is incredible 
ted_01010_0500500_0504360 green school is a place of pioneers local and global 
ted_01010_0504940_0508250 it 's a kind of microcosm of globalized world 
ted_01010_0508910_0510850 the kids are from twenty five countries 
ted_01010_0510860_0517210 when i see them together i know that they're working out how to live in the future 
ted_01010_0518130_0521640 green school is going into its third year with one hundred and sixty children 
ted_01010_0522740_0529440 school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing i was bad at it arithmetic 
ted_01010_0529770_0531320 but you also learn other things 
ted_01010_0532060_0533300 we learned bamboo building 
ted_01010_0534030_0537640 you practice ancient balinese arts 
ted_01010_0538020_0544720 this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields the kids love it the mothers aren't quite convinced 
ted_01010_0544915_0545115 
ted_01010_0547600_0552240 we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and we said okay local what is local 
ted_01010_0552240_0559850 a local means that twenty percent of the population at the school has to be balinese and this was a really big committed 
ted_01010_0560620_0561570 we were right 
ted_01010_0561920_0573720 when people are coming forward from all over the world to support the balinese scholarship fund because these kids with balis next green leaders 
ted_01010_0574750_0582110 teachers are as diverse as the student body and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up 
ted_01010_0582900_0586080 a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture 
ted_01010_0586470_0588560 a woman came from africa with music 
ted_01010_0589700_0598680 together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders 
ted_01010_0600820_0604010 green school effect we don't know what it is 
ted_01010_0604600_0606380 we need someone to come and study it 
ted_01010_0606900_0618110 about what's happening are learning different kids dyslexic we rename them prolexic are doing really well in these beautiful beautiful classrooms 
ted_01010_0618710_0620400 all the kids are thriving 
ted_01010_0621440_0630910 how did we do all this on giant grass its bamboo it comes out of the ground like a train 
ted_01010_0631540_0639370 it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested the build buildings like this 
ted_01010_0639590_0646490 chess strong and dances peak and it will hold up any roof 
ted_01010_0647470_0651970 when the architects came they brought us these things and you've probably seen things like this 
ted_01010_0651970_0666800 a yellow box was called the administration complex we squashed it we rethought it but mainly we renamed it the heart of school and that changed everything forever 
ted_01010_0667310_0669540 a double helix 
ted_01010_0669550_0672570 it has administrators in it and many many other things 
ted_01010_0688310_0726630 balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age old techniques mostly by hand it was chaos and the balinese carpenters wanted to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down we realized that we had a cathedral cathedral green and a cathedral to green education 
ted_01010_0727390_0730130 the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it 
ted_01010_0731010_0735900 from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs and floors 
ted_01010_0736440_0742970 it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world but many people believe that it's the most beautiful 
ted_01010_0744200_0746980 this doable in your community 
ted_01010_0747700_0748690 we believe it is 
ted_01010_0749010_0751960 green school is a model we built for the world 
ted_01010_0752950_0754570 a model we built for bali 
ted_01010_0755080_0767210 you just have to follow these simple simple rules be local like the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build 
ted_01010_0768960_0771520 so mr gore thank you 
ted_01010_0772150_0775710 ruined my life but you gave me an incredible future 
ted_01010_0776830_0785530 if you're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next fifty around the world please come and see us 
ted_01010_0786180_0786650 thank you 
ted_01010_0786575_0786775 
ted_01283_0012790_0028220 when i graduated i moved to northern california and i lived in a little town called elk on the mendocino coast and i didn't have a phone or tv but i had u s mail and life was good back then if you could remember it 
ted_01283_0029670_0052380 go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie ship my film to san francisco and lo and behold two days later it would end up on my front door which was way better than having to fight the traffic of hollywood i didn't have much money but i had time in a sense of wonder 
ted_01283_0052700_0055450 started shooting time lapse photography 
ted_01283_0055970_0061310 it would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll film because that's all i could afford 
ted_01283_0062970_0074140 shooting time lapse flowers continuously nonstop twenty four hours a day seven days a week for over thirty years at the theater move a dance i'll never get tired 
ted_01283_0075360_0079610 beauty in murtha does with color taste touch 
ted_01283_0080170_0092020 it also provides a third of the food we eat raw and seduction is nature's tools for survival because we pretend probably fall in love with 
ted_01283_0093110_0098080 it opens our hearts and makes us realize we are part of nature and we're not separate from it 
ted_01283_0099980_0107740 when we see ourselves in nature but also connects us to every one of us because it's clear that it's all connected in one 
ted_01283_0109630_0116000 people say my images a lot of times will say oh my god have you ever wondered what that meant 
ted_01283_0117030_0121580 oh means caught your attention makes your present makes you mindful 
ted_01283_0122900_0126610 the mining connects with something deep inside your soul 
ted_01283_0128010_0131100 creates a gateway for your inner voice to rise up and be heard 
ted_01283_0132170_0132770 god 
ted_01283_0134030_0143050 that personal journey we all want to be on to be inspired to feel like we're connected to a universe that celebrates life 
ted_01283_0145180_0150380 did you know that eighty percent of the information we receive comes through our eyes 
ted_01283_0151450_0158280 if you compare light energy to musical scales it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see which is right in the middle 
ted_01283_0159870_0168780 enormously grateful for our brains that can now take the electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world 
ted_01283_0171100_0183180 we are grateful the way of hearts that can feel the vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature 
ted_01283_0185910_0208060 it is a gift to cultivate appreciation and gratitude the gift i want to share with you today a project i'm working on called happiness revealed that will give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of therefore 
ted_01283_0208060_0264990 when i watch tv show that airplane and when you get our imagination and irony hack and when you get more imagination and shawn again harangue can get more and purify fan the path of the half have any credit card and i could be theater 
ted_01283_0264990_0280540 the you think this is just another day 
ted_01283_0283710_0285460 not just another day 
ted_01283_0286390_0307790 to one day that is given to you today given to you the trickiest it's the only gift that you're right now and you only appropriate response is grateful 
ted_01283_0318070_0343110 we should do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift this unique day is here she learned to the school and as if it were the first to life and in the very last day you will spend the day 
ted_01283_0347340_0361050 begin by opening your eyes and be surprised that you have emerged who can open the incredible array of colors is constantly refer to as pure joy 
ted_01283_0363910_0365270 book a sky 
ted_01283_0367350_0369270 we show real task 
ted_01283_0370730_0378750 we should really no different from moment to moment discounts coming and going 
ted_01283_0380800_0387330 just think of the vendor even if the weather we don't think of the many nuances 
ted_01283_0388420_0391260 we just think of good weather batman 
ted_01283_0392600_0401930 the unique weather may be a kind that never exactly in that can we can 
ted_01283_0403040_0411690 formation of charles sky will never be the same open your eyes look 
ted_01283_0416070_0418850 looking at the faces of people 
ted_01283_0420830_0438450 each one has incredible story behind the story that you could fathom not only can own story but the story of the answers 
ted_01283_0438450_0473050 the backs of this present moment they are the people who need time that life for generations and so many patients the truest to meet you in the life giving water she owns it took me a while to drink 
ted_01283_0475440_0481130 open your heart to the incredible gifts that civilization 
ted_01283_0482340_0486040 skip the switch and pick my

ted_01283_0494380_0500360 pakistan millions and millions will never experience 
ted_01283_0501750_0508190 these are just a few of an enormous numbers gift to which we can hope 
ted_01283_0510650_0539690 the issue that human exploration and let them through trujillo that everyone will be done this will be blessed by you buy your mind paying touch just play your presence 
ted_01283_0542500_0556770 the gratefulness overflow into pressing on the then it will clearly being a good day 
ted_01283_0568770_0572220 thank you very much 
ted_01556_0012580_0014510 like to tell you about two games of chess 
ted_01556_0015750_0021650 it first happened in one thousand nine ninety seven which gary kasparov a human lost the deep blue a machine 
ted_01556_0022690_0026740 for many this was the dawn of a new era one were man would be dominated by machine 
ted_01556_0028380_0034460 but here we are twenty years on and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad not how 
ted_01556_0036060_0045050 the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in two thousand and five in which man and machine could enter together as partners rather than adversaries if they chose 
ted_01556_0045980_0047520 at first the results were predictable 
ted_01556_0048000_0051870 even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop 
ted_01556_0052780_0062460 surprise came at the end who won not a grandmaster with a supercomputer but actually to american amateurs using three relatively weak laptops 
ted_01556_0063820_0074960 ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries 
ted_01556_0075900_0081560 is an astonishing result average men average machines beating the best man the best machine 
ted_01556_0082780_0085120 anyway then it's supposed to be man versus machine 
ted_01556_0085880_0089030 instead it's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation 
ted_01556_0090350_0095590 we've been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky s vision for artificial intelligence over the last fifty years 
ted_01556_0096250_0100610 the sexy vision for sure many have embraced it has become the dominant school of thought and computer science 
ted_01556_0101460_0112510 but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology i'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time 
ted_01556_0113720_0119790 i'm talking about j c r licklider human computer symbiosis perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation 
ted_01556_0120720_0125250 quick glider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the internet 
ted_01556_0126090_0135740 his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs 
ted_01556_0136920_0146770 note that word cooperate licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from star trek but to take a human and make her more capable 
ted_01556_0147950_0155620 humans are so amazing how we think are non linear approaches are creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult as possible for computers to do 
ted_01556_0156130_0163210 letter intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses determining the criteria and performing the evaluation 
ted_01556_0164040_0166130 of course in other ways humans are so limited 
ted_01556_0166130_0168420 with terrible at scale computation and volume 
ted_01556_0169200_0172510 we require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing 
ted_01556_0172980_0178110 licklider foresaw computers doing all the route nyse of a work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making 
ted_01556_0179020_0183340 silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess 
ted_01556_0184020_0194610 protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease 
ted_01556_0195280_0198720 for this task supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough 
ted_01556_0199530_0203480 bullet a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach 
ted_01556_0204500_0214140 non technical non biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually arrange the structure of the protein allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues 
ted_01556_0214840_0219240 this approach beat supercomputers fifty percent of the time and tide thirty percent of the time 
ted_01556_0220470_0226600 foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure the mason pfizer monkey virus 
ted_01556_0226620_0235860 protease that had eluded determination for over ten years was solved by three players in a matter of days perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game 
ted_01556_0236790_0240400 last year on the side of the twin towers and nine eleven memorial opened 
ted_01556_0240730_0251450 it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency places the names the next to each other based on their relationships to one another friends families coworkers 
ted_01556_0251910_0261150 when you put it all together it's quite a computational challenge thirty five hundred victims eighty one hundred adjacency requests the importance of the overall physical specifications and 
ted_01556_0261150_0268250 final aesthetics when first reported by the media full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the new york city design firm 
ted_01556_0269690_0271150 but the truth is a bit more nuanced 
ted_01556_0271570_0276970 while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans use that framework to design the final result 
ted_01556_0277430_0289810 so in this case a computer evaluated millions of possible layouts managed to complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices 
ted_01556_0290550_0293490 so the more you look around you the more you see licklider vision everywhere 
ted_01556_0293970_0299240 whether it's augmented reality and your iphone or gps in your car human computer symbiosis is making us more capable 
ted_01556_0299890_0302490 so if you want to improve human computer symbiosis what can you do 
ted_01556_0302820_0305260 and you can start by designing the human into the process 
ted_01556_0305640_0310270 instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around with the human will do as well 
ted_01556_0311500_0319010 when you do this you'll quickly realized that you spend all of your time on the interface between man and machine specifically on designing away the friction and the interaction 
ted_01556_0319890_0325530 in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability 
ted_01556_0325740_0330200 so that's why to amateurs with few laptops handily be a supercomputer and a grandmaster 
ted_01556_0330580_0333340 what kasparov calls process as a byproduct of friction 
ted_01556_0333610_0335320 the better the process the less the friction 
ted_01556_0336570_0339200 minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable 
ted_01556_0340330_0342030 take another example big data 
ted_01556_0342570_0348480 every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer 
ted_01556_0348580_0353520 the result is big data and actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition 
ted_01556_0354050_0359180 a major emphasis of most approaches to begin to focus on how do i store this data how do i searched the state 
ted_01556_0359180_0363140 processes data these are necessary but insufficient questions 
ted_01556_0363190_0366400 imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute 
ted_01556_0366430_0368990 so how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale 
ted_01556_0369700_0372090 again we start by designing the human into the process 
ted_01556_0373710_0383440 when payout was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do i send money back and forth online it was how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging 
ted_01556_0383460_0400060 because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose 
ted_01556_0400990_0406880 while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest the difference between success and failure 
ted_01556_0408120_0415310 a whole class of problems like this one's with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern this discernible the computers 
ted_01556_0416150_0421400 instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried and big data 
ted_01556_0422280_0432320 for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting and minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on tv these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human 
ted_01556_0432810_0442300 computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors are humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them 
ted_01556_0443290_0445660 sama bin laden was not caught by artificial intelligence 
ted_01556_0445890_0450400 he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnership with various technologies 
ted_01556_0453150_0457080 as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data mind your way to the answer 
ted_01556_0457110_0466600 there is no fine terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems to less effective data mining can be 
ted_01556_0467320_0479180 instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface 
ted_01556_0480860_0491000 this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting it in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before 
ted_01556_0492080_0494980 for some this as terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications 
ted_01556_0495510_0502390 to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance 
ted_01556_0502390_0505630 it must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intentions 
ted_01556_0507000_0513590 so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent times 
ted_01556_0515500_0522340 in october two thousand and seven us and coalition forces raided et al qaeda safe house in the city of singe are on the syrian bordeaux of iraq 
ted_01556_0522930_0532310 they found a treasure trove of documents seven hundred biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families and the golf the levant in north africa to join al qaeda in iraq 
ted_01556_0533000_0537260 these records were human resource once the foreign fighters filled the amount as they joined the organization 
ted_01556_0537450_0546090 it turns out that al qaeda to is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek 
ted_01556_0546880_0549300 and that last question a surprising insight was revealed 
ted_01556_0549730_0561570 the vast majority of foreign fighters are seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between two thousand and three and two thousand and seven iraq had three thousand eight hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of 
ted_01556_0561570_0563760 instability analyzing this data 
ted_01556_0564050_0567440 the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated 
ted_01556_0567700_0574470 the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans pdfs and tenacity alone 
ted_01556_0575290_0582640 the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 
ted_01556_0583210_0591500 twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from libya fifty percent of those from a single town in libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at three percent 
ted_01556_0592020_0598520 it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance and al qaeda abu yahya al libi a senior cleric and the libyan islamic fighting group 
ted_01556_0599120_0604010 in march two thousand and seven he gave a speech after wish there was a surge in participation amongst libyan foreign fighters 
ted_01556_0605010_0617350 perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in syria there were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border 
ted_01556_0618140_0622570 so these networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit 
ted_01556_0623180_0628630 for example they charge saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda 
ted_01556_0629740_0632820 perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would be 
ted_01556_0634330_0643080 in january two thousand and ten a devastating seven point zero earthquake struck haiti third deadliest earthquake of all time left one million people ten percent of the population homeless 
ted_01556_0644500_0650290 once seemingly small aspect of the overall relief effort became increasingly important as the delivery of food and water set of rolling 
ted_01556_0651500_0655240 in january and february dry months in haiti many of the camps to develop standing water 
ted_01556_0656140_0661090 the only institution with detailed knowledge of haiti's floodplains had been leveled and the earthquake leadership inside 
ted_01556_0663060_0672010 so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and given very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation 
ted_01556_0672860_0674280 data was incredibly disparate 
ted_01556_0674290_0677510 u s army had detailed knowledge were only a small section of the country 
ted_01556_0677760_0682810 it was data online from a two thousand and six environmental risk conference others geospatial data none of an integrated 
ted_01556_0684000_0687680 the human goal here was to identify cancer relocation based on priority need 
ted_01556_0688470_0696030 the computer had to integrate a vast amount of geospatial information social media data and relief organization information to answer this question 
ted_01556_0696840_0704430 by implementing a superior process what was otherwise a task for forty people over three months became a simple job for three people in forty hours 
ted_01556_0705160_0707260 victories for human computer symbiosis 
ted_01556_0707270_0717360 where more than fifty years into licklider his vision for the future and the data suggests that we should be quite excited about tackling this century's hardest problems man and machine and cooperation together 
ted_01556_0717750_0718080 thank you 
ted_01911_0012730_0023390 i spent the last two years trying to resolve to ending why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies were aware 
ted_01911_0023400_0026220 for i have worked with more than five hundred companies 
ted_01911_0027320_0034220 but despite all the technological advances computers i t communications telecommunications the internet 
ted_01911_0035550_0040050 he managed to why is there so little engagement at work 
ted_01911_0040050_0050830 why do people feel so miserable even actively engaged disengaging their colleagues acting against the interests of their company 
ted_01911_0051930_0065360 but despite all the affiliation events the celebration the people in she achieves the leadership development programs to train managers on how to beat yamauchi they their teams 
ted_01911_0067590_0073300 but at the beginning i thought there was a chicken and egg issue because people are less engaged they are less productive 
ted_01911_0073370_0077480 or vice versa because they are less productive we put more pressure and they are less engaged 
ted_01911_0077690_0086730 but as we are doing our analysis we realized that there was a common with close to these two issues that relate in fact to the basic pillars of management 
ted_01911_0087330_0090020 the way we organize is based on two 
ted_01911_0090520_0099900 hard structure process systems the soft shillings sentiments interpersonal relationships traits personnel 
ted_01911_0100120_0109420 whenever we company reorganize restructure reengineer go through a cultural transformation program it uses these two pillars 
ted_01911_0109640_0113480 and now we try to refine them we try to combine them 
ted_01911_0113640_0120490 real issue is and this is the answer to the two enigmatic these pillars are obsolete 
ted_01911_0120690_0133630 you read in business books is based a though one of your they're all their combination they are obsolete what does it work how do they work when you try to use these were portuguese in front of the complexity of business 
ted_01911_0133970_0144200 how to approach basically that you start from strategy requirements structure process system keeps the ice cookout committees headquarters hubs clusters you name it 
ted_01911_0144570_0149350 i forgot all the matrix incentive communities middle officials and interfaces 
ted_01911_0149910_0154860 what happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business 
ted_01911_0155270_0159530 we need quality cursed reliability speed 
ted_01911_0160410_0163380 there is a new requirement we use the same approach 
ted_01911_0163460_0169160 we create dedicated picture process systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business 
ted_01911_0169640_0174560 hub approach create just complicated ness in the organization 
ted_01911_0175090_0181430 so let's take an example an automotive company the engineering division is a five dimensional matrix 
ted_01911_0181480_0186680 if you open any cell of the matrix to fight another twenty three dimensional matrix 
ted_01911_0186720_0191180 we have mr noise mischief petrol consumption mr archie cochrane properties 
ted_01911_0191180_0199050 for any new requirement you have a dedicated function in charge of lining engineers against the new requirement 
ted_01911_0199360_0201760 what happens when the new requirement 
ted_01911_0201900_0207960 some years ago the new requirement appeared on the marketplace the length of the women she period 
ted_01911_0208160_0212630 so they are for the new requirement is repair ability making gas easy to repair 
ted_01911_0212670_0225340 otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the like if you had to remove the engine to access delights the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours and were raunchy budget will explode 
ted_01911_0225540_0227900 so what was the solution using the how to approach 
ted_01911_0228450_0234840 she 's a new requirement the solution is to create a new function mystery probability 
ted_01911_0235760_0238980 mystery perishability critical capability process 
ted_01911_0239710_0246090 with the reaper habitually scorecard with ripa ability matrix and eventually you capability infantile 
ted_01911_0246370_0249340 came on top of twenty five or they occupy 
ted_01911_0250060_0253250 what percentage of these people is variable compensation 
ted_01911_0253850_0260830 when she presented most divided by twenty six keep your eyes probability makes a difference of zero point eight percent 
ted_01911_0261520_0268210 what the candidates making their actions their choices to simplify zero but where to curse for zero impact 
ted_01911_0268210_0275790 a mystery but i d g process cookout evaluation coordination with a twenty five other coordinators to have zero impact 
ted_01911_0276480_0283320 now in front of the new complexity of business the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines 
ted_01911_0284570_0286470 it 's basically the interplay 
ted_01911_0287560_0289210 how the paths work together 
ted_01911_0290040_0294400 connections the interactions the snap 
ted_01911_0294990_0315800 it 's not the skeleton of books sees it is the nervous system of adaptive ness and intelligence you know you could call it cooperation basically whenever people cooperate they use less resources in everything you do capability issue is a corporation problem 
ted_01911_0316940_0324900 when you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the aft yourselves garages 
ted_01911_0325990_0332340 when we don't cooperate we need more time more equipment ma systems more teams 
ted_01911_0332530_0340150 we need when procurement supply chain manufacturing don't cooperate with mustard more inventories more working capital 
ted_01911_0340300_0345460 who will pay for that shareholders customers know that we refuse 
ted_01911_0345470_0346370 so who is left 
ted_01911_0347070_0357380 the employee who has to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation stress burnout they are overwhelmed accident 
ted_01911_0358120_0359650 no wonder they disengage 
ted_01911_0360970_0364310 how do the hard and soft try to foster cooperation 
ted_01911_0366840_0374250 hub in banks when there is a problem with tobacco she's on the front office they don't cooperate what's the solution 
ted_01911_0374430_0376050 they create a middle office 
ted_01911_0378080_0379520 what happens when your later 
ted_01911_0379570_0382880 instead of one problem between the back into the front now have two problems 
ted_01911_0382930_0385750 between the back end between the middle and the front 
ted_01911_0386190_0388060 plus i have to pay for the middle office 
ted_01911_0388670_0392040 how the approach is unable to foster cooperation 
ted_01911_0392070_0395600 it can only add new book sees new bones in the skeleton 
ted_01911_0396450_0401360 soft approach to make people cooperate we need to make them like each other 
ted_01911_0401960_0406400 improving their personal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate 
ted_01911_0406460_0420280 which is totally wrong if you live and counter productive look at home i have to tvs why precisely not to have to cooperate with my way not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife 
ted_01911_0420490_0426740 why i don't worry i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife precisely because i love my wife 
ted_01911_0427240_0445100 if i didn't love my wife one gb will be enough you will watch my favorite football game you feel happy carries the book all the door the more we like each other the more we avoid the real cooperation that would train our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs 
ted_01911_0445290_0450520 we go for a second tv or will escalate the decision above for arbitration 
ted_01911_0451130_0454430 definitely these approaches are obsolete 
ted_01911_0456010_0464300 to deal with complexity to enhance the nervous system we have created what we call the smashed simplicity approach based on simple rules 
ted_01911_0464500_0468520 simple rule number one understand what others do 
ted_01911_0469940_0471290 what is the real work 
ted_01911_0471700_0482630 we need to go beyond the book sees the job descriptions beyond the face of the container to understand the real content 
ted_01911_0483070_0489450 me designer is happy to why you're here i know that it will mean that you will have to remove the engine to access the lights 
ted_01911_0490010_0492920 second you need to reinforce integrator 
ted_01911_0492970_0502640 integrators are not middle or she sees the managers existing managers that reinforces the half power an interest to make all their cooperate 
ted_01911_0503260_0517810 how can you reinforce your managers as integrators by removing layers when they are too many layers people are too far from the extra and therefore they keep your eyes matrix they need poor proxies for reality 
ted_01911_0517840_0522370 we don't understand reality and they add the complicated ness of matrix kph 
ted_01911_0522600_0532730 by removing roofs the bigger we are the more we did integrators therefore less rules we must have to give discretionary power to manage 
ted_01911_0532910_0536050 we do the opposite the bigger and we are the more rules we create 
ted_01911_0536080_0539000 we end up with the encyclopaedia britannica roofs 
ted_01911_0539480_0546080 we need to increase the quantity of power so that you can empower everybody to use the judgment their intelligence 
ted_01911_0546310_0555300 we must get more cows to people that they have the critical mass of cows to take the risk to cooperate to move out of installation 
ted_01911_0555330_0561820 otherwise they will withdraw they will disengage these words they come from game theory and organizational sociology 
ted_01911_0562220_0564510 can increase the shadow of the future 
ted_01911_0565100_0570450 create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions 
ted_01911_0570650_0575030 which is where the automotive company did when they so that mystery behind the jihad no impact 
ted_01911_0575370_0597700 they say to the design engineers now in three years when the new car is launched on the market you will move to the actual since network and become in charge of the raunchy budget and neither around the raunchy budget explode it will explode in your head much more powerful than zero point eight percent variable compensation 
ted_01911_0599110_0605690 we need also to increase reciprocity by removing the buffers that make us self sufficient 
ted_01911_0606420_0614780 when you remove these bushels you hold me by the nose i hold you by the year we will cooperate remove the second cd 
ted_01911_0614820_0622600 there are many seconds she does that work they don't create value that just provide dysfunctional self sufficiency 
ted_01911_0623090_0627160 you need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate 
ted_01911_0627180_0632820 ceo of the lego group you're gonna stop has a great way to use it 
ted_01911_0632930_0652000 he says blame is not for failure it is for failing to help or ask for help you changes everything so then it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses my real forecast because i knew i will not let me if i fail but if i fail to help or ask for help 
ted_01911_0653240_0657720 when you do this it has a lot of implications on organizational design 
ted_01911_0659170_0662840 we stopped doing boxes dotted line through line you can do incomplete 
ted_01911_0663080_0666910 it has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use 
ted_01911_0667200_0669690 human resource management practices 
ted_01911_0669920_0675300 when you do that you can manage complexity the new complexity of business without getting 
ted_01911_0676770_0680250 create more value with lower cost 
ted_01911_0680530_0693290 simultaneously improved performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common would cause that hinders both complicated ness this is your battle business leaders 
ted_01911_0694240_0696730 real battle is not against competitors 
ted_01911_0696970_0699130 is rubbish very abstract 
ted_01911_0699290_0701300 when we meet competitors to fight them 
ted_01911_0702040_0707640 the real battle against ourselves against our bureaucracy our complicated 
ted_01911_0708350_0710600 if only you can fight can do 
ted_01911_0711500_0711890 thank you 
ted_02032_0013050_0023170 we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information 
ted_02032_0024080_0026610 scientists tell us that the world is warming 
ted_02032_0027010_0029160 scientists tell us that vaccines are safe 
ted_02032_0029490_0031130 but how do we know if they're right 
ted_02032_0031450_0033200 why should we believe the science 
ted_02032_0033580_0036880 the fact is many of us actually don't believe the science 
ted_02032_0036980_0051920 public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportion to the american people don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities don't think that there's evolution by natural selection and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines 
ted_02032_0052770_0055510 so why should we believe the science 
ted_02032_0056300_0059720 scientists don't like talking about science as a matter of belief 
ted_02032_0060000_0064790 in fact they would contract science with faith and they would say belief in the domain of faith 
ted_02032_0065410_0068790 fade as a separate thing apart and distinct from science 
ted_02032_0069190_0075040 indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal's wager 
ted_02032_0076250_0092300 blaise pascal with the seventeenth century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in god and his wager went like this well if god doesn't exist but i decided to believe in him nothing much is really lost 
ted_02032_0092500_0100010 maybe a few hours on sunday but god exists and i don't believe in him then i'm in deep trouble 
ted_02032_0100460_0103380 so pascal said we'd better believe in god 
ted_02032_0103540_0112380 whereas one of my college professor said he clutched but the handrail faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind 
ted_02032_0114350_0119750 and now the fact is though for most of us most scientific claims are leap of faith 
ted_02032_0120230_0124350 we can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases 
ted_02032_0124850_0129440 indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties 
ted_02032_0129840_0133870 so if you think about it and geologists can't tell you whether the vaccine is safe 
ted_02032_0134240_0136880 both chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory 
ted_02032_0137220_0143110 physicists cannot tell you despite the claims of some of them whether or not tobacco causes cancer 
ted_02032_0144280_0153740 so if he didn't scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own field then why do they accept the claims of other scientists 
ted_02032_0153800_0155790 why did they believe each other's claims 
ted_02032_0156140_0158320 should we believe those claims 
ted_02032_0159430_0164430 so what i'd like to argue that yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think 
ted_02032_0165000_0170340 most of us were taught in school the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method 
ted_02032_0170800_0177720 we were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims 
ted_02032_0178180_0185450 the method that most of us were taught in school we can call it the textbook method is the hypothetical inductive method 
ted_02032_0185940_0206890 according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses they deduced the consequences alone hypotheses and then they go out into the world and they say okay well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say great we know the hypothesis is correct 
ted_02032_0207400_0212370 so there are many famous examples in the history of science as scientists doing exactly this 
ted_02032_0212420_0216120 one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein 
ted_02032_0216570_0225860 when einstein developed the theory of general relativity one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric 
ted_02032_0226240_0230320 that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun 
ted_02032_0230840_0237240 so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it 
ted_02032_0237730_0247770 that was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to tested but they did tested in one thousand nine hundred and keen and lo and behold it turn out to be true 
ted_02032_0248430_0250890 it actually does band as it travels around the sun 
ted_02032_0251330_0253550 was a huge confirmation of the theory 
ted_02032_0253700_0259720 which consume proof of the truth of this radical new idea and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe 
ted_02032_0261270_0269240 sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the inductive normal logical model mainly because of academics like to make things complicated 
ted_02032_0270340_0275500 but also because in the ideal case it's about laws 
ted_02032_0275560_0278250 so no more logical means having to do with laws 
ted_02032_0278440_0283490 in the case the hypothesis isn't just an idea ideally it's a law of nature 
ted_02032_0283980_0285850 why does it matter that it's the law of nature 
ted_02032_0286300_0288590 because if it's a lot it can't be broken 
ted_02032_0288860_0294330 with the law then it will always be true in all times in all places no matter what the circumstances are 
ted_02032_0294680_0305450 all of you know at least one example of a famous law einstein's famous equation e equal mc squared which tells us what the relationship is between energy and matter 
ted_02032_0305670_0308430 that relationship is true no matter what 
ted_02032_0309360_0312890 and now it turns out that there are several pounds with this model 
ted_02032_0313230_0322790 the main problem is wrong joe and i'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong 
ted_02032_0323210_0325420 for the first reason is a logical reason 
ted_02032_0325790_0328840 the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequence 
ted_02032_0329140_0334520 so that's another fancy academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions 
ted_02032_0334780_0339530 so just because the predictions come true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct 
ted_02032_0339990_0343530 i have a good example of that to again from the history of science 
ted_02032_0343930_0350450 is a picture of the ptolemaic universe when the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it 
ted_02032_0351130_0361150 the ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries will fly with the answer is because it made lots of predictions came true 
ted_02032_0361450_0372610 the ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet in fact more accurate predictions at first then the copernican theory which we now with thing is true 
ted_02032_0373210_0375850 so that's one problem with the textbook model 
ted_02032_0376020_0380350 second problem is a practical problem and it's the problem of auxiliary hyde park 
ted_02032_0381580_0389000 auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that there are making 
ted_02032_0389590_0396510 so an important example of this comes from the copernican model which ultimately replace the ptolemaic system 
ted_02032_0397120_0412410 so when i copernicus said actually the earth is not the center of the universe the fun is the center of the solar system the earth moves around the sun scientists said well ok nikolai if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the earth around the sun 
ted_02032_0412720_0416200 so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallel 
ted_02032_0416940_0435030 astronomers said if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent starlets a serious line on manhattan's you can see the stars but imagine around the country imagine you chose that raw life and we look at a star in december we see that star against a backdrop of distant stars 
ted_02032_0435610_0445660 we now make the same observation six months later when the moon when the earth has moved to this position in june we looked at that same style we see it against the different backdrop 
ted_02032_0446190_0449740 that difference that angular difference is the stellar parents 
ted_02032_0450010_0452940 so this is a prediction that the copernican model maker 
ted_02032_0453190_0460060 astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing nothing at all 
ted_02032_0460920_0464280 many people argue that this proved that the copernican mouse false 
ted_02032_0464740_0473720 so what happened well in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making chuan jewelry hypotheses both of which we were now say were incorrect 
ted_02032_0474000_0476900 the first was an assumption about the size of the earth's orbit 
ted_02032_0477750_0482770 astronomers were assuming that the earth's orbit was large relative to the distance the stars 
ted_02032_0483270_0489520 today we withdraw the picture more like this if comes from nasa and you see the earth's orbit is actually quite small 
ted_02032_0489520_0491960 in fact it's actually much smaller and even then shown here 
ted_02032_0492460_0496890 stellar parallax therefore is very small and actually very hard to detect 
ted_02032_0497590_0507740 that leads to the second reason why the predictions and work because scientists were also assuming that the telescope's they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallel 
ted_02032_0508210_0509880 and that turned out not to be true 
ted_02032_0510270_0515580 it wasn't until the one thousand nine hundred and century that scientists were able to detect the seller parallax 
ted_02032_0516010_0518160 so there's a third problem as well 
ted_02032_0518750_0523570 the third problem is simply a factual palm that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model 
ted_02032_0524140_0527990 a lot of science isn't inductive at all it actually inductive 
ted_02032_0528240_0536710 by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily started with theories and hypotheses often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world 
ted_02032_0537390_0542070 the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived charles darwin 
ted_02032_0542720_0549350 when darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the beagle he didn't have a hypothesis he didn't have a theory 
ted_02032_0549660_0554640 he just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data 
ted_02032_0554730_0561110 when he knew that he hated medicine because the silent blood made them sick so he had to have an alternative career path 
ted_02032_0561520_0563360 he started collecting data 
ted_02032_0563740_0566760 he collected many things including his famous finches 
ted_02032_0566810_0570870 when he collected these finches he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant 
ted_02032_0571450_0580930 for many years later back in london darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation and that explanation was the theory of natural selection 
ted_02032_0581700_0586100 besides inductive science scientists also often participate in modeling 
ted_02032_0586580_0596460 one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things and how did we do that well one way you can do is to build a model that tests and idea 
ted_02032_0596870_0623720 so this is a picture of henry canal who is a scottish geologists in the nineteenth century you can county scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and wellington boots and control wanted to answer the question how mountains formed and one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the appalachians you often find that the rocks in them are folded and unfolded in a particular way which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side 
ted_02032_0624090_0628010 this idea with later play a major role in discussions of continental drift 
ted_02032_0628040_0634720 so he built this model this crazy contraption would leavers and wood and here's a wheelbarrow buckets of being sledgehammer 
ted_02032_0635010_0652690 i don't know why he's got the wellington boots maybe it's going to rain and he created the physical model in order to demonstrate that you couldn't create you could in fact create patterns and rocks or at least in this case in mud that looked a lot like mountains if you compress them from five 
ted_02032_0652900_0655820 so it was an argument about the cause of mountains 
ted_02032_0656480_0664250 nowadays most scientists prefer to work inside so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations 
ted_02032_0664340_0666850 computer simulations that kind of a model 
ted_02032_0667090_0674730 a model that made with mathematics and light the physical models of the nineteenth century it's very important for thinking about causes 
ted_02032_0675960_0682110 so one of the big questions do with climate change we have tremendous amount of evidence that the earth is warming warming up 
ted_02032_0682440_0700450 this slide here the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last one hundred and fifty years showing that the earth's temperature has steadily increased and you can see in particular that in the last fifty years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade or almost two degrees fahrenheit 
ted_02032_0701100_0703690 so what though is driving that change 
ted_02032_0703700_0707260 how can we know what's causing the observed warming 
ted_02032_0707720_0710950 scientists can model it using a computer simulation 
ted_02032_0711540_0729270 so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth's climate so sulphate particles from air pollution volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions changes in solar radiation and of course greenhouse gases 
ted_02032_0729590_0737780 they asked the question what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life 
ted_02032_0738080_0740060 so here's the real life and black 
ted_02032_0740360_0749470 here's the model in this light gray and the answer is a model that includes it's the answer he on that fhp all of the above 
ted_02032_0750530_0765890 the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurement is with all of these things put together including greenhouse gases and in particular you can see that the increasing greenhouse gases tax this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last fifty years 
ted_02032_0766130_0775330 so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason fly 
ted_02032_0777070_0796300 so now because there are all these different things and scientists do the philosopher paul feyerabend famously said the only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is anything goes now this quotation has often been taken out of context because fire up and was not actually saying that in science anything goes 
ted_02032_0796640_0812400 what he was saying was actually the full quotation is if you pressed me to say what is the method of science i would have to say anything goes what he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things scientists are creative 
ted_02032_0813490_0828840 but then this pushes the question back if scientists don't use a single method and how do they decide what's right and what's wrong and who judges and the answer is scientists judge and they judged by judging evidence 
ted_02032_0829210_0836480 scientists collect evidence in many different ways but however they collected they have to subjected to scrutiny 
ted_02032_0837060_0856960 this led the sociologist robert merton to focus on the question of how scientists scrutinized data and evidence and he said they do it in a way he called organized skepticism and by that he meant to organize because they do it collectively they do it as a group and skepticism because they do it from a position of distrust 
ted_02032_0857270_0861120 sorry to say the burden of proof is on the person with the novel claim 
ted_02032_0861720_0864650 in this and science is intrinsically conservative 
ted_02032_0864910_0881940 it's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say yes we know something this is true so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts what we find that actually really major changes in scientific thinking on relatively rare in the history of science 
ted_02032_0883070_0912850 so finally that brings us to one more idea if scientists judge evidence collectively this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus and to say that at the end of the day what science is what scientific knowledge is is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny collective scrutiny have judged the evidence and concluded come to a conclusion about it either yea or nay 
ted_02032_0914230_0917680 so we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts 
ted_02032_0917950_0923550 we can also think of scientists being a kind of a jury except it's a very special kind of jury 
ted_02032_0923910_0927160 not a jury of your peers it's a jury of geeks 
ted_02032_0928120_0941020 a jury of men and women with ph d and unlike a conventional jury which had only two choices guilty not guilty the scientific actually has a number of choices 
ted_02032_0941400_0943440 scientists can say yes something true 
ted_02032_0944250_0946550 scientists can say no it's false 
ted_02032_0947080_0951780 they can say well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evident 
ted_02032_0952420_0958610 they can say it might be true but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later 
ted_02032_0959950_0962060 what scientists call intractable 
ted_02032_0963940_0971670 this leads us to one final problem if scientists would scientists say it is and isn't digestion appeal to authority 
ted_02032_0972090_0975720 weren't we all taught in school of the appeal to authority and a logical fallacy 
ted_02032_0976430_0996980 well the paradox of modern science the paradox of the conclusion i think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to that actually scientists is the appeal to authority back if not the authority of the individual no matter how smart that individual is like play doh or socrates or einstein 
ted_02032_0997880_1000470 the authority of the collective community 
ted_02032_1001040_1006110 can think of it as a kind of wisdom of the crowd but a very special kind of crowd 
ted_02032_1008060_1014310 science doesn't appeal to authority but it's not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be 
ted_02032_1014620_1023090 based on the collective wisdom the collective knowledge the collective work of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem 
ted_02032_1023560_1032940 scientists have a kind of cultural collective dish chest this show me culture illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence 
ted_02032_1033900_1037170 because these people don't really look like scientists because they are much too happy 
ted_02032_1041600_1043850 so i've brings me to my final point 
ted_02032_1045990_1048060 of us get up in the morning 
ted_02032_1048410_1049950 both of us trust our cars 
ted_02032_1049980_1061330 well i think i'm in manhattan this is a bad analogy but if you didn't most americans who don't live in manhattan get up in the morning and getting their cars and turn on the ignition and their cars work and they work incredibly well 
ted_02032_1061590_1064080 the modern automobile hardly ever breaks down 
ted_02032_1064450_1067060 so why is that why did cars works so well 
ted_02032_1067510_1072570 not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even ilan mask 
ted_02032_1073140_1083070 because the modern automobile is the product of more than one hundred years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people 
ted_02032_1083070_1096520 for modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort 
ted_02032_1097740_1107340 with benefit not just from the genius of bench and forward and mask but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car 
ted_02032_1108040_1111860 the same is true of science only sciences even older 
ted_02032_1112790_1124040 basis for justin science is actually the frame as our bases interest in technology and the same as the hour basis for trust in anything namely experience 
ted_02032_1124400_1128790 but it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have lie interest in anything 
ted_02032_1129300_1137020 our trust in science like science itself should be based on evidence and that means that scientists have to become better communicators 
ted_02032_1137260_1145300 we have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it and it means that we have to become better listeners 
ted_02032_1145860_1146700 thank you very much 
ted_02032_1146655_1146855 
ted_02073_0012290_0019670 so recently some white guys and from black women swap twitter avatars or pictures online 
ted_02073_0019940_0034620 but he didn't change their content that kept tweeting the same as usual but suddenly the white guys notice they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse whereas the black women and all of a sudden notice things got a lot more pleasant for them 
ted_02073_0035990_0050670 here might find your old your internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally ferries writing puppies that's a thing google it but the rest of us know that the internet can be a really ugly place 
ted_02073_0051180_0056030 i 'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that i think are healthy for our democracy 
ted_02073_0056720_0059540 when talking about nasty personal attacks 
ted_02073_0060070_0068150 maybe it's happened to you but it's at least twice as likely to happen and be worse if you're a woman a person of color are gay or more than one of the same time 
ted_02073_0068630_0087610 in fact just as i was writing this talk i found a twitter account called sally cone sucks the bio says that i'm a man hater in a bowl dyke and the only thing i've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality which incidentally is only a third correct 
ted_02073_0087660_0090050 law 
ted_02073_0093110_0095060 seriously we all say we hate this crap 
ted_02073_0095060_0099580 the question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it 
ted_02073_0100320_0101710 and i don't mean giving up the internet 
ted_02073_0102030_0106280 i mean changing the way you click because clicking is a public asked 
ted_02073_0107210_0113180 no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers 
ted_02073_0113340_0115630 increasingly we're all the media 
ted_02073_0116160_0123070 i used to think oh ok i get dressed up i put on a lot of makeup and go on television i talk about the news 
ted_02073_0123120_0125700 that is a public act of making media 
ted_02073_0126440_0131640 and then i go home and i browse the web and i'm reading twitter and a private actor consuming media 
ted_02073_0131640_0144200 of course it is i'm in my pajamas wrong everything we blog everything we tweet and everything we click is a public act of making media 
ted_02073_0145090_0146640 we are the new editors 
ted_02073_0146640_0150990 we decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to 
ted_02073_0151190_0152490 how the media works now 
ted_02073_0152490_0160910 all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on and that in turn shapes our whole culture 
ted_02073_0163030_0179000 over three out of five americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now but i'm going to guess that at least three out of five americans are clicking on the same insult oriented rumour mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society 
ted_02073_0180300_0192030 in an increasingly noisy media landscape the incentive is to make more noise to be heard and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty 
ted_02073_0193630_0199820 it does not have to be that way it does not we can change the incentives 
ted_02073_0200820_0202400 for starters there are two things we can all do 
ted_02073_0202410_0206530 first don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt 
ted_02073_0206540_0216350 if someone is being abused online do something be a hero this is your chance to speak up speak out be a good person drown out the negative with the positive 
ted_02073_0217070_0223610 second we got us there are clicking on the lowest common denominator bottom feeding link bait 
ted_02073_0224220_0233200 you don't like the twenty four seven all kardashians all the time programming you gotta stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian side boob 
ted_02073_0235190_0238550 i know you doing youtube apparently 
ted_02073_0239690_0247900 i mean really same example if you don't like politicians calling each other names start clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party 
ted_02073_0248250_0251050 clicking on a train wreck just poured gasoline on it 
ted_02073_0251090_0252950 it makes it worse the fire spreads 
ted_02073_0252950_0255710 our whole culture gets burned 
ted_02073_0257200_0270890 what gets the most clicks wins then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks because clicking is a public act so click responsibly thank you 
ted_02073_0270815_0271015 
ted_02212_0012990_0016360 but i'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture 
ted_02212_0017400_0024100 one hundred years ago we tend to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia that if they took hold would take us away quite quickly 
ted_02212_0024720_0032460 we tend to die at home in our own beds looked after by family that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care 
ted_02212_0033460_0036100 then in the twentieth century a lot of things changed 
ted_02212_0036450_0040490 we develop new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases 
ted_02212_0040970_0050960 new medical technologies like x ray machines to have invented and because they were so big and expensive we needed large centralized buildings to keep them in and they became our modern hospitals 
ted_02212_0051810_0057740 after the second world war a lot of countries setup universal health care system so that everyone who needed treatment could get 
ted_02212_0058470_0064290 the result was that lifespans extended from about forty five at the start of the country to almost double that today 
ted_02212_0064950_0074970 in the twentieth century it was this time a huge optimism about what science could offer but with all of the focus on life was forgotten even as our coach to change dramatically 
ted_02212_0075730_0082540 i'm an architect and for the past year and a half i've been looking at these changes and what they mean for architecture related to death and dying 
ted_02212_0083560_0091640 we now can die of cancer and heart disease and what that means is that many of us have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives 
ted_02212_0092160_0097790 during that period will likely spend a lot of time and hospitals and hospices and care homes 
ted_02212_0098480_0100400 we 've all been in a modern hospital 
ted_02212_0100690_0106590 those fluorescent light and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs 
ted_02212_0107090_0110400 hospital architecture has in its bad reputation 
ted_02212_0110870_0113530 but the surprising thing is it wasn't always like this 
ted_02212_0114220_0121480 hospital italian or chan keep built and fourteen one thousand nine by granola ski who was one of the most famous and influential architect to this time 
ted_02212_0122070_0128170 when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today what amazes me is that buildings ambition 
ted_02212_0128510_0129970 it 's just a really great building 
ted_02212_0129980_0138950 happy courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings so they just feel more comfortable to be 
ted_02212_0139420_0140600 but it's also beautiful 
ted_02212_0141150_0144340 somehow forgotten that that's even possible for the hospital 
ted_02212_0145170_0155870 if we want better buildings for dying then we have to talk about it but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable we don't talk about it and we don't question how we as a society approached 
ted_02212_0156780_0161390 one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are 
ted_02212_0162220_0166970 the first crematorium in the uk which was built in working under eighteen seventies 
ted_02212_0167420_0170310 when i was first built our protests and the local village 
ted_02212_0170730_0175330 commission wasn't socially acceptable and ninety nine point eight percent of people got buried 
ted_02212_0175680_0179280 and yet only one hundred years later three quarters of brisket committed 
ted_02212_0179740_0183560 people are actually really open to changing things if given the chance to talk about them 
ted_02212_0184530_0199410 this conversation about death and architecture was what i wanted to start when i did my first exhibition on it in venice in june which was called death in venice and it was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it 
ted_02212_0199730_0213750 is one of our exhibit switches an interactive map of london that shows just how much of the real estate and the city is given over to death and dying and as you wave your hand across the mock the name of that piece of real estate the building or cemetery is revealed 
ted_02212_0214580_0218820 i like the bits with a theme is a postcard that people could take away with them 
ted_02212_0219150_0228680 they showed people's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuary and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death 
ted_02212_0229460_0233810 we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die 
ted_02212_0235550_0241480 the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition especially the audio visual works 
ted_02212_0242100_0256190 we had people dancing on running and jumping as the tried to activate the exhibit different winds and at a certain point they would kind of stock and remember that there were in an exhibition about death and maybe that's not how you're supposed to act 
ted_02212_0256690_0274000 but actually i would question whether there is one way they're supposed to act around and if does not i'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like and might be a little less like this and a little more like this 
ted_02212_0274560_0275030 thank you 
ted_02212_0275515_0275715 
ted_02292_0012810_0017190 when your child anything and everything is possible 
ted_02292_0018160_0021440 the challenge so often is hanging on to that as we grow up 
ted_02292_0022680_0026430 and there's a four year old i had the opportunity to sail for the first time 
ted_02292_0027520_0031320 i will never forget the excitement as we close the coast 
ted_02292_0031780_0039360 i will never forget the feeling of adventure as i climbed on board the boat and said in her tiny cabin for the first time 
ted_02292_0039990_0046730 but the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom the feeling that i felt when we hoisted her sales 
ted_02292_0047240_0052690 as a four year old child it was the greatest sense of freedom that i could ever imagine 
ted_02292_0053440_0059070 i made my mind up there and then that one day somehow i was going to sail around the world 
ted_02292_0060600_0063320 so i did what i could in my life to get closer to that dream 
ted_02292_0064110_0066650 ten it was saving my school denouement a change 
ted_02292_0066910_0073410 every single day for eight years i had mashed potato and baked beans which costs for each and gravy was free 
ted_02292_0073980_0083060 every day i would pile up the change on the top of my money box and when that pile reached a pound i would drop it in and cross off one of one hundred squares are drawn on a piece of paper 
ted_02292_0084530_0086580 finally i bought a tiny dengue 
ted_02292_0087230_0091160 i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal 
ted_02292_0091290_0103370 i read every book i could on failing and then eventually having been told by my school i wasn't clever enough to be a bit left school aged seventeen to begin my apprenticeship and failing 
ted_02292_0104760_0113350 so imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who i knew could make that dream come true 
ted_02292_0114900_0119600 i fell on my life depended on that moment an incredibly he said yes 
ted_02292_0120640_0129230 i could barely contain my excitement as i sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which i was going to sail solo nonstop around the world 
ted_02292_0130550_0135060 from that first making to the finish line of the race it was everything i'd ever imagined 
ted_02292_0135590_0139090 just like in my dreams they were amazing parts and tough parts 
ted_02292_0139470_0141240 we missed an iceberg by twenty feet 
ted_02292_0141590_0144460 nine times i climbed to the top of a ninety foot mass 
ted_02292_0144890_0146900 we were blown on our side and the southern ocean 
ted_02292_0147250_0152820 but the thump that the wildlife and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking 
ted_02292_0153880_0158160 after three months at sea aged just twenty four i finished in second position 
ted_02292_0159380_0171770 i loved it so much so that within six months i decided to go around the world again but this time not into race to try to be the fastest person ever to sell solo nonstop round the world 
ted_02292_0172770_0178370 and for this i needed a different craft bigger wider faster more powerful 
ted_02292_0179220_0184230 and just to give that boat from scale i could climb inside her mashed all the way to the top 
ted_02292_0184820_0191420 seventy five foot long sixty foot wide i affectionately called her moby she was multihull 
ted_02292_0192370_0208310 when we built her no one had ever made it solo nonstop round the world in one though many have tried that whilst we built a frenchman took about twenty five percent bigger than her and not only did he make it but he took the record from ninety three days right down to seven 
ted_02292_0209590_0211400 the ball was now much much higher 
ted_02292_0212180_0213880 from these boats wrecks liking to sail 
ted_02292_0214070_0220950 it was a training sale of the french coast this i know well because i was one of the five crew members on board 
ted_02292_0221070_0230190 five seconds is all it took from everything being fined to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater and that five seconds goes quickly 
ted_02292_0230610_0232980 see how far below those guys to fears 
ted_02292_0233660_0240640 imagine that alone in the southern ocean plunged into icy water thousands of miles away from land 
ted_02292_0243300_0247430 it was christmas day i was forging in southern ocean underneath australia 
ted_02292_0248940_0250310 the conditions were horrendous 
ted_02292_0252010_0255990 it was approaching a part in the ocean which was two thousand miles away from the nearest 
ted_02292_0256000_0265980 a town the nearest land was antarctica and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me you really are in the middle 
ted_02292_0267370_0276580 if you need help and you're still alive it takes four days for ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port 
ted_02292_0277120_0280350 helicopter can reach you out there and no planes can land 
ted_02292_0281470_0284180 we are forging ahead of a huge storm 
ted_02292_0285160_0290140 within it there was eighty knots of wind which was far too much wind for the boat and to cope with 
ted_02292_0290150_0297880 ways we're already forty to fifty feet high and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard 
ted_02292_0298910_0304710 if we didn't fail fast enough we'd be engulfed by that storm and either capsized or smashed to pieces 
ted_02292_0305440_0310430 will quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge 
ted_02292_0311560_0314610 speed i so desperately needed brought with it danger 
ted_02292_0315440_0323630 we all know what it's like driving a car twenty miles an hour thirty forty it's not too stressful we can concentrate we can turn on the radio 
ted_02292_0323980_0328550 take that to fifty sixty seventy accelerate through to eight hundred and ninety one hundred miles an hour 
ted_02292_0328800_0331480 now you have white knuckles and you gripping the steering wheel 
ted_02292_0331850_0338170 take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers the windscreen the headlights and the brakes 
ted_02292_0338360_0349830 but that's what it's like in the southern ocean you can imagine it will be quite difficult to sleep in that situation even at the passenger 
ted_02292_0349910_0351750 but you're not a passenger 
ted_02292_0351800_0357150 we are alone on a boat you can barely stand up and and you have to make every single decision on board 
ted_02292_0357190_0359990 i was absolutely exhausted physically and mentally 
ted_02292_0360490_0362270 fell changes in twelve hours 
ted_02292_0362520_0372300 the main shall wait three times my body weight and after each change i would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with a freezing southern ocean air burning the back of my throat 
ted_02292_0373680_0378900 but out there those lowest of lows are so often contrasted with the highest of highs 
ted_02292_0379670_0382960 a few days later we came out of the back of the low 
ted_02292_0383800_0388500 against all odds we've been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression 
ted_02292_0389510_0399490 sky cleared the rain stopped and in a heartbeat the monster seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains 
ted_02292_0400190_0404650 it's hard to explain but you enter a different mode when you head out there 
ted_02292_0404650_0409240 voters your entire world and what you take with you when you leave is all you have 
ted_02292_0410050_0417420 if i said you will now go off into vancouver and find everything that you will need for your survival for the next three months that's quite a task 
ted_02292_0418200_0422320 about food fuel clothes even toilet roll and toothpaste 
ted_02292_0423000_0429000 and that's what we do and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food 
ted_02292_0429750_0437530 no experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word finite what we have out there is all we have 
ted_02292_0437770_0438680 there is no more 
ted_02292_0439500_0458130 never in life would i ever translated that definition of finite that i felt on board to anything outside of sailing until i stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record suddenly i connected the dots 
ted_02292_0458940_0460810 global economy is no different 
ted_02292_0461840_0466280 entirely dependent on find out materials we only have once in the history of humanity 
ted_02292_0467380_0481280 and it was a bit like saying something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices either put that stone to one side and learn more about it or i put that stone back and i carried on with my dream job of sailing around the world 
ted_02292_0482580_0494100 i chose the first i put it to one side and i began anew journey of learning speaking chief executives expert scientists economists to try and understand just how our global economy works 
ted_02292_0494770_0497960 when my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places 
ted_02292_0498430_0501850 this photo was taken in the burning of coal fired power station 
ted_02292_0502630_0508440 it was fascinated by coal fundamental to our global energy needs but also very close to my family 
ted_02292_0509310_0514060 and my great grandfather was a coal miner and he spent fifty years of his life underground 
ted_02292_0515170_0519980 is a photo of him and when you see that photo you see someone from another era 
ted_02292_0520990_0531170 no one wears the trousers with the waistband quite that high in this day and age but yet that's me with my great grandfather and by the way they are not he's really is 
ted_02292_0533350_0537090 we were close i remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining story 
ted_02292_0537550_0545430 he talked to the camaraderie on the ground and the fact that the mind is used to save the cross of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they've worked with underground 
ted_02292_0546880_0548090 it was like it was yesterday 
ted_02292_0548740_0563870 my journey of learning i went to the world coal association website and there in the middle of the home pages said we have about one hundred and eighteen years of coal left and i thought to myself well as well outside my lifetime and a much greater figure that the predictions for oil 
ted_02292_0564270_0577990 but i did the math and i realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly one hundred and eighteen years before that year and i sat on his nathan i was eleven years old and i realize it's nothing in time in history 
ted_02292_0578830_0588950 it made me make the decision i never thought i would make to leave the sport of solar sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge i'd ever come across the future of our global economy 
ted_02292_0590040_0592220 i quickly realized it wasn't just about energy 
ted_02292_0592590_0593790 it was also materials 
ted_02292_0594080_0604970 in two thousand and eight i picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have a valuable materials we extract from the ground copper sixty one tenzing forty filled with when 
ted_02292_0605880_0609260 these figures couldn't be exact but we knew those materials were finite 
ted_02292_0609580_0610860 we only have them once 
ted_02292_0611270_0616120 and yet our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly exponentially 
ted_02292_0616560_0624630 with more people in the world with more stuff with effectively seen one hundred years of price declines in those basic commodities are raised in just ten years 
ted_02292_0625360_0626720 this affects all of us 
ted_02292_0627170_0644180 brought huge volatility and prices so much so that in two thousand and eleven your average european car manufacturer so a raw material price increase a five hundred million euros wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over 
ted_02292_0645040_0647960 the more i learned the more i started to change my own life 
ted_02292_0648520_0650780 and i started traveling last doing less using left 
ted_02292_0650840_0653430 it felt like actually doing less was what we have to do 
ted_02292_0654210_0655640 he sat uneasily with me 
ted_02292_0656230_0657410 it didn't feel right 
ted_02292_0657940_0660190 we felt like we were buying ourselves time 
ted_02292_0660480_0662140 we were eating things out a bit longer 
ted_02292_0662160_0665310 even if everybody change it wouldn't solve the problem 
ted_02292_0665470_0666820 wouldn't fix the system 
ted_02292_0667490_0671870 it was vital in the transition but what fascinated me was in the transition to one 
ted_02292_0671930_0673980 what could actually work 
ted_02292_0675730_0691290 it struck me that the system itself the framework within which we live is fundamentally flawed and i realized ultimately that are operating system the way our economy functions were economy's been built a system in itself 
ted_02292_0691310_0693970 see i have to understand complex systems 
ted_02292_0694280_0699800 take multiple inputs i had to process them to understand the system to win 
ted_02292_0700010_0701230 to make sense of it 
ted_02292_0702300_0709690 they look to the global economy i realized it too is that system but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term 
ted_02292_0710840_0728550 when i realized we'd been perfecting what's effectively and a linear economy for one hundred and fifty years where we take a material out of the ground we make something out of it and then ultimately that product gets thrown away and yet we do recycled some of it but more and attempt to get out what we can at the end not by design 
ted_02292_0729780_0740150 an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term and if we know that we have finite materials why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up that would create waste 
ted_02292_0740720_0747290 life itself has existed for billions of years and is continually adapted to use materials effectively 
ted_02292_0747300_0756250 a complex system that within it there is no waste everything is metabolized it's not a linear economy at all but circular 
ted_02292_0756260_0760460 and i felt like the child in a garden 
ted_02292_0760940_0765160 for the first time on this new journey i could see exactly where we were headed 
ted_02292_0765720_0776270 we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up we could build a future that really could work in the long term i was excited this was something to work towards 
ted_02292_0776680_0778100 we knew exactly where we were headed 
ted_02292_0778100_0785560 we just had to work out how to get there and it was exactly this in mind that we create the ellen macarthur foundation in september two thousand and ten 
ted_02292_0787430_0797810 in many schools of thought fed are thinking and pointed to this model industrial symbiosis performance economy sharing economy biomimicry and of course cradle to cradle design 
ted_02292_0798850_0809840 material who'd be defined as either technical or biological waste would be designed out entirely and we'd have a system that could function absolutely in the long term 
ted_02292_0810240_0811970 so what could this economy looked like 
ted_02292_0813220_0822010 maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings but we'd pay for service of light and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products 
ted_02292_0822720_0826980 what if packaging was so non toxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink 
ted_02292_0827090_0828430 it would never become waste 
ted_02292_0829130_0835240 what if engines will re manufacturable and we could recover the components materials and significantly reduce energy demands 
ted_02292_0835930_0842730 what if we could recover components from circuit boards we utilize them and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage 
ted_02292_0843410_0853690 what if we could collect food waste human waste what if we could turn that into fertilizer heat energy ultimately reconnecting nutrient systems and rebuilding natural capital 
ted_02292_0854780_0859490 because we wanted to move around we don't need to own the materials within 
ted_02292_0860270_0863890 could cause become a service providers with mobility in the future 
ted_02292_0865140_0871660 all of this sounds amazing but you don't just ideas that real today and these lie at the forefront of the secular economy 
ted_02292_0871860_0875650 what lies before us to expand them and scale them up 
ted_02292_0876680_0878990 so how would you shift from linear circular 
ted_02292_0880180_0889590 came in at the foundation for what you might want to work with the top universities in the world with leading businesses within the world with the biggest convening platforms in the world and with governments 
ted_02292_0890410_0900860 we thought you might want to work with the best unless and asking the question can the second economy decouple growth from resource constraints is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital 
ted_02292_0901070_0913360 could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use yes was the answer to the decoupling but also yes we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering two point seven times 
ted_02292_0914500_0919720 what inspired me most about the circular economy was his ability to inspire young people 
ted_02292_0920700_0927700 when young people see the economies to a secular lens they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon 
ted_02292_0928480_0937660 so they can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system and it's there for the taking right now and the faster we do this the better 
ted_02292_0938220_0940670 so could we achieve this in their lifetime 
ted_02292_0941080_0948570 actually possible i believe yes when you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather anything's possible 
ted_02292_0949480_0954560 when he was born there were only twenty five cars in the world that only just been invented 
ted_02292_0955450_0959140 when he was fourteen we flew for the first time in history 
ted_02292_0959750_0962810 a one hundred thousand charter flights every single 
ted_02292_0962830_0967030 when he was forty five we built 
ted_02292_0968050_0976300 when he said it wouldn't catch on but it did in just twenty years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands of in this room here today 
ted_02292_0977620_0980380 years before he died we built the first mobile phone 
ted_02292_0980380_0987640 it wasn't that mobile to be fair but now it really is and as my great grandfather left to surf the internet arrived 
ted_02292_0988460_0992600 and now we can do anything but more importantly now we have a plan 
ted_02292_0993670_0994030 thank you 
ted_02292_1004960_1005160 applause 
ted_02440_0012910_0017360 what started as a platform for hobbyists this poised to become a multi billion dollar industry 
ted_02440_0017900_0029270 inspection environmental monitoring photography and film and journalism these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones and their enablers or the capabilities being developed and research facilities around the world 
ted_02440_0029750_0044710 for example before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness and autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of fifty five hundred bricks in front of a live audience and the frac center in france and several years ago he started to fly 
ted_02440_0044720_0049880 ropes by tethering flying machine they can achieve high speed acceleration in very tight 
ted_02440_0051010_0053660 we can also autonomously build pencil structures 
ted_02440_0054160_0060480 skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world 
ted_02440_0061140_0063980 today we want to show you some new project that we've been working on 
ted_02440_0064470_0068440 their aim is to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with autonomous flight 
ted_02440_0069020_0075370 for a system to function autonomously it must collectively know the location of its mobile object in space 
ted_02440_0076000_0084980 back at our lab at zurich we often use external cameras to locate objects which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks 
ted_02440_0085490_0091930 for the demos you will see today however we will use new localization technology developed by various studios a spin off from our lab 
ted_02440_0092510_0093910 there are no external cameras 
ted_02440_0094150_0102480 each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space in onboard computation to determine what it factions should be 
ted_02440_0103280_0106700 external commands or high level one such as take off and land 
ted_02440_0130500_0131950 this is a so called tail theater 
ted_02440_0132440_0135210 an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it 
ted_02440_0135960_0141870 unlike other fixed wing aircraft it is efficient and forward flight much more so than helicopters and variations 
ted_02440_0142440_0150760 unlike most other fixed wing aircraft however it is capable of hovering which has huge advantages for takeoff or landing and general versatility 
ted_02440_0151470_0153090 there is no free lunch unfortunately 
ted_02440_0153580_0157630 one of the limitations retail sitters are susceptible to disturbances such as wind gust 
ted_02440_0158220_0162040 we're developing a new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation 
ted_02440_0166980_0185940 the ideas for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in practice improve its performance over time 
ted_02440_0193735_0193935 
ted_02440_0202030_0202380 
ted_02440_0207620_0219670 when doing research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of the matter 
ted_02440_0221210_0227050 for example one such question would be what does the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight 
ted_02440_0227520_0231010 there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question 
ted_02440_0231580_0239320 helicopters for example are affectionately known as machine one thousand moving parts are conspiring to do you bodily harm 
ted_02440_0240640_0249320 it turns out that decade ago skilled pilot were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts a propeller and a tail rudder 
ted_02440_0250000_0252740 we recently discovered that it can be done with just one 
ted_02440_0253610_0259450 is the model spinner in the world mechanically simplest controlled the flying machine invented just a few months ago 
ted_02440_0259980_0262490 it has only one moving part a propeller 
ted_02440_0263060_0270400 it has no flaps no hinges no ailerons no other actuators no other control surfaces just a simple propeller 
ted_02440_0271350_0279730 even though it's mechanically simple there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space 
ted_02440_0280130_0287370 even so it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail sitter which means that in order to get to fly i have to throw it just right 
ted_02440_0288850_0297220 and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low given everybody watching me where we're going to do instead to show you a video that we shall last night 
ted_02440_0303705_0303905 applause 
ted_02440_0303820_0304020 
ted_02440_0323090_0332170 if the model spinner is an exercise in frugality this machine here the army copter with a propellers is an exercise in excess 
ted_02440_0332930_0334450 what can you do with all the surplus 
ted_02440_0335080_0337210 one thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric 
ted_02440_0337940_0340330 as a result it is ambivalent orientation 
ted_02440_0340800_0343090 gives it an extraordinary capability 
ted_02440_0343530_0350200 it can move anywhere he wants in space irrespective of how it where it is facing and even of howard is rotating 
ted_02440_0351030_0356190 has its own complexities mainly having to do with the interacting flows from a tape propellers 
ted_02440_0356700_0361150 some of this can be modeled while the rest can be burned on the fly let's take a look 
ted_02440_0376345_0376545 
ted_02440_0376470_0417790 flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives they will need to become extremely safe and reliable 
ted_02440_0418780_0422950 machine over here is actually two separate to propeller flying machines 
ted_02440_0423320_0424950 one wants to spend clockwise 
ted_02440_0425000_0427180 sutherland wants to spin counterclockwise 
ted_02440_0427580_0438550 when you put them together they behave like one high performance quadrocopters 
ted_02440_0441050_0452630 if anything goes wrong however a motor fail a propeller fail electronics even a battery pack the machine can supply albeit on the green fashion 
ted_02440_0453150_0456110 we're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of attack 
ted_02440_0470695_0470895 
ted_02440_0470980_0486940 this last administration is an exploration of synthetic swarms 
ted_02440_0487550_0492710 the large number of autonomous coordinated entities offers a new polet for aesthetic expression 
ted_02440_0493300_0502250 with taken commercially available micro quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread by the way and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms 
ted_02440_0502830_0507790 because each unit knows where it is in space and self controlled there is really no limit to 
ted_02440_0637420_0641240 motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines 
ted_02440_0642590_0647390 ultra safe on over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on broadway 
ted_02440_0648555_0648755 
ted_02440_0648680_0653630 the reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nasa technology 
ted_02440_0654130_0658470 for folks like us the real reward is the journey in the act of creation 
ted_02440_0658960_0669160 the continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is that it allows created a clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways 
ted_02440_0669780_0676280 but the fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake 
ted_02440_0676470_0677320 thank you 
ted_02440_0677245_0677445 
ted_02567_0012870_0022540 the big question at the center of life in our democracy today how do we fight terror without destroying democracies without trampling human rights 
ted_02567_0023580_0053600 spent much of my career working with journalists with bloggers with activists with human rights researchers all around the world and i've come to the conclusion that is our democratic societies do not gobbled down on protecting and defending human rights freedom of the press and a free and open internet radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist 
ted_02567_0054035_0054235 
ted_02567_0057090_0059120 thank you very much gesture 
ted_02567_0059045_0059245 applause 
ted_02567_0061690_0063710 they want to drill down on a little bit 
ted_02567_0064940_0077900 so one of the countries that has been on the front lines of this issue is tunisian which was the only country to come out of the arab spring with a successful democratic revolution 
ted_02567_0078890_0085520 five years later they're struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment 
ted_02567_0085900_0091120 many tunisians are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe 
ted_02567_0093240_0104850 cartoonist naughty and caring has summed up the situation with this character he says i don't give a damn about human rights i don't give a damn about the revolution 
ted_02567_0113650_0117530 satisfy his jailer you're safe now 
ted_02567_0118930_0130390 the tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in this place it will be a model not only for their region but for all of us 
ted_02567_0132390_0145430 reality is that civil society journalists and activists are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand and in many countries also from their own governments 
ted_02567_0145480_0155090 we're seeing bloggers and journalists been jailed charge and intimidated by their own governments many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror 
ted_02567_0155750_0166500 in just three examples a friend and former colleague of mine his on a moron has been charged with threatening state security along with six other activists in morocco 
ted_02567_0167110_0176910 saudi blogger re badawi has been jailed and longed for insulting islam and criticizing the saudi regime on his blog 
ted_02567_0177430_0193250 more recently the turkish representative for reporters without borders arrow on the olu has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda because he and some other activists have been supporting kurdish 
ted_02567_0193290_0208800 media anti terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities and for peaceful debate this needs to be supported by a robust independent local 
ted_02567_0209730_0225580 while that's not really happening washington is teaming up with silicon valley and with hollywood to poor millions hundreds of millions of dollars into what's called counter and managing a fancy word for propaganda 
ted_02567_0226060_0241330 to counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet in europe internet referral units are being set up so that people can report on extremists content that they find and get it sensor 
ted_02567_0242160_0273960 the problem is that all of this propaganda monitoring censorship completely fails to make up for the fact that the people who are the most credible voices who can present credible ideas an alternative solutions to real economic social and political problems in their community that are causing people to term to to turn to extremism in the first place are being silenced by their own governments 
ted_02567_0274220_0278650 is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world 
ted_02567_0279770_0290160 freedom house the human rights organization reports that two thousand and fifteen march that can straight year in a row of decline in freedom worldwide 
ted_02567_0290520_0294920 this is not just because the actions of authoritarian governments 
ted_02567_0294950_0304470 also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down on dissenters whistleblowers an investigative journalists 
ted_02567_0304880_0320310 secretary general banking moon has warned that preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand in hand it's not to say that governments shouldn't keep the strength of course they should but we need public oversight transparency and accountability to the rule of law 
ted_02567_0320740_0326170 meanwhile extremists are literally killing off civil society in some countries 
ted_02567_0326220_0337970 since two thousand and thirteen in bangladesh over a dozen secular bloggers and community activists have been literally slaughtered by extremists while the government has done very little 
ted_02567_0338920_0349260 from the city of rocker in syria people like rookie hassan naji jurors have been assassinated for their reporting out of isis controlled territory 
ted_02567_0350290_0363340 citizen meeting a group called rocca is being slaughtered silently relies on strong encryption to send out their reports and shield themselves from interception and surveillance 
ted_02567_0364030_0377490 yet authorities in countries like the united states the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption because the bad guys are using it to 
ted_02567_0378460_0382160 we have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption 
ted_02567_0382740_0390120 otherwise descent an investigative journalism is going to become even more difficult and even more places 
ted_02567_0390670_0394850 the bad guys the criminals and terrorists are still going to find ways to communicate 
ted_02567_0395390_0400130 kudos to the companies that are standing up for their users right to use encryption 
ted_02567_0401580_0405960 when it comes to censorship the picture is much more troubling 
ted_02567_0406580_0411380 yes there's a real problem of extremists content stretch spreading all over the internet 
ted_02567_0411710_0423370 facebook youtube and twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and d activating accounts connected to the extremists speech 
ted_02567_0423690_0429940 the problem is they're enforcement mechanisms are complete black box and there is collateral damage 
ted_02567_0430120_0435950 take for example i had about daddy and activists who makes fun of isis on twitter 
ted_02567_0435960_0441290 how does that count deactivated because he shares a surname with a prominent isis leader 
ted_02567_0442200_0450100 last december a number of women named isis which also happens to be the name of an egyptian goddess had their accounts deactivated 
ted_02567_0450720_0462340 and this woman who lives in the united states and as a computer programmer reported on twitter about her activation on facebook managed to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated 
ted_02567_0462940_0465090 but that's the thing she had to get media attention 
ted_02567_0465980_0467340 journalists aren't immune 
ted_02567_0467530_0485260 david thompson an expert on terrorism and reporter for radio france international had reports deleted from his facebook account and had his account deactivated for several days because they contained pictures of isis flat even though he was just reporting on isis not promoting 
ted_02567_0486260_0516620 and then we have stories from people like this egyptian man ahmed abdulahi who reported recently in a event in washington d c there's some of his arguments with the extremists who now spends his time on social media arguing with ice his followers trying to get turn them away and some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted which he believes has the effect of shielding them from alternative points of view 
ted_02567_0518180_0525800 it's unclear whether facebook even knows the extent of the collateral damage or the other companies as well 
ted_02567_0526500_0533900 but we do know that journalism activism and public debate are being silenced and the effort to stamp out as extremists speech 
ted_02567_0535320_0540980 so with these companies having so much power over the public discourse they need to be held accountable 
ted_02567_0541230_0548490 they need to hold carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems that were clearly seeing 
ted_02567_0548690_0558150 they need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms and they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanism so people can get their content reinstated 
ted_02567_0558630_0567250 and now i've been talking for the last ten minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these 
ted_02567_0567350_0575590 this is a picture of members of the citizen media network global voices that i hoped to co founded over ten years ago with my friend ethan zuckerman 
ted_02567_0576160_0590800 interestingly about five years ago right after the arab spring the data scientists gilad low time created a network map of the people in global voices who were heavy users of twitter during the arab spring 
ted_02567_0591230_0600900 he found that many of these people served his key information nodes between activists journalists throughout the tunisian and egyptian revolution 
ted_02567_0601370_0608950 we've got to make sure that these people not only survive but are able to continue to thrive 
ted_02567_0609180_0615680 many of them are still active other than the ones that have gone to jail or have been driven into hiding or exile 
ted_02567_0616640_0624860 all around the world people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression are linking up in their communities and across borders 
ted_02567_0625290_0632220 we've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies to do a better job of protecting their rights 
ted_02567_0632520_0641830 we've also got to be more mindful about how our own personal political consumer and business choices affect people like these around the world 
ted_02567_0643060_0648600 also if you follow the news it's pretty clear that that alone isn't going to be enough 
ted_02567_0649690_0670900 we've got to take personal responsibility by joining or at very least actively supporting the growing ecosystem of individuals and groups who are fighting for social justice environmental sustainability government accountability human rights freedom of the press and a free and open internet all around the world 
ted_02567_0671490_0682560 i believe that ultimately we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism demagoguery and hate 
ted_02567_0683350_0704970 but we've got to do this i really beefing up the global networks of citizens around the world powered by people who are working hard every day and taking personal risk for a future world that is more peaceful just open and free 
ted_02567_0705490_0706360 thanks very much for 
ted_02675_0012630_0021240 one summer afternoon in two thousand and thirteen dc police detained question and searched a man who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous 
ted_02675_0022280_0026490 wasn't what i was wearing the day of the detention to be fair but i have a picture of that as well 
ted_02675_0027560_0029900 and it's very frightening try to remain calm 
ted_02675_0030590_0030790 
ted_02675_0032650_0038790 but this time hours in turning the public defender service in washington d c and i was visiting a police station for work 
ted_02675_0039120_0046120 i was on my way out and before i could make it to my car to police cars pulled up to block my exit and an officer approached me from behind 
ted_02675_0046890_0052040 he told me to stop take my backpack off and put my hand on the police car parked next to us 
ted_02675_0052710_0055150 about a dozen officers than gathered near us 
ted_02675_0060060_0064490 patted me down they took pictures of me spread on the police car and they laughed 
ted_02675_0064860_0073640 this was happening and that was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs trying to think clearly about what i should do something stuck out to me as odd 
ted_02675_0074350_0087280 look at myself in this photo if our to describe myself i think i'd say something like nineteen year old indian male bright t shirt wearing glasses but they weren't including any of these details 
ted_02675_0087280_0092000 into their police radios as they describe me they kept saying middle eastern male with a backpack 
ted_02675_0092080_0097230 for middle eastern male with a backpack and this description carried on into their police reports 
ted_02675_0098400_0110560 i never expected to be described on my own government in these terms lurking nefarious terrorist and the detention dragged on like this 
ted_02675_0110560_0114770 they sent dogs trained to smile explosives to sweep the area i'd been 
ted_02675_0114780_0117870 they call the federal government to see if i was on and you watch list 
ted_02675_0117870_0125160 they spent a couple of detectives to cross examined me on why if i claimed i had nothing to hide i wouldn't consent to a search and my car 
ted_02675_0125260_0130310 and i could see they weren't happy with me but i felt i had no way of knowing what they'd want to do next 
ted_02675_0130530_0139350 one point the officer who patted me down scan the side of the police station can see where the security camera was to see how much of this was being recorded 
ted_02675_0139910_0143840 and when he did that it really think and how completely hours at their mercy 
ted_02675_0144640_0157300 and i think we're all normalized from a young age to the idea of police officers and arrest in handcuffs so it's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive the thing it is to seize control over another person's body 
ted_02675_0157310_0165170 i know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated i was because in my race and yes i don't think i would have been detained if i were white 
ted_02675_0165170_0167200 but actually what i had in mind today something else 
ted_02675_0167470_0171620 what i have in mind is how much worse things might have been if i weren't affluent 
ted_02675_0172020_0181490 i mean they thought i might be trying to plant and explosive and they investigated that possibility for an hour and a half but i was never put in handcuffs i've never taken to a jail cell 
ted_02675_0182040_0189980 but i think of our from one of washington d c poor communities of color and they thought i was endangering officers lives things might have ended differently 
ted_02675_0189980_0200230 and in fact in our system i think it's better to be an affluent person suspected of trying to blow up a police station than it is to be a poor person who suspected of much much less than this 
ted_02675_0200360_0202480 give you an example from my current work 
ted_02675_0203260_0208230 right now i'm working at a civil rights organization in d c called equal justice under law 
ted_02675_0208850_0211500 let me start by asking your question 
ted_02675_0211830_0223070 how many of you have ever gotten parking ticket in your life raise your hand survey and when i had to pay it felt annoying and felt bad but i paid it and i moved on 
ted_02675_0223320_0225580 and i'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well 
ted_02675_0226560_0233150 but what would happen if you couldn't afford the amount on the ticket and your family doesn't have the money either what happens then 
ted_02675_0234000_0241230 well one thing that's not supposed to happen under the law is you're not supposed to be arrested and jailed complete because you can't afford to pay 
ted_02675_0241320_0242860 illegal under federal law 
ted_02675_0243150_0246700 but that's what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor 
ted_02675_0247180_0252380 so many of our lawsuit that equal justice under law target these modern day debtors prisons 
ted_02675_0253720_0256180 one of our cases is against ferguson missouri 
ted_02675_0256400_0260320 i know when i say ferguson many of you will think of police violence 
ted_02675_0260350_0265580 but today i want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens 
ted_02675_0266210_0273960 ferguson was issuing an average of over to arrest warrants per person per year mostly for unpaid that to the court 
ted_02675_0274940_0289240 when i imagine what that would feel like if every time i left my house there was a chance of police officer would run my license plate she a warrant for unpaid get sees my body and the way they did in dc and then take me to a jail so i feel a little sick 
ted_02675_0290950_0295050 many of the people and ferguson who have experienced this and i've heard some of their stories 
ted_02675_0295730_0302600 and ferguson's jail in each small cell there's a bunk bed and a toilet but they'd pack for people into each cell 
ted_02675_0302600_0309440 be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet which was never cleaned 
ted_02675_0309670_0315280 and in fact the whole cell was never cleaned so the floor and the walls are lined with blood and mucus 
ted_02675_0316050_0319780 water to drink except coming out of a spigot connected to the toilet 
ted_02675_0319810_0329140 underwater looked and tasted dirty there is never enough food never any showers women men straining without any hygiene products no medical attention whatsoever 
ted_02675_0329250_0333560 when i asked a woman about medical attention she laughed and she said oh no no 
ted_02675_0333920_0336530 beyond the attention you get from the guards in their sexual 
ted_02675_0337740_0349720 so they take the data to this place and they'd say we're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt and if you could if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money then maybe you are out 
ted_02675_0350280_0351580 it was enough money you're out 
ted_02675_0352470_0361660 but if it wasn't then you'd stay there for days or weeks and every day the guards would come down to the cells and haggle with the debtors about the price of relief that day 
ted_02675_0362760_0368120 and each day until at some point the gel rebook to capacity and they'd want to book someone new 
ted_02675_0368140_0376680 and at that point they'd think ok at unlike in this person can come up with the money it's more likely this new person well you're out there in the machine kept moving like that 
ted_02675_0377930_0383750 i met a man who nine years ago was arrested for panhandling and a walgreens 
ted_02675_0384140_0387650 he couldn't afford his fines and his court fees from that case 
ted_02675_0388330_0394120 when he was young he survived a house fire only because he jumped out the third story window to escape 
ted_02675_0394150_0398410 but that fall left him with damage to his brain and several parts of his body including his leg 
ted_02675_0398430_0402150 so you can't work and relies on social security payments to survive 
ted_02675_0402630_0406970 when i met him in his apartment he had nothing of value they're not even food in his fridge 
ted_02675_0406970_0407930 is chronically hungry 
ted_02675_0407930_0416290 we had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard on which he'd written the names of his children he cherishes a lot he was happy to show it to 
ted_02675_0416290_0419580 but he can't pay to find and fees because he has nothing to give 
ted_02675_0419970_0427460 in the last nine years he has been arrested thirteen times and jailed for a total of one hundred and thirty days on that panhandling case 
ted_02675_0428610_0431220 one of those stretches lasted forty five days 
ted_02675_0431720_0438290 so just imagine spending from right now until sometime in june in the place that i described to you a few moments ago 
ted_02675_0440520_0454840 he told me about all the suicide attempts he's seen in ferguson's jail about the time a man found a way to hang himself out of reach of the other inmates so all they could do was yell and yell and yell trying to get the guards attention they said they could come down and cut them down 
ted_02675_0455380_0460920 he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond and when they came the man was unconscious 
ted_02675_0461290_0463790 they called the paramedics and the paramedics meant to the cell 
ted_02675_0464140_0467160 and they said he'll be ok statist left him there on the floor 
ted_02675_0468100_0474440 i heard many stories like this nation have surprised me because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails 
ted_02675_0475830_0478570 is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails 
ted_02675_0478610_0482110 i met a woman single mother of three making seven dollars an hour 
ted_02675_0482700_0485260 relies on food stamps to feed yourself and your children 
ted_02675_0486360_0493810 about a decade ago she got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge and she can't afford refined and fees on those cases 
ted_02675_0494840_0502200 since then she has been jailed about ten times on those cases but she has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and she needs medication every day 
ted_02675_0502660_0506890 if she doesn't have access those medications and ferguson's job and no one has access to their medications 
ted_02675_0507260_0518860 he told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage hallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices begging for the medication that would make it all stop only to be ignored 
ted_02675_0520320_0530590 this isn't anomalous either thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs just like hers but only one in six receive any mental health care while in jail 
ted_02675_0531440_0545540 and so i heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon the forgotten was operating for its debtors and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go and visit ferguson's jail i'm not sure what i was expecting to see but i wasn't expecting death 
ted_02675_0546320_0547750 ordinary government buildings 
ted_02675_0547750_0550280 could be a post office or a school 
ted_02675_0550340_0559170 and it reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes aren't being run somewhere in the shadows they're being run out in the open by our public officials 
ted_02675_0559170_0560630 matter of public policy 
ted_02675_0561090_0568950 this reminded me that poverty jailing in general even outside the debtors prison context placing very visible in central role in our justice system 
ted_02675_0569740_0571810 what i have in mind is our policy of veil 
ted_02675_0572010_0579700 our system whether you're detained are free pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight rescue pose 
ted_02675_0579970_0582290 as a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail them out 
ted_02675_0582580_0594740 so bill cosby whose bill was set in a million dollars immediately write the check and then the second in a jail cell sandra bland who died in jail but only there because her family was unable to come up with five hundred dollars 
ted_02675_0595270_0602270 in fact there are half a million sandra bland across the country five hundred thousand people who are in jail right now only because they can't afford their veils 
ted_02675_0602270_0611910 and we're told that our jails are places for criminals but statistically that's not the case three out of every five people in jail right now are there 
ted_02675_0611910_0616770 pre trial they haven't been convicted of any crime they haven't pled guilty 
ted_02675_0618310_0624470 right here in san francisco eighty five percent of the inmates in our jail in san francisco are pre trial detainees 
ted_02675_0624870_0630870 this means san francisco is spending something like eighty million dollars every year to fund pre trial detention 
ted_02675_0633740_0649580 many of these people who are in jail only because they can't post bale are facing allegations so minor that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial is longer than descent instead receivers convicted which means they are guaranteed to get out faster if they just plead guilty 
ted_02675_0650060_0660440 for now the choices should stay here in this horrible place away from my family my dependent almost guaranteed to lose my job and then fight the charges 
ted_02675_0660730_0663370 portraitist plead guilty to wherever the prosecutor wants and get out 
ted_02675_0663720_0666270 at this point their pre trial detainees not criminals 
ted_02675_0666330_0673950 once they take that deal will call them criminals even though an affluent person would never have been in this situation because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out 
ted_02675_0676100_0681010 a display you might be wondering disguising the inspiration section 
ted_02675_0680955_0681155 applause 
ted_02675_0681080_0685300 it 's extremely depressed and i want my money impact 
ted_02675_0686525_0686725 
ted_02675_0686700_0702430 but in actuality i find talking about gelling much less depressing than the alternative because i think if we don't talk about these issues and collectively change how we think about jailing at the end of all of our lives will still have jails full of poor people who don't belong there 
ted_02675_0702450_0703860 that really is depressing to me 
ted_02675_0704350_0709780 both exciting to me is the thought that these stories can move us to think about jailing and different terms 
ted_02675_0710010_0716520 sterile policy terms like mass incarceration or sentencing of non violent offenders but in human terms 
ted_02675_0716730_0724990 when we put a human being in a cage free days or weeks or months or even years what are we doing to that person's mind and body 
ted_02675_0725220_0727670 under what conditions are really willing to do that 
ted_02675_0728530_0737270 starting with a few hundred of us in this room we can commit to thinking about jailing and this different light and we can undo that normalization i was referring to earlier 
ted_02675_0737910_0752420 if i leave you with anything today i hope it's with the thought that if we want anything to fundamentally change not just to reform our policies on fail and finds and fees but also to make sure that whatever new policies replace those don't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way 
ted_02675_0752600_0756790 if we want that kind of change in this shift in thinking is required of each of us 
ted_02675_0757130_0757420 thank you 
ted_02675_0761845_0762045 
ted_02724_0012790_0014530 lower pay you what your work 
ted_02724_0017930_0021190 and no one will ever pay you for your worth 
ted_02724_0023870_0026900 will only ever pay you what they think your work 
ted_02724_0028430_0034540 you control their thinking now like this although that would be cool 
ted_02724_0034475_0034675 
ted_02724_0036580_0047620 it would be really cool and fed like this clearly defining in communicating your value are essential to being paid well for your excellent 
ted_02724_0048810_0054060 here i want to be paid well ok good and as stark as for everyone 
ted_02724_0055040_0056510 universal applicability 
ted_02724_0057010_0061620 sure if you're a business owner if you're an employee here a job seeker 
ted_02724_0062050_0063520 true if you're a man or woman 
ted_02724_0064650_0071450 i approached the eighth in atlanta the woman business owner because in my work on observe that women underpriced more so than men 
ted_02724_0072570_0075530 for gender wage gap as a well traveled narrative in this country 
ted_02724_0075820_0082530 according to the bureau of labor statistics woman employee earns just eighty three cents for every dollar manner 
ted_02724_0083150_0087470 what may surprise you that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial spirit 
ted_02724_0088280_0092490 women business owners earns just eighty cents for every dollar manner 
ted_02724_0093370_0100520 and my work i've often heard women express that they are uncomfortable communicating their value especially early on and business ownership 
ted_02724_0101980_0110510 saying things like i don't like to shoot my own horn i'd rather let them work speak for itself i don't like to think my own phrases 
ted_02724_0111600_0117900 here very different narratives and working with male business owners and i think this difference is costing women twenty cents on the dollar 
ted_02724_0119730_0124230 so i'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve the profitability 
ted_02724_0125370_0126450 companies my company 
ted_02724_0127910_0136790 after my first year in business i saw the prophet increases that my client we're realizing and working with me and i realized that i needed to reevaluate my price 
ted_02724_0137980_0140600 i was really underpriced relative value i was delivering 
ted_02724_0141720_0144290 but it's hard for me to admit to you because i'm a frightening consultant 
ted_02724_0145430_0145630 
ted_02724_0147090_0148300 what i do 
ted_02724_0148350_0149990 help companies price for value 
ted_02724_0151170_0160160 but nonetheless with what i thought and so i sat down to evaluate my pricing evaluate my value and i did that by asking key value question 
ted_02724_0161070_0163100 what are my client needs and how do i meet them 
ted_02724_0163780_0167520 where does my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my client 
ted_02724_0168720_0170030 what do i do that no one else does 
ted_02724_0171230_0192430 what problems do i fell for clients what value do i add i answered these questions and define the value that my clients get from working with me calculated their return on investment and what i saw that he didn't for double my price double it now i confess to you that this terrified 
ted_02724_0194380_0196460 to me the expert in this but i'm not here 
ted_02724_0197890_0199370 i knew the value is there 
ted_02724_0199420_0202880 i was convinced the value is there and i was still scared out of my way 
ted_02724_0204040_0205170 but if nobody would pay me that 
ted_02724_0206010_0209290 klein said that's ridiculous ridiculous 
ted_02724_0216550_0221140 was i were far from the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon 
ted_02724_0221520_0222380 from a single mom 
ted_02724_0223290_0224520 what if my business fail 
ted_02724_0225390_0226270 what if i fail 
ted_02724_0228270_0232840 but i know how to kick my own medicine the medicine that are prescribed to my client 
ted_02724_0233620_0234760 i had done the homework 
ted_02724_0235340_0236650 i knew the value was there 
ted_02724_0237690_0245910 so when prospects game are prepared the proposals with the new hire pricing and sent them out and communicated the value 
ted_02724_0247480_0248360 historian 
ted_02724_0249860_0253800 clients continued to hire me and refer me and recommend me and i'm still here 
ted_02724_0256050_0259740 and i share the story because doubts and fears are natural and normal 
ted_02724_0260450_0264750 but they don't define our value and shouldn't limit are earning potential 
ted_02724_0267580_0273290 and i'd like to share another story about a woman who learn to communicate her value and found her own voice 
ted_02724_0274980_0278530 we run the thickness for web development company employs several people 
ted_02724_0279630_0299270 when she first started her from her first several years thereafter she would say i have a little web design company she'd actually used those words with clients i have a little web design company and nathan and many other small ways she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients diminishing herself 
ted_02724_0301060_0304050 it was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth 
ted_02724_0305120_0311460 i believe her language and her style communicated that she didn't believe she had much value to offer 
ted_02724_0313810_0316330 in her own words she was practically giving her services away 
ted_02724_0318050_0324650 she began her journey to take responsibility for communicating value to clients and changing our message 
ted_02724_0326570_0333380 one thing i shared with her is that is so important to find your own voice avoidance authentic and true to you 
ted_02724_0333780_0340140 try to channel your sister in law just because she's a great salesperson or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that's not who you are 
ted_02724_0341690_0343680 this notion that it's tuning your own horn 
ted_02724_0343960_0345290 make it about the other party 
ted_02724_0345900_0349150 focus on serving and adding value and it won't feel like bragging 
ted_02724_0350460_0352360 what do you love about what you do 
ted_02724_0353070_0354910 what 's exciting about the work that you do 
ted_02724_0355220_0358500 you connect with that communicating your value will come naturally 
ted_02724_0360600_0364910 so she embraced her natural style founder voice and changed her methods 
ted_02724_0366100_0368760 for one thing she stopped calling yourself a little web design company 
ted_02724_0370120_0373440 if she really found a lot of strength and power and communicating the message 
ted_02724_0375310_0379280 now charging three times as much for web design and our business is growing 
ted_02724_0380890_0387660 if she told me about a recent meeting with a gruff and sometimes difficult client called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization 
ted_02724_0389530_0393970 in the old days that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her remind film was different 
ted_02724_0394850_0402340 she said she prepared the information sat down with the client this isn't about me it's not personal rather decline 
ted_02724_0402870_0426870 if she took them to the data through the numbers laid out the trend and the progress in our own voice and in her own way but very directly fed here's what we've done for you the client sat up and took notice and said ok and she said describing that meeting i didn't feel scared or panicky or small which is how i used to feel 
ted_02724_0427850_0433190 instead i feel like ok i got this i know what i'm doing 
ted_02724_0433910_0434590 confident 
ted_02724_0437810_0439850 being properly value is so important 
ted_02724_0440450_0448640 and you can hear in the story and the implications range far beyond just finances into the realm of self respect and self confidence 
ted_02724_0450380_0459800 but they have filled two stories one about defining our value and the other about communicating our values and neither the two elements to realizing our full earning potential 
ted_02724_0460580_0461440 the equation 
ted_02724_0462910_0486650 and if you're sitting in the audience today and you're not being paid what you're worth i'd like to welcome you into this equation just imagine what life could be like how much more we can do how much more we could get back how much more we could plan for the future of validated and respected we would feel if we could earn our full potential realize our full value 
ted_02724_0488780_0490300 no ever pay you what you're worth 
ted_02724_0491350_0494930 and only ever pay what they think your work and you control their thinking 
ted_02724_0496250_0496620 thank you 
ted_02724_0499585_0499785 
ted_02733_0013000_0021960 a few months ago my kids and i huddled around a cell phone watching a live stream of the game award one of the video game industry's biggest night 
ted_02733_0022400_0032350 they allowed to the nominees for the game for impact and award given to a thought provoking video game with a profound pro social method or meaning 
ted_02733_0032940_0037470 they opened the envelope and they read the title of our video game 
ted_02733_0037930_0040590 an award for impact 
ted_02733_0041410_0050910 with almost funny actually because i always thought that winning an award like that would have the huge impact on my life but i found that the opposite is true 
ted_02733_0051840_0056150 big night the accomplishments they fade 
ted_02733_0057000_0064570 but the hardest night of my life have stuck with me impacting who i am and what i do 
ted_02733_0065390_0071510 in two thousand and ten my third flan joel was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor 
ted_02733_0072480_0084980 and before that year with finished doctors that my husband and i down and let us know that his tumor had returned despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they can offer him 
ted_02733_0086100_0103860 that terrible night after learning that joel had perhaps four months to live i cuddled up with my two older fans in bed they were five and three at the time and i never really knew how much they understood so i started telling them a bedtime story 
ted_02733_0104400_0112930 i told them about this very brave night named joel and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer 
ted_02733_0113730_0118870 every night i called them more of the story but i never let the story and 
ted_02733_0118890_0132870 i was just building up a context that they can understand and hoping that our prayers would be answered and i would never have to tell them that night who had fought so bravely was done fighting and could rest now forever 
ted_02733_0134480_0138400 fortunately i never did have to finish that bedtime story 
ted_02733_0138990_0140940 and my children outgrew it 
ted_02733_0141140_0153220 joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment and so instead of month we spent years learning how to love are dying child with all of our hearts 
ted_02733_0154050_0164610 learning to recognize that shameful feeling of holding back just a little love to try to spare ourselves just a little pain somewhere further down the road 
ted_02733_0165760_0173140 we pushed past that self preservation because joel with worth levine even if that love can crush 
ted_02733_0174220_0181530 that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me more than any award ever could 
ted_02733_0182400_0193910 we started living like joel could live and we began developing a video game called with that dragon cancer it with the story out joel 
ted_02733_0194730_0198000 it was the story of hope in the shadow of death 
ted_02733_0198300_0209640 the story of faith and doubt and the realization that a raffle with doubt is a part of faith maybe the biggest part of it 
ted_02733_0210590_0216470 it was a story that began as a miracle and ended at the memorial 
ted_02733_0224000_0224200 
ted_02733_0224180_0234130 the 
ted_02733_0234225_0234425 
ted_02733_0255760_0268820 when you play that dragging cancer your transformed into a witness of joel life exploring an emotional landscape clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt an experienced 
ted_02733_0269240_0284770 feel the little bit like analyzing interactive poetry because every game mechanic as a metaphor and the more the player asked themselves what we as designers were trying to express and why the richer the experience become 
ted_02733_0285430_0290830 we took that vulnerability that joel paris and we encoded the game with it 
ted_02733_0291550_0300890 players expect their video games to offer them branchy narrative so that every decision that they make field important and can change the outcome of the game 
ted_02733_0301400_0313580 we subverted that principle of game design collapsing the choices in on the player so that they discover for themselves but there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for joel 
ted_02733_0314290_0329640 they feel that discovery and deeply and desperately as we felt it a night when we held joel in our arms praying for our stubbornly holding out hope for a great that we cannot create for ourselves 
ted_02733_0330990_0338070 with all prefer to win but when you discover that you can't swing what do you value instead 
ted_02733_0339630_0348520 i never plan right and video games but the moment that really changed our lives they often come as a result of our hardship and not our glory 
ted_02733_0349540_0353800 when we thought that george could live i left the game designing for my husband 
ted_02733_0353820_0358400 chime game here and there with their thien or q and some suggestions 
ted_02733_0358870_0370090 but after the night that joel died the passion the possibility of sharing jove life through our video game it was something that i couldn't resist 
ted_02733_0370320_0376900 i started writing more i sat in on our team design meetings i added more ideas and i helped direct theme 
ted_02733_0377220_0384500 i discovered that creating and video game is telling a story but with an entirely new vocabulary 
ted_02733_0384860_0394890 all the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there but they're just partnered with player agency and system responsiveness 
ted_02733_0396090_0397590 challenging work 
ted_02733_0397800_0401760 i have to think in a totally new way to do it but i love it 
ted_02733_0402480_0405080 i wouldn't have known that without joel 
ted_02733_0406450_0413560 maybe you're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game 
ted_02733_0414370_0419970 perhaps even thinking like so many people before you cancer is not a game 
ted_02733_0421300_0435990 how that any pediatric cancer parent that's ever taken and bam glove and blown it up into a balloon or transformed a syringe into a rocket ship or let their child ride their ivy pull through the hospital halls like it with a race car 
ted_02733_0436920_0440820 because when you have children everything is a game 
ted_02733_0441680_0453610 when you're young child experience and something traumatic you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game because children naturally explore their world through play 
ted_02733_0454350_0458740 cancer can feel many things from a family it shouldn't feel play 
ted_02733_0459910_0478070 if you're listening to me and you're trying to imagine this family that revamped entirely around a dying child and you can imagine enjoy as part of that picture and we were right or story with you because that feeling of our life with hard 
ted_02733_0479200_0488500 peaceably hard at times but it was also pure hope deep love and joy like i have never experienced 
ted_02733_0489760_0499840 video game with aren't attempt to share that world with people who haven't experienced it before because we never could imagine that world until it became ours 
ted_02733_0501230_0504150 we made a video game that hard to play 
ted_02733_0505340_0507130 it will never be a blockbuster 
ted_02733_0507640_0514810 people have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally in a story that pain no will break their heart 
ted_02733_0515880_0520510 but when our hearts break they heal a little differently 
ted_02733_0522020_0534780 my broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion i desired with people in their pain to hear their stories and try to help held them so that they know that their theme 
ted_02733_0536630_0559300 a night when that dragon cancer won the game for impact on word we cheered we smiled and we talked about joel and the impact she had on our life on all of those hard and hopeful night that we shared with him when he changed our hearts and how to so much more about life and love and faith and purpose 
ted_02733_0560560_0573400 fat award will never mean as much to me even single photograph of a much fun but it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted people i'll never meet 
ted_02733_0574010_0576320 they write me email from time 
ted_02733_0576890_0581770 big tell me that they miss joel even though they never met him 
ted_02733_0582350_0605540 describe the tears that they shed from my fan and it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter knowing that it shared with a ten year old watching a youtube play through or a doctor plane on his airplane with a smartphone or a professor introducing joel to her first year philosophy student 
ted_02733_0606810_0620350 we made a video game that hard to play but that feels just right for me because the hardest moments of our lives change more than any goal we could ever accomplish 
ted_02733_0621340_0626950 tragedy has shifted my heart more than any dream i could ever come true 
ted_02733_0628140_0628520 bank 
ted_02733_0628445_0628645 applause
