how_00494_0006040_0018290 the pedal board will come with velcro similar to this or if it doesn't if you have one with wood on it for example you could buy the velcro but you'd have to buy both parts 
how_00494_0019800_0023390 this you would cut the size of the backside of the pedal

how_00494_0026230_0033160 with the onto the underside of the pedal and the fabric concern here is receptive to the velcro 
how_00494_0033480_0035020 it holds a very strong bond 
how_00494_0035020_0038100 it can't even yank this off 
how_00494_0038300_0039880 and that will keep them in place 
how_00494_0040550_0050110 one problem without having a pedal board is if we had these petals all strewn across the floor during a gig they would shuffle around 
how_00494_0050110_0058370 if he kicked him they move out of place and oftentimes that could result in a plug coming out which it

how_12293_0000380_0003230 in this clip i'm going to talk a little bit about sequencing music 
how_12293_0003940_0008790 sequencing music is when you create muzak is how the technically called today 
how_12293_0008790_0012330 music that his computer generated not real instruments 
how_12293_0012860_0015540 but it can sound very close to the real thing

how_12293_0023100_0025310 what we do is take an instrument channel 
how_12293_0026000_0030180 and if you go to the eye on the ussr and you can create a motto or a stereo instruments 
how_12293_0030230_0031550 i'm going to create monterrey now

how_12293_0039890_0042970 so on this year i'm going to open amano synthesizers 
how_12293_0044140_0050950 from this here gives me the different parameters of the scent itself to change to create different types of sounds 
how_12293_0051430_0055080 when you go to channel to create a stereo drum machine 
how_12293_0055080_0058700 logic you can only have drum machine the stereo 
how_12293_0059900_0062810 and it's going to bring up the drum secrets

how_12293_0066920_0071630 start getting everything into the right tempo with the backbeat 
how_12293_0072140_0076760 then you can add other sounds such as a base or whatever the sound maybe 
how_12293_0077420_0077960 sounds 
how_12293_0077960_0083980 here i'm on the drums playing a wooden blocks 
how_12293_0085220_0093560 and the way to change between different sense is actually not by clicking on the send the soft on the channel your plan from 
how_12293_0093810_0101880 whereas now that i'm on this base thing going over my drums 
how_12293_0102390_0107420 so that's the beginning intro to creating a sequence track on logic 
how_12306_0000320_0008340 so in those twenty seven different emotional reactions that we have every hour some of them are going to be on that spectrum of anger 
how_12306_0008740_0020110 once we recognize the body symptoms again the noise of the teeth clenching of the hands one of the most important things that we can do is called changing our state 
how_12306_0020420_0022820 and that's a very very simple thing to do actually 
how_12306_0022820_0025260 a couple of key things to remember 
how_12306_0025260_0035560 one is that when emotions are coming up and we don't want to feel them regardless of which emotion it is our tendency is to hold our breath we literally stop breathing 
how_12306_0035890_0048130 and so the fastest easiest way to change your status to take a deep breath and now i don't mean i don't mean an exasperated side that's not what i mean by a deep breath 
how_12306_0048130_0077730 literally mean filling up your whole body with a full braff using all of your lungs to bring in oxygen that life giving energy and move that other energy through the body through the exhale so it's a big and literally your physical state changes and because emotions are chemicals in action in your body than your emotional state changed 
how_12306_0078200_0095270 another thing you can do is you if you're sitting down stand if you're standing up sit down if you're standing still walk movement is a great way to get energy emotion actually to go out and through the body so you can let go of whatever it is it's going on 
how_12306_0095960_0106950 these are all things that we've been talking about that you can do when your first recognizing that in fact you're annoyed frustrated angry whatever word it isn't that big spectrum called anger 
how_12306_0107690_0120850 let's take the next few segments and talk about what you can do and anger has been built up and you want to let it go so that it doesn't explode in the wrong place at the wrong time on the wrong person 
how_12313_0000080_0003960 powders can be applied with brushes or the powder puffs 
how_12313_0004320_0015510 part of has a great if you are just doing a one time application or there's a lot of concern as far as bacteria or sanitary concerns in general 
how_12313_0015740_0022120 powder puffs are disposable so that's a great way to just use them and then get rid of them 
how_12313_0023040_0025340 brushes are a little more durable 
how_12313_0025550_0030320 i really love real hair brashest when it comes to a good powder brush 
how_12313_0030540_0037280 make sure they're nice big fluffy so you can cover large areas in the phase 
how_12313_0037570_0043960 a great way to ensure the longevity of your brushes is to really frequently wash them 
how_12313_0044640_0055390 what i personally love to do is to use a mile baby shampoo and rinse your brushes with lukewarm water and with a mild babies shampoo 
how_12313_0055660_0066480 then to dry them lay them on the edge of your table so the air can circulate around the entire brush and everything will dry evenly without creating any mold 
how_12313_0066530_0069550 every use blow dryer on them 
how_12342_0031540_0032330 is not a problem 
how_12342_0034130_0040090 penn has to have one of my legs outside of her guard 
how_12342_0044020_0045350 here 's a pin 
how_12342_0045650_0049970 if i put my hand between her next even let's think this isn't still appeal 
how_12342_0050690_0054930 inside opinion 
how_12342_0055920_0057920 inside gardening 
how_12342_0060210_0061290 himself position 
how_12342_0065410_0070780 because i've got time and the other side 
how_12342_0073980_0082850 for mountain it's like this if you answered your legs to spread them out this is still a pen 
how_12342_0085070_0095320 point being as a songs you are away from her guard and not even a half guard and you are safe and not only that but you are pinning the opponent 
how_12342_0095320_0097550 and he had to make sure both shoulders are down them that 
how_12342_0097830_0108750 be sure to turn around and face completely down you might be covering your opponent but you're not pinning your opponent 
how_12346_0000080_0014440 we want to fill the milk carton up with sand which will give it some weight and that will enable us to be able to put it outside and it can stand securely so when it blows in the wind that the milk carton will not tip over 
how_12346_0014940_0024590 where we can have it stand nice and secure so the way we do that is that we try not to open up and destroy the milk carton 
how_12346_0025030_0042340 we really could open up the top and just put it right in but the milk cartons today usually come or juice cartons that usually come with a nice cap a nice space that we can use to poor things inside the way that we're going to do it as or make a little funnel out of regular cardboard paper 
how_12346_0043050_0048470 we just bend it over and begin to cut the end to give it a nice straight edge 
how_12346_0050620_0057080 we roll the ends together until it fits nicely inside the whole of the milk carton 
how_12346_0061980_0084180 and then once it is fit inside the hall and nice insecure we can go ahead and poor sand into the funnel and if the sand is a little wet might need the help of a steak her for so long object to be able to stick it inside and make space in the hall so that all the sand can run down 
how_12346_0086010_0107660 if you're going to be using wet sand it's a little bit heavier you may not need as much for your partly between two and three cups of whatever you're using whether it's sand or salt or any any other kind of value you can also use some small pebbles if they're more accessible to you 
how_12346_0109750_0115630 so we go ahead and pour the sand in this will give us a nice clean look to the window 
how_12346_0115630_0120230 we won't have to worry about closing the top of the carton will just be able to seal it shut with the cap 
how_12346_0121360_0150360 but it's also important to make sure that the carton itself as dry from the paint that we put on it because the sand if any sand drifts that drifts over or pores over the side it's going to stick to the milk carton and it's going to make the whole thing a little bit messy so just make sure that the milk carton is dry from the painted put on so that when you pour the sand in any sense tricks to the outside world actually wants to be able to be brushed off easily 
how_12346_0151520_0160960 this is the way that we fill the curtain up with sand to give it some weight so that will be able to stand nice and securely web will replace it 
how_12431_0001150_0001810 how you do 
how_12431_0001810_0002640 somebody 
how_12431_0003350_0012000 right now what i want to talk to you about is what is really good high what is good distance hostage you perform a dive in the air 
how_12431_0012280_0015260 now we've just figured out where maybe you'd like to have the fulcrum 
how_12431_0015260_0018640 if you want it forward if you want a little if you want it back 
how_12431_0018880_0019600 so that's all 
how_12431_0019600_0026600 i know a lot of you though because i've seen it when you dive end up probably fifteen twenty feet away from the board 
how_12431_0027120_0037850 well what is really good distance and competitive diving to the end of the board because if you hit the board that's not good at all but if you're too far away from the board it's also not good at all 
how_12431_0038190_0045580 so in general most judges are looking for distance that's around three feet away from the end of the board 
how_12431_0046810_0048560 i guess that's about three feet 
how_12431_0048910_0054440 so you've noticed if you're not within three feet you've got to do something a little different 
how_12431_0054640_0056840 it means you probably need more height 
how_12431_0057350_0061080 when you get more height you're actually going to bring the distance 
how_12431_0061420_0065030 usually if you don't have enough height your distance is out 
how_12431_0065230_0066280 we see how they work 
how_12431_0066280_0069740 with more height you get the closer you come into the board 
how_12431_0069840_0074170 but the less height that you get usually the farther away that you get from the board 
how_12431_0074680_0081080 good high compared to the three meter springboard behind me that would be about good height for a dive 
how_12431_0081230_0090160 anytime you do you want to make sure that you finish everything before you get to the level of the board so you've got plenty of time to enter the water and make it look nice and clean 
how_12431_0090570_0095820 how height and distance and finishing a dive is going to affect you when you try to make it down

how_12507_0102310_0106290 we can play around with these and see what they do multiple layers 
how_12507_0106690_0109390 but that's how you use layers and photo line

how_01954_0000470_0000860 
how_01954_0003570_0005320 today we're going to do an abstract painting 
how_01954_0006210_0006480 
how_01954_0006480_0007140 welcome back 
how_01954_0007640_0023050 today we're going to do an abstract painting and it took me a long time to figure out what an abstract painting was but i've found through different experiments with pain so forth that it's really an expression that you can do pretty much what any paint and color 
how_01954_0023050_0029070 it 's not so much about form it's really about expressing yourself with colors and shapes and things like that 
how_01954_0030010_0033140 this is an example of one of my abstract paintings 
how_01954_0033170_0043910 i did this a few years ago when i first moved to north carolina and i guess the colors kind of represent the ocean because we're near the ocean here and now 
how_01954_0043910_0052410 surveys show you today is a couple of different tools that you can use to make a beautiful abstract painting that would go nicely in your home 
how_01987_0000450_0023650 so when you're speaking with your taylor or maybe the rental place where you're going to be renting your suit or someone that is designing and creating something special for you one thing to consider is different next shapes that you have which are in a kind of alter the shoulder style that your government is going to be tailored in your jacket specifically 
how_01987_0024170_0039150 so if you have a short neck you're going to need a square shoulder if you have a long neck you're going to need more of a sloped shoulder and then if you just have a regular neck you're going to need just a regular shoulder 
how_01987_0039490_0055420 so there are different ways to measure that are different ways to point out or notice and take into account what type of shoulder you weren't based on your neck whatever neck you've been given 
how_01987_0055780_0057340 in all the next or find 
how_01987_0057370_0057650 cocaine 
how_01987_0057650_0074860 so most of it is going to be from here to here same as we measured our shoulders seem but i'll show it to you on paper season kind of tell the difference and decide what you are because maybe you might be living with them long neck and you just don't realize you have a long neck 
how_01987_0075320_0077630 right so let's look at the pages 
how_01987_0078440_0087840 right so here we are shoulders style normal and that is it's just like we measured before that point that goes from here to here 
how_01987_0091730_0100530 then what we have is a sloping shoulder and as you can see i showed you hear this is for a longer neck 
how_01987_0100530_0107920 came along the neck can bring your shoulders down like that and that is from here to there 
how_01987_0109440_0117640 there are under longer reading this way 
how_01987_0119020_0128150 and finally if you have a short neck and you're stuck here to see before square from here to here 
how_01987_0128330_0129000 same thing 
how_01987_0132500_0146240 so maybe these diagrams for coffee figure out whether you are a square neck or excuse me a square shoulder a sloping shoulder for there were no regular 
how_02139_0000410_0002660 so i've covered some basic movement patterns today 
how_02139_0002970_0011710 all of these have really just shown all the functional training movements that you can do and provide yourself with a good exercise program 
how_02139_0012180_0016630 please don't be swayed by what you'll see or even read often times and magazines 
how_02139_0016970_0021390 when you look around the gym and see various really improper movement patterns 
how_02139_0021610_0032640 your body the most important thing is quality of movement performing ten repetitions of of equality movement pattern will give you great results 
how_02139_0032810_0036580 no pain no gain this idea is something that is so outdated 
how_02139_0037220_0039240 it doesn't mean that you can't be sore sometimes 
how_02139_0039240_0040180 is not the idea 
how_02139_0040210_0050800 it's getting precision movement where you're focused on how the body works and how it moves and how your breathing and higher contracting the muscles are using 
how_02139_0051330_0054130 and you'll see much much better results 
how_02139_0054550_0058900 as a final thing if you have any questions always seek professional guidance 
how_02139_0059240_0068590 he was in a gym environment is very very easy to hurt yourself so it's about having fun doing things correctly and gaining in getting the results that you want 
how_02180_0000460_0003870 so here we are i've got an uphill lie now 
how_02180_0004450_0009220 it 's not side hill or downhill or anything it's just uphill it's pretty flat 
how_02180_0009250_0021960 so i normally used for the distance that i am from my target i know i normally use a six iron but because it's an uphill lie i'm going to take a five iron to hit it because you lose distance 
how_02180_0022190_0029200 so whether the clubs as well after this much but when the ground is lofted that is transferred to the club 
how_02180_0029400_0035850 so this is now more lofted shots and if it was on level on a level fairway so you want to take that into account 
how_02180_0036290_0047970 one thing you want to take into account as your weight shifting because you're on a dirt on the side of a hill you want to keep your weight more on your front so you don't fall backwards off the ball when you hit 
how_02180_0048250_0055870 so i'm just going to normally line up to the ball because there's no i'm not hooking it or i'm not dry fading 
how_02180_0056280_0065290 somebody hit the ball straight as i can and i'm going to put a little more weight on my front side and otherwise it will swing nice and easy nice normal 
how_02180_0065590_0070150 by taking that extra club i don't have to even think about muscling the ball 
how_02180_0072480_0078490 so i had a pretty solid shot there and so that's how you hit often uphill why 
how_02180_0078930_0096230 was taken extra called generally depending on the severity of the slow and just keep your balance and this way this shot won't bother yet all actually a welcome because there's different things you can do and it's a fun shot to hit 
how_02193_0002330_0005840 so are you wondering what the symptoms are the cavity 
how_02193_0005930_0014600 my name is michelle and i'm a dental assistant with solutions and i'm here to explain to you on how to determine what kind of recognize those symptoms 
how_02193_0014920_0021020 the three main symptoms really are a few have sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures 
how_02193_0021020_0037230 if you're drinking coffee and you get a little slight throbbing pain after you're done drinking or drinking very cold cold water or a cold drink and you start to get like almost shooting type pain those are symptoms on if you possibly have a cavity 
how_02193_0037550_0051510 two especially if you're eating sweets chocolates sugar any type of sugar product and you start to get a type throbbing pain and little sensitive area on your tooth that is a symptom of a cavity 
how_02193_0051770_0070000 and to whenever you're writing down in your chewing food if once when you write down and you kind of felt like a little as electric kind of shock pain and then you release and it turns to almost a throbbing where you feel like your heartbeat is in your tooth those are all symptoms of to determine on if you have a cavity 
how_02193_0070000_0082670 so basically you need to if you're having these symptoms you would need to go see your general dennis so therefore he can do a thorough exam and see if it is a true cavity or if it was just like a fluke thing 
how_02193_0082670_0084690 so once again raise michelle 
how_02193_0084720_0089540 dental assistant with solutions and aren't just explain to you on how you can determine if you have a cavity 
how_02216_0001380_0004700 but i'm going to show you how to make is this wonderful bang 
how_02216_0005140_0010500 we haven't attached the handles yet because i want to show you how to do that we're going to make different handles for different banks 
how_02216_0011370_0032510 is a very simple pattern with some of you may recognize the middle is a pattern called a granny square and there's granny square is repeated in different colors different combinations of the colors in nine all around the side a row of three nine another of three and another row three 
how_02216_0032510_0043300 given stephen these number combinations that are simple makes it easier on you as the pattern continues because you must remember these numbers to make it all work out the same 
how_02216_0043850_0051380 for this pattern because we're using the granny square as our base you can add as many rows and columns as you want making his vision like 
how_02216_0051970_0060620 this is also great for making something like a blanket or anything else where you can just use patchwork and so it together to make a big piece quake 
how_02216_0061200_0067800 is really easy pattern it does take a bit of time but as you can see it looks great when it's done 
how_02294_0000100_0005180 named terry and then this segment we're going to talk about how to prevent oily skin 
how_02294_0005620_0024150 some of us just have naturally more oily skin than others and actually although it can be annoying at times it's actually a blessing in disguise because the oil air your skin is that just means the more moisture there isn't it and that will prevent you from aging prematurely 
how_02294_0024360_0029860 so if you have oily skin and you get frustrated with it just remember it's a good thing 
how_02294_0031090_0036120 and now of course one of the most basic things you can do after you wash your face is to use a proper toner 
how_02294_0037250_0043470 now want to stay away if you ever oily skin you actually want to stay away from alcohol based donors 
how_02294_0043980_0046970 if anyone especially stay away from rubbing alcohol 
how_02294_0047000_0049220 some people think that works like a toner 
how_02294_0050060_0066260 what that actually does it dries out your skin to the point that your skin has to further make more moisture or more oil and it actually produces an oil your face then than drying out your skin 
how_02294_0067720_0075480 so you want to start off with using that after you wash and then throughout the day if you find yourself getting a little oily you can use powder 
how_02294_0075660_0079750 the compact little bit of powder 
how_02294_0080990_0101240 we can use one with a sponge that will absorb some of the oil as well or one with a brush or there's these great blotting tissues that you can purchase and they will keep the makeup on your face if you're wearing any but it will just remove the oil and dirt 
how_02294_0102250_0103760 so it's a quick fix 
how_02294_0103970_0112680 it 's a lot it on the areas where your skin might be a little oily and that's how you prevent oily skin 
how_02305_0000100_0001920 right we're ready to start our fire 
how_02305_0002400_0011120 when i always like to have nearby is my blower just in case it needs a little bit of extra oxygen and air to get to get moving 
how_02305_0011510_0016230 i don't think it's going to be an issue today because we've got a nice little bit of wind coming at us 
how_02305_0016600_0022040 and that's that speaks to the next point of which areas should delight first 
how_02305_0022040_0025560 well you should light all around the fire two three four spots if he can 
how_02305_0025950_0034660 but what we want to do is we want to light where the winds coming from because that's going to give us a better chance of getting it catching fire catching all of an unfair 
how_02305_0034660_0037100 maybe we won't have delighted in different spots around 
how_02305_0037330_0040890 will actually be able to tell once you actually get it in there you can get it lives 
how_02305_0040890_0044160 so i'm going to go ahead and dip down here and hopefully you can see this 
how_02305_0044160_0048880 and i'm just going to light it it might take a couple of times to get the lighter going 
how_02305_0048880_0055200 but you can see you can see insert these a lot further rather than having a handheld later and trying to get your hand in there 
how_02305_0055530_0057460 where even using matches and throwing them 
how_02305_0057460_0058490 and these tend to work better 
how_02305_0058620_0061050 go ahead and see if it's not too late 
how_02305_0061580_0062990 because i could get a poem in there 
how_02305_0065240_0066430 it looks like it's catching 
how_02305_0066430_0070610 definitely see smoke and where there's smoke there's fire

how_02659_0011410_0015330 first thing i'm going to do is open my feet into a second position 
how_02659_0015840_0018210 so i'm just going to take my feet a little bit wide 
how_02659_0018210_0028400 i'm going to have them turned out a little bit so if i bend my knees they would go right over my toes but they're turned out there not parallel they're turned out comfortably 
how_02659_0029200_0035460 i'm going to reach up with my arms so that i haven't the in my arms that's very symmetrical to the in my legs 
how_02659_0036020_0044250 i'm going to push my feet into the ground i'm going to push my shoulders into my back and then i'm going to reach up and over with my upper body 
how_02659_0044250_0050410 i 'm going to keep my head active so it is not hanging its active 
how_02659_0050700_0055770 my neck as long my chin is dropped back a little bit and i'm reaching up 
how_02659_0056250_0061040 so i feel really deep intense stretch in this whole side of my body 
how_02659_0062050_0063700 i'm going to take deep breaths well i'm there 
how_02659_0063700_0068990 and i'm going to make sure not to collapse in the side of my body 
how_02659_0068990_0072210 ritchie and reaching for the corner of the wall 
how_02659_0073410_0080290 and then i'm going to push through my foot to bring my upper body back to center and i can go up and over the other way 
how_02659_0082800_0084430 reaching out out out 
how_02659_0085570_0089250 coming up and over back to neutral 
how_02659_0089530_0092760 so that's a great way to get some lateral stretches in modern dance 
how_02659_0092760_0096390 so you can take your time with those stretches as much time as you want 
how_02659_0096390_0099110 when a little bit quickly but you take your time 
how_02659_0099710_0100030 
how_02739_0000060_0000640 
how_02739_0006680_0027940 for about one you have a totally blind handoff where the receiver of the baton is not looking at the baton or the person sending the baton so that can be completely burned where they're running and to reach back and wait to feel the button next to be half blind which is used in the mile really by some third world countries teams that have more chemistry and that requires much practice 
how_02739_0027940_0035290 and what they're going to do is they start blind by taking three steps turn back reach grab the baton and continue running 
how_02739_0035830_0045300 and then there was the one demonstrated by deron where it was the entire time he was back looking at the baton reach back and that's completely safe although it is the slowest hand off 
how_02739_0046540_0056150 in a mile relay you're coming in and your finishing last twenty five meters so you're going to have even to be lactate threshold where your muscles aren't doing acting like they were at the beginning of the race 
how_02739_0056150_0064870 when you come here you're going to really need the recipient to help you out and gauge how far you are and that was zero percent blind handoff he looked 
how_02739_0064870_0069540 back and reach for it and took it and there was no mistaking where the baton is at anytime 
how_02788_0000540_0000960 
how_02788_0000960_0001810 a light year 
how_02788_0007890_0013770 we just started talking a little bit about touch and becoming familiar with your own instrument 
how_02788_0014590_0035060 but in general anytime you're playing any steel pans whether it's this one on one of my many other instruments you have to learn that the lower notes as i mentioned before you have to play softly on up to the higher notes which you have to play harder in order to get the same volume 
how_02788_0035440_0041250 i'm going to demonstrate again playing this note with the same intensity that i would play this 
how_02788_0041540_0043130 in other words i'm going to play the softly 
how_02788_0044690_0045980 not going to get much out of it 
how_02788_0046550_0054200 if i played this note this larger note with that same intensity i get a lot more out of it 
how_02788_0054590_0056230 which you have to become familiar with 
how_02788_0056640_0062400 the way become familiar with that is actually just play your instrument and listening just like anything 
how_02788_0062720_0066030 lowest no on this particular instrument is over here 
how_02788_0066030_0088720 i'm going to play now and kind of use the whole drum and i'm going to try to be aware of how the intensity changes as i moved from the low notes to that the 
how_02788_0088720_0113950 the you get a little bit an idea about when i was hitting those high notes had to strike those a little bit harder 
how_02788_0114320_0117610 when you get to those low notes you've got to be really gentle on them 
how_02788_0118110_0121400 there are also musical choices that you will make 
how_02788_0121430_0123950 sometimes you want to get those lower notes a little harder 
how_02788_0124100_0126830 sometimes you want to get those little software to be softer 
how_02788_0127120_0128460 a musical choices 
how_02788_0128680_0134240 learning the intensity that's necessary for each note on your instrument very important 
how_02870_0000170_0002800 the split we're going to learn how to reduce fractions 
how_02870_0002800_0009900 the easiest way to reduce a fraction for example let's say you have to over eight ok 
how_02870_0010750_0015140 these are even numbers pick a number that goes into both divide 
how_02870_0015140_0019820 to divide by two and yet one over four feet 
how_02870_0019820_0021770 with reduced the fraction 
how_02870_0021770_0024230 so you have three overnight then 
how_02870_0024350_0029320 divide by three divide by three and you get one over three may 
how_02870_0029320_0034330 ensure that the number you divide the top and the bottom by is the same number 
how_02870_0034400_0038040 cannot use of different number here and a different number there 
how_02870_0038040_0042000 learn how to reduce a large fraction such as within the other clint 
how_02870_0042000_0045950 we have two thousand divided by eight thousand well 
how_02870_0046650_0048950 match cereals and casual whatever 
how_02870_0048950_0050960 cancer tapi cancel a bomb 
how_02870_0050960_0053200 we have to have the same number of zeros 
how_02870_0053200_0057320 bafflement to over eight this is not fully reduce shit 
how_02870_0057350_0064940 by to divide by to cause and you'll get one over four songs 
how_02870_0064940_0069290 in two thousand over eight thousand is the same exact thing as one over four 
how_02870_0069290_0071680 was reduced fractured to lowest turns always 
how_02907_0010510_0017810 another way to lose game of a ball is if the eight ball falls off the table lens on the floor 
how_02907_0018660_0026090 if any other object bowling falls on the floor has responded budget for the eight ball burns up on the floor it's considered the last game 
how_02907_0027390_0040280 if you're shooting at the eight ball and you make it in their own pocket you designate a certain pocket for the apple fall where a ball doesn't get to that pocket but inadvertently falls into a different pocket that will be considered last game 
how_02907_0041600_0060750 a third way to lose his game is if you're shooting at the eight ball you make the ball but during your stroke you committed fall than that people committed to fall during the x during the execution of making them making the eight ball that would be considered lasik game 
how_03044_0024000_0042650 three green onions you can also use one red onion instead of three green onions the red onion goes very nicely also eight ounces of federer cheese one cup of greek olives and two pounds of cherry tomatoes 
how_03044_0042960_0049930 these are nice and fresh cherry tomato see that the greens are still not dry down there nice and fresh 
how_03044_0050360_0060660 look for good tasting tomatoes since it is such a major part of a greek salad k will clean up our vegetables and get started 
how_03099_0000870_0008360 now already to seal off the bottom of our bag and we're gonna do one on the inside and repeat the process on the outside as well 
how_03099_0008550_0012890 inside you can just use a patch but for the outside we're going to use this really pretty 
how_03099_0013280_0018370 except that my shirt right side in and put my hands and it toward savant so i can allow sit out 
how_03099_0018990_0023460 lay down on a hard surface like an ironing board or a cutting board

how_03099_0032680_0034770 you're going to have to iron and on for a while 
how_03099_0034770_0037310 it 's going to take about thirty seconds per section 
how_03099_0037660_0042420 when i started to a cotton setting and you just want to start working the apple 
how_03099_0042420_0050080 on their air got an iron that on and that's going to bind to the fabric and then that's going to seal the bottom of your 
how_03099_0051100_0054390 whatever parts you don't use you've just got a cutaway that access 
how_03099_0055510_0057960 so we're going to keep smoothness on 
how_03099_0058100_0061150 and again it's going to take about thirty seconds perception 
how_03099_0061150_0066110 and you know it's on good when you start to pull it away and all you get back as the paper 
how_03099_0067910_0075950 i want to keep going over every section that i want to apply 
how_03099_0075950_0078720 playing the whole thing so i want to get the edges really 
how_03099_0078720_0082510 he can't be too generous with the 
how_03099_0082510_0088190 it can even give it up last the steep angles start to notice a moisture pattern on the back of the paper 
how_03099_0088430_0090080 so that's how you know it's getting to be done 
how_03099_0090080_0094260 so it's starting to pull that moisture thrill 
how_03175_0000090_0007120 one of the last but often overlooked steps to cleaning your brushes and a whole lot of other artists implements is shaping 
how_03175_0007770_0014240 by shaping i mean making sure the brush he's going to dry and relatively similar shape to how it was beforehand 
how_03175_0014420_0018140 so if you have like a square shape here at the top therefore it's going to dry that way 
how_03175_0018400_0022090 so what can happen is over time you can see this guy's connoisseurship 
how_03175_0022090_0029740 we used to be tampering to the end there and now it's kind of off fuzzy and weird and more like a flat toppling he got a buzz cut down the barbershop 
how_03175_0030530_0034070 this can be prevented by making sure you take some very easy steps for shaping 
how_03175_0034410_0052220 there are also some oils and liquids and post cleaning products you can get the shape this but the basic the signs of it if you will if it is even as a science is what i do is take a paper towel one of the best still wet and i'm just clean it kind of run through the brush and i'll try and shape it 
how_03175_0053020_0063570 oftentimes brushes will spread outwards so basically kind of shaping it and kind of pressing it in a little bit will help keep its shape more and when it dries 
how_03175_0063890_0066480 paper towels are very helpful in this regard 
how_03175_0070570_0074330 because if you do not do this you're basically brushes life will be into 
how_03175_0074760_0084010 other things you can do to keep shape is like if you have some random bristles you can always senior with a little pair of tweezers or clippers that those guys off to help your brush keep its shape

how_03858_0023570_0026100 very common as the scariest doctor 
how_03858_0027520_0028790 ok my friend 
how_03858_0028820_0032390 we get it out of the case

how_03858_0033120_0035500 case what happened to adopt the shores 
how_03858_0035790_0037210 for instance you 
how_03858_0037350_0039800 i hope it's not serious 
how_03858_0039830_0043770 notes that seriously certainly true that the other doctors 
how_03858_0043930_0045420 as long as you move 
how_03858_0045420_0050250 we see this here this is what i'm going to be using the edge 
how_03858_0050460_0051360 top vietnam 
how_03858_0051980_0054660 actually for small will get the bigger one 
how_03858_0054690_0061240 this one we usually saved for elephants for the new york is let me say this 
how_03858_0061720_0062100 work 
how_03908_0035360_0038620 we might be able to for example to have fun backgrounds 
how_03908_0039290_0042350 not being able to attach interesting zones to 
how_03908_0043250_0046080 and of course you should always be able to upgrade the camera 
how_03908_0046080_0047560 so start with a cheap camera 
how_03908_0047880_0049600 and then you can always upgrade later 
how_03908_0050900_0053590 ability is also a big feature for kids 
how_03908_0053820_0059650 so go online check reviews and choose a camera which is going to stand up to some hard use 
how_03908_0060670_0065310 at the beginning of course is probably best to choose a very simple point and shoot camera 
how_03908_0065610_0072570 cleverly in her own you can always upgrade to a camera which has facilities such as an optical or digital zoom 
how_03908_0072960_0074800 it should have anti red eye facility 
how_03908_0075240_0079280 and perhaps has got a built in macro attachment on 
how_03908_0079280_0083390 if you really have the money he might even be able to afford image stabilisation 
how_03908_0084490_0088080 lastly don't worry too much about mega pixels 
how_03908_0088430_0090680 to find a camera that's easier to use 
how_03908_0090680_0093340 easier it is to use the better your child will like it 
how_03908_0093800_0096850 and remember lastly don't buy a camera that you like 
how_03908_0097030_0098160 they 're probably hate 
how_03933_0000170_0002650 i use drums all from one kid 
how_03933_0002650_0028270 i like to mix and match sounds in trying to defend machines and logged but within here you can do is we can try to separate are sounds by the actual instruments so that we can have flexibility in the way we play in the way that it's repeated so we do is we were actually just child is this the scenario quake was going at it and then i'll show you how to way or another attribute over it 
how_03933_0029960_0047620 right now this is being played where i can do with actually changes noise and they won't do it on and mode thing with the same setting is change it up 
how_03933_0048020_0060170 on tourism and go to my next check bring up that art should be allowed to kick now 
how_03971_0000050_0001190 well we're almost done 
how_03971_0001220_0005820 the last thing we're gonna do above the nose is the eyebrows 
how_03971_0006220_0009160 and that's very important for any makeup luck 
how_03971_0009330_0016860 the era of shape your face and they certainly shape your eyes so you always want to make sure you just fill in your eyebrows 
how_03971_0016860_0030350 forget your take care of your eyebrows her eyebrows are nice and fall they're just not as dark as her hair so arm and since this look is pretty natural i'm just going to fill them in a little bit with the natural brown that matches her hair color 
how_03971_0031470_0032850 amusing and angled brush 
how_03971_0033440_0036230 a little bit goes a long way when it comes to eyebrow color 
how_03971_0037120_0039320 that 's why you never want to use a black or anything like that 
how_03971_0039320_0041950 he 's a pretty neutral color that matches your hair color 
how_03971_0042800_0044730 and i'm just filling in her natural arch 
how_03971_0045140_0049050 if she had her eyebrows waxed are plucked beforehand so they're in a nice natural are 
how_03971_0049050_0054570 we're just going to fill them in because they give them a little colour and shape 
how_03971_0060370_0070900 and after a color the man you like them stick lowbrow brush her brow poem just camo through just to get the excess powder out 
how_03971_0074960_0076220 and give him a nice little shape 
how_03971_0076870_0079310 of the tremendous difference between the two eyebrows 
how_03971_0080320_0084490 i mean this when shapes her eye and shapes her face and this looks unfinished 
how_04104_0000540_0000740 applause 
how_04104_0006860_0010850 and now we're going to talk about the ingredients for a need for a garlic tomato bruschetta 
how_04104_0011570_0042450 we need one quarter cup olive oil three tablespoons chopped fresh basil need one quarter cup finely chopped green onions three to four garlic cloves minced half a teaspoon salt quarter teaspoon pepper for medium tomatoes diced two tablespoons graded parmesan one third cup reduced fat margin and one loaf which is around roughly one pound on sliced french bread 
how_04104_0043330_0051600 in traditional factual this is two pieces will equal one hundred and fifty six calories six grams of fat and one gram of saturated fat 
how_04190_0000140_0004910 in this clip on board that demonstrate some attacks and he's going to defend and cut 
how_04190_0005460_0006930 attacks defend and cut 
how_04190_0007570_0011240 and now they're going to be thrusting attacks because you can score with the point 
how_04190_0012160_0013460 so let's start that 
how_04190_0015150_0021450 standing their own garden the position all what does it bob three gave me two thousand and two 
how_04190_0022300_0023530 ok he's in three 
how_04190_0023530_0025330 so i'm going to make a thrusting attacks 
how_04190_0026180_0027510 actually what he said 
how_04190_0027510_0028760 is trying to go through my voice 
how_04190_0028760_0029690 go through my voice 
how_04190_0029690_0034250 we've got to get overly cut the arm is available 
how_04190_0034250_0037680 god 's guarding a promo for the arms available 
how_04190_0037680_0038770 right now 
how_04190_0038770_0040520 you have to do 
how_04190_0040520_0045540 by blade just a little bit and the referee will consider it a parrot 
how_04190_0045540_0049640 i'm going again 
how_04190_0049640_0052520 got a little already 
how_04190_0052520_0054290 ok 
how_04190_0054290_0055840 with the on the head 
how_04190_0056540_0056850 
how_04190_0056850_0057150 because 
how_04190_0058700_0062300 give me another carry on 
how_04190_0062300_0063870 another one like this 
how_04190_0065040_0067260 
how_04190_0067380_0068180 fear 
how_04190_0069660_0070650 ok 
how_04190_0070700_0078140 right so you have to clear ablaze and that takes our practice usually 
how_04190_0078140_0085080 perry you clearly blade by doing a helicopter action and then making the cut helicopter arrived 
how_04190_0085080_0091820 after the ferry and then the cod go again 
how_04190_0096930_0097680 important 
how_04190_0099530_0099840 
how_04190_0099840_0100200 
how_04190_0100200_0101400 too hard you try 
how_04190_0101400_0104780 hard it's going to be difficult take 
how_04190_0104780_0106420 from time to its slow 
how_04285_0000350_0017870 sometimes depending on the type of stone and type a vessel that we're using you can actually use a burnished punch setting punch like these whichever the cup shaped interior are nice and smooth and you'll put it over the bezel and use a hammer to set the stone 
how_04285_0018420_0034400 works well with smaller faceted stones and in situations where you're going to need to set a lot of vessels that stones but it definitely doesn't give you the really delicate feel that you have by hand setting it and it definitely doesn't work for irregularly shaped stone 
how_04285_0035100_0087750 one of the other important things that you need to remember when using these is to make sure that your bezel space around them for the edge of the burnished punch to actually slide around when you hit it then probably the last most important thing is to make sure that you're setting is somewhere that's extremely solid because otherwise every time you hit it it's just going to bounce so it's important especially when using these to also make sure that your stone is perfectly cited in the setting because once you hit it chances are it will stay right where you put it so you want to use and nice from hit with a hammer such as a chasing hammer like this one and preferably if you're setting can be sitting on a metal surface or very firmly locked in a heavy vice you'll get the best results 
how_04647_0000810_0008000 what we're going to discuss and go over its proper technique on how to inspect firefighters bunker pants or turn up pants 
how_04647_0009230_0015540 one of the first things we want to do is visually inspect the material for any rips your tears are weak spots 
how_04647_0016560_0028810 chemicals and ultraviolet light can damage the turnout clothing so by gently pulling and tugging at the same time visually inspecting the stitching to make sure nothing has come loose and there is no physical damage 
how_04647_0028950_0033940 if we find any the gear should be sent out for repair or replacement should take place 
how_04647_0034380_0039750 checking the knee pad area for any holes loose shredding that may have to be repaired 
how_04647_0040720_0048170 beyond that we will check any hardware like zippers or any clips or fasteners to make sure they are all and good working order 
how_04647_0049320_0058360 sippers snaps and then move on to the inner liner including the snaps that hold in the thermal barrier and the moisture barrier 
how_04647_0059640_0075880 one way that we could check that moisture a thermal barrier is to hold it up to light and try to see through it or place and over something like a five gallon pale and pour water on to it to see if water will repel or not go through that thermal barrel barrier which tells us and still intact and in good shape 
how_04647_0076550_0083470 well considered the suspenders part of the gear they should also be inspected to make sure their tight and improper working order 
how_04807_0002690_0007290 so in this clip we're going to go ahead and make a pattern for our eye mask 
how_04807_0008330_0012880 we already have an eye mask it's just a plain kind of boring when that i bought it a mass mark 
how_04807_0012910_0024960 pet store so i'm just going to use this as a template but if you don't have a sleeping mass basically you want something that's an oval shape about i'd say this is about six inches wide 
how_04807_0025680_0032530 we want to place cut out for your news so you basically make like along oval and then we're going to skip out of place 
how_04807_0032560_0041130 with the news so i'm just going to bring this to my paper and then i'm going to go ahead and chase it 
how_04807_0043430_0051350 we just go ahead and trace it can lift up the little nose guard part come back down 
how_04807_0054270_0057530 doesn't have to be exact because we're going to clean it up when we cut it out 
how_04807_0061480_0067570 i actually want mind to come down a little further so i'm just going to go ahead and freehand 
how_04807_0068500_0087110 and what you do when you're actually free handing something is you go ahead and just folded in half and then we'll cut it out so that the other side is sexy 
how_04807_0088220_0098010 and i remember when you are making patterns or cutting out patterns to have a separate scissors that you can use just for paper 
how_04807_0098210_0100710 as you don't want to use a really good fabric scissors 
how_04807_0114850_0125880 go ahead and see this as a little bit too straight so we just couldn't go ahead and clean that line up just a little can make it a little more just visual leo 
how_04807_0131720_0137570 once you have your paper pattern they were ready to transfer this onto her fabric and actually cut it out 
how_04927_0001370_0004380 segment we're going to talk about reflecting telescopes 
how_04927_0004800_0013990 and our refractors first appeared on the scene in the early sixteen hundreds as astronomy progressed it became obvious that larger lenses were going to be needed to see those more distant objects 
how_04927_0014330_0018310 problem was that larger glass was expensive and difficult to manufacture 
how_04927_0018680_0026500 it was solved a little bit later when a guy named isaac newton invented a telescope with a concave mirror as opposed to a convex glass 
how_04927_0026780_0031950 and here's where it cheaper less expensive to manufacture and you can make them and larger sizes 
how_04927_0032200_0039060 so newtonian telescopes and hence the name are typically a little bit more cost effective for the light gathering ability 
how_04927_0039260_0042690 will discuss the different type amounts here in just a moment 
how_04927_0043420_0057690 one of the things you should know about a reflecting telescope is that the light comes in through the shield right here and bounces off a mirror backup into a secondary mirror up near the eyepiece that actually throws the light into the piece allowing you to view 
how_04927_0058760_0066940 larger aperture telescopes such as as tenants right here can still be broken down rather quickly and easily and compact 
how_04927_0066940_0070370 you can throw in the back of a small car and take out to a dark sky observing site 
how_04927_0070920_0075390 starting with six to eight inches these are ideal for getting started with deep sky objects 
how_04927_0075390_0083840 you starting a messy a list you want to see the more distant globular clusters are supernovas these are really the most cost effective way to get aperture 
how_04927_0084140_0085950 we 're only for astronomy however 
how_04927_0085950_0088050 we cannot use the scopes for daytime use 
how_04927_0088310_0092450 if everything would be upside down and backwards have been disorientating to try to use 
how_04938_0000940_0006190 next thing you need to know some of the tolzien you'll be used for when you're making your rates 
how_04938_0007020_0011760 we use a wire cutter or the wire flowers that we're going to be using 
how_04938_0012070_0023340 a needle nose pliers if you need to get in there and tighten up anything on to the race heavier gauge cutters for the thicker flowers 
how_04938_0024490_0032590 you can get a non wrapped the floral tape gauge wire that you can buy it any craft store 
how_04938_0033440_0045840 i also like to use oasis paper wrapped wire if you are using this make sure you pull it from the center so you can continue using it is not creates a big message you pull it out at the top 
how_04938_0047530_0058140 whatever you prefer whether it be a glue gun with glue sticks or you can use a looming glue or some kind of floral glue 
how_04938_0058140_0060060 can you could buy a hardware store 
how_04938_0060760_0066840 i also like to make sure i have my old paintbrush around so that if i have any strings or anything to pull off 
how_04938_0067420_0077140 a good pair of scissors are always half full from whenever you're cutting the bows as well as the different types of ruins you may want to use for and you're making your race 
how_04938_0078430_0081700 these are the tools you need in order to make theories 
how_04960_0000600_0008430 in the rocky level i showed a quarter gassy how to turn out of it just like this grabbing the wrist stepping out and putting the person and corrugated 
how_04960_0008430_0012760 i'm going to show you a little bit different version that's going to connect with the things that we're going to do here and a little bit 
how_04960_0013050_0014040 from stand behind me right here 
how_04960_0014800_0018690 instead of doing that now i'm going to come out just like this 
how_04960_0019730_0023590 just like i back out to the side that's the foetus forwards 
how_04960_0023590_0026890 for my foot as forward here i stepped back that's all i do 
how_04960_0027230_0028480 one too 
how_04960_0028760_0030520 if your partner resist you grab tight 
how_04960_0031190_0034410 and you'll find that they can get out they can't stop you from moving 
how_04960_0034780_0038010 once i do this technique here i'm out of harm's way 
how_04960_0038210_0040290 what i get to do is really up to me 
how_04960_0040710_0044700 his hand up here is going to swoop down and grab the sadder risks 
how_04960_0045140_0046210 and to do that a little bit slower 
how_04960_0048220_0054200 here it's going to come in here and grab this risk as a ten call and as i turn just like here 
how_04960_0054420_0057490 from there it looks a lot like milanesi quarter gassy 
how_04960_0057600_0059870 
how_04960_0059910_0066490 one two three 
how_04960_0066490_0067440 
how_04960_0067610_0087430 from here just like that 
how_04960_0090150_0096270 blend with this come up underneath and turn him just like that are slow this down a little bit 
how_04960_0096350_0104060 he comes blend with the attack hand comes up here spin around quarter gash 
how_04960_0105250_0118830 sometimes abbreviate coda guess you've got a gash here 
how_04960_0118830_0119120 applause 
how_04960_0119700_0127010 one more time 
how_05041_0000540_0004370 in this clip about performance art i'm going to talk about finding a venue 
how_05041_0004680_0007350 so you've created your performance art piece 
how_05041_0007350_0008550 it has a concept 
how_05041_0008900_0013540 we use the senses its visual has no costumes what have you 
how_05041_0013850_0015370 workshopped it 
how_05041_0015630_0016780 what do you got grants 
how_05041_0016780_0018400 it got a free piano the deal 
how_05041_0018460_0020040 when you're going to perform it now 
how_05041_0020330_0022090 well you could find a venue 
how_05041_0022090_0024370 irregular venue at a concert 
how_05041_0024710_0026950 hall a restaurant a club 
how_05041_0027240_0029280 you could produce your own event 
how_05041_0029280_0031440 we could do a night of performance artists 
how_05041_0031700_0035280 other performers artists to share your gig 
how_05041_0035410_0036910 so that you have more of a draw 
how_05041_0036940_0039540 you could look into performance art festival 
how_05041_0039540_0040590 on the computer 
how_05041_0040910_0042530 can discern research and the internet 
how_05041_0042820_0046060 and find proof festivals to submit your work too 
how_05041_0046250_0047960 you could perform at a fundraiser 
how_05041_0047990_0051580 fundraisers are always looking for free performers

how_05541_0006560_0016820 in this clip i'll be discussing the the importance of understanding how to live in a dorm ipod or a room setting in the prison system 
how_05541_0016930_0024290 a lot of people have a miss concept about it they think that people are sitting on cots behind bars and quite usually that's not the case 
how_05541_0024290_0035880 the county jail basically houses people in the forms of pods where they have several different rooms and side of the pods and you're living in a space that's extremely small without any storage 
how_05541_0036470_0055950 once you get to the state institution level where the previously center level you may find yourself in a dorm style setting with rows upon rows of steel bunk beds and the only space that is actually yours is that that exists between the two your bed and the bed next to you and a lockbox that slides underneath the bottom bunk 
how_05541_0055950_0060980 bad luck boxes usually about two and a half by one and a half feet and it's about a foot deep

how_05541_0069230_0076200 once you get to the pre release level you may be fortunate enough to stay in a room with only four or three other people for room for man room total 
how_05541_0076580_0083300 under those circumstances you begin to realize that there are certain things you have to do in order to be comfortable and healthy as well 
how_05541_0083710_0099000 cleanliness is an extra godliness and the prison system because you don't have a lot of space and because there was a lot of confinement you can find yourself subjects different infections and diseases illnesses that you may not necessarily come across so readily if you are out walking around in the streets every day

how_05739_0040590_0041510 one too 
how_05780_0000330_0004060 so here we are on the other side of the room and it's just getting so exciting 
how_05780_0004060_0006020 we have to wrap this up in the next couple of days 
how_05780_0006250_0017000 tamara closet gets install we have my idea about the door still to execute with cutting it in half creating kind of a farmhouse store you'd think would be really cute if we can pull it off 
how_05780_0017580_0026310 steps i'm going to leave in concrete we're going to clean them up and we're going to seal them and i think that would lend to that lofty kind of den like feeling 
how_05780_0026650_0028490 you can see cypriot framed this 
how_05780_0028520_0031090 we bumped out for the electrical box 
how_05780_0031350_0039940 barcodes that we want to really be careful about not that i know them all but one for sure is that we maintain clear access to the electrical panel 
how_05780_0040220_0049150 is the in the event of a fire or emergency situation where you have to flip your breakers you have a clear he grass to the box 
how_05780_0049150_0073370 so we've created that here will have a door on this so that conceals in our switches are right here come around to our new little bay window which when things happen they don't go the way you plan like we had planned to bump this whole thing out two feet so now we've lost the actual floor two feet of it but i'm really excited because now we're going to be able to put patrick's desk here we're going to build this desk and for him 
how_05780_0073670_0091020 and to say cost effective with it this will just get a piece of plywood over it and then i'm having the glasgow when he comes in measures for these little insert sidelight sometimes windows are called side lights or lights so that i could deceiving little technical term that threw me early on 
how_05780_0091880_0099150 is going to have a nice glass top table and will extend it out ten inches so that his chair will fit under it and this will become his death 
how_05780_0099910_0102420 choosing to do this and glass for two reasons 
how_05780_0103600_0109370 first is i love that glass you can see right through it and it keeps the space expansive 
how_05780_0109850_0116250 if you've got a small living room and a coffee table you put a big dark chunky coffee table in their rooms going to feel small 
how_05780_0116470_0120540 if you put a lighter weight base and a glass top that room will stay more areas 
how_05780_0120760_0126980 classes really good and in small spaces where we're looking to not you know we don't want to jam with furnishings 
how_05780_0127270_0132410 so his desk chair will sit nicely in front of this will be a dance can be able to have all this light while he was working 
how_05780_0132860_0138260 we should even appear to put a printer or any other little electronics that everyone seems to have these days 
how_05780_0139060_0144290 and i think that it will be real easy to will pull our wires to wear earplugs over there and it will be good to go 
how_05780_0144900_0146800 we should see a lot of progress by the end of the week 
how_05814_0002050_0007200 both financing is something that we do offer as a dealership in marine industry 
how_05814_0007630_0011170 is something you want to look into if you start looking for a cash purchase 
how_05814_0012300_0017390 typically the loans anywhere from twenty five to fifty thousand dollars finance are going to offer you a fifteen year loan 
how_05814_0017770_0021310 if you go from fifty to one hundred thousand hours off each one year alone 
how_05814_0021650_0026150 if you go up from two hundred to three hundred thousand hours on earth they went off your third year 
how_05814_0026150_0031350 if you go down from twenty five thousand dollars you gonna find anywhere from eight to twelve year alone 
how_05814_0031590_0036100 the higher volume and price range you finance a longer term you're going to be able to go 
how_05814_0036660_0059250 interest rates on a bow is definitely going to be a little higher than a car or a house in the reasons why that is because anytime you have something that you don't need are necessary like an automobile his ethnicity houses nasty rv a motorcycle their rates are little higher because it's something that you don't need every day 
how_05814_0059570_0066450 typically with good credit nowadays we're finding customers getting you are from seven and a half to eight percent rate on financing 
how_05910_0000810_0003840 today we're going to show how to hold a stick properly 
how_05910_0004740_0037490 before even holding the stick you have to realize that there are many different kinds of sticks out there but some of the more common kinds are a traditional wooden stick and aluminum shaft this one happens to have separate blade so it's a two piece stick the one i'm using right now is a one piece graphite stick 
how_05910_0039970_0045490 more of a personal preference but with today's technology a lot of people who have been using the graphite one piece sticks 
how_05910_0046760_0052650 first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you get to the right level the right length of the stick 
how_05910_0053050_0060380 so most common is when you're on your skates the top of the stick should be about at your chin 
how_05910_0060410_0064320 if you're standing on your feet it should be about your nose 
how_05910_0067540_0071030 and that's that's how you pretty much get an average length 
how_05910_0071410_0086010 also depending on what position you play if you're a forward they tend to have the stick length a little bit shorter whereas defenseman tend to have their state quake a little bit longer but like i said it's more of a personal preference 
how_06085_0000390_0006310 in this segment we're going to talk about some basic foot brushes and how to do passes with a foot brush 
how_06085_0007260_0028860 before we talked about how to do a foot brush back to yourself and the basic food brush can also be done as a pass and all you need to do is just adjust the angle a little bit so the first a little flatter so when you kick it it's not going to come back to you but it's actually going to go to your partner so we're going to try a couple of kicked passes now with clockwise spin 
how_06085_0028940_0029820 some spin 
how_06085_0032500_0038410 have you noticed she wanted to try to put more spin on it when you do that kick pass 
how_06085_0039230_0039890 is here 
how_06085_0040580_0047140 drop down both then ryan could go into a bunch of different combinations from there 
how_06085_0047140_0048840 it can also do your other foot 
how_06085_0049220_0052890 splendid here in kicker with the other foot 
how_06085_0056180_0060540 spin it here and kick it with the other foot 
how_06085_0062800_0063830 it 's a kick pass 
how_06085_0063830_0065760 it's a great way to passersby to your partner 
how_06091_0003300_0011010 in our progression through our one leg functional lower body training exercises this exercise is the hardest 
how_06091_0012550_0015010 i learned this exercise it was called the pistol 
how_06091_0015620_0017680 other people known as the one legged squats 
how_06091_0017710_0023580 either way it's an exercise that demands a lot of balance and a significant amount of string 
how_06091_0025420_0032580 and after you've gone through those other progressions leading up to this and you've made sure that you're able to do it you can try this 
how_06091_0034440_0038940 in this exercise basics one likes going to be off the ground that's why it's a one they exercise 
how_06091_0039490_0045640 going to reach forward as hard as you can while you're going down and this is what it's going to what it's going to look like 
how_06091_0045640_0047810 it 's easier for me to show you than it is to explain 
how_06091_0048390_0053890 go down so you balance is very required on this you want to grab your foot you can 
how_06091_0054170_0056990 but that's the bottom position and then you come up 
how_06091_0057780_0059130 again i'll just show you another one 
how_06091_0062290_0063410 up and one more 
how_06091_0067000_0068570 important points during that 
how_06091_0069850_0078750 first of all if you have really poor hamstring flexibility you may not be able to go down like that and keep your leg up at the height it needs to be 
how_06091_0079580_0089900 another thing is when you go down always important on any lower body exercise is the knee or going down with has to stay in line with the foot 
how_06091_0090040_0091970 we don't want your knee going out 
how_06091_0092410_0098140 what 's more likely on pistols is your knee or bucklin when you start being tired 
how_06091_0098740_0102130 highly suggests you stop before that starts happening too much 
how_06091_0102780_0106620 all that does is put a lot of strain on the inside of your knee 
how_06091_0107870_0112000 again pistols full depth one legged squats 
how_06091_0112000_0116850 it 's not a full pistol if you're hamstring doesn't touch your care 
how_06091_0117660_0119910 but again reaching forward for balance 
how_06091_0119910_0124990 if you don't reach forward you will not make it down you'd have to counterbalance nearby 
how_06091_0126410_0136050 see when we're in the bottom position we've got a lot of weight on the backside so we've got to reach forward so we can counter balance and then we come up 
how_06091_0136710_0148440 that 's one rep you can do those when you're starting out you may want to alternate legs do one left one right and keep switching so you get some rest in between 
how_06091_0149620_0151130 go ahead and give those try 
how_06091_0151470_0153880 if that's all the leg exercises we have for a day

how_06220_0023570_0033000 in order to remove this there's a couple of screws that you have to remove up on top 
how_06220_0037150_0045090 so we've got the screws out and be careful not to drop them anywhere because they're really hard to find 
how_06220_0045810_0059330 and now we're going to try to pull us out of this is your turn signal bulb clear you twisted and then you pull it out and then you can pull that bob out and put the new went in 
how_06220_0060790_0073300 if you put it back in line up the the little tab share their three tabs you line them up on the socket and then twisted back into place 
how_06220_0073940_0091950 the headlights it's a little bit different twist that and they all come with some kind of a twist mechanism and then once you get that twisted off by lining up the calves with the halls then you can just pull that out 
how_06220_0093830_0098730 you want to be really careful on these light bulbs that you don't touch the actual glass

how_06276_0001310_0003650 in this clip we're going to talk about and maintenance for these birds 
how_06276_0003650_0007040 so basic maintenance obviously food and water 
how_06276_0007480_0012260 the other maintenance is these guys get a little bit bored so you might want to switch out their toys 
how_06276_0012650_0025870 they should have decent amount of distractible toys in their cage that they can destroy and like sift through so obviously anything distractible toy needs to be replaced as it becomes destroyed 
how_06276_0026380_0036040 and these guys also to maintain their feathers quality need either be misted on a daily basis or by a daily basis if he can with a small mr 
how_06276_0036770_0041450 can also offer these birds a lot of them love to take baths you can offer them a very shallow bowl of water 
how_06276_0041760_0050210 put it at the bottom of the cage and these birds will jump in and take a little bath and fluff than the water up over their feathers and let it run down their back

how_06276_0058320_0060080 basically keeps their feathers clean 
how_06276_0060410_0073340 also compared to their environment our homes with air conditioning and heat i'm tend to be extra dry and still a lot of times they'll have trouble molting their feathers properly can end up with some damaged feathers if they don't have a high enough humidity 
how_06276_0074180_0083610 again if you miss them a couple of times a day this can help compensate for the low humidity in your home and keeping good feather health for these guys 
how_06276_0084790_0089340 basic other stuff that these guys need is generally recommended that once a year you take them to event 
how_06276_0089340_0093690 that can hold them still and like look underneath their feathers and check underneath their wings 
how_06276_0093690_0101360 open up their mouths and look into their eyes and make sure that there isn't the beginnings of any serious health problems which is difficult for the average owner to do 
how_06276_0101640_0105850 sometimes these guys need to have their nails trimmed as their nails will get overgrown 
how_06276_0107210_0115360 if you take your bird out of the cage we consider taking it outside you need to be decide whether or not you want a cliff these guys wings 
how_06276_0115830_0121460 it can be fun to have a bird that can fly all over your house in coming goes it please but it can also be very dangerous for the bird 
how_06276_0121460_0130090 so you may have to clip your birds wings every twelve weeks to every six months depending upon where and half and your british molting 
how_06276_0130430_0139370 and the other basic things is just a cage maintenance you want to make sure there are any loose strings are things 
how_06276_0139910_0149070 check your cage out make sure there's anything that could get wrapped around a leg sometimes these guys will be playing in their toys and get this piece of string wrapped around a toe or leg and cut off circulation 
how_06276_0149070_0153610 you need to clean out their cage i recommend cleaning it out at least every other day 
how_06276_0153610_0156770 put down a newspaper than clean it up 
how_06276_0156770_0161260 but at least you can tell if your birds been eating and that all of its stools look normal 
how_06276_0161290_0167560 there are not too bad as far as just day to day maintenance you need to consider 
how_06276_0167590_0172330 especially if you've only got one bird that you spend at least a couple of hours a day 
how_06276_0172710_0177940 it 's sort of a more intimate time with your bertie they're sitting next to their cage in talking to them or having them out with you 
how_06276_0178820_0188600 if they've got other birds that they can interact with you don't have to spend as much one on one time you just gotta make sure they're the environment that they live in a safe said 
how_06307_0000310_0004480 i'll talk about which notes are most important in a cord 
how_06307_0004970_0008560 before we start building cords with extra tensions on them 
how_06307_0009270_0011470 so let's look back at our major scale here 
how_06307_0013480_0014850 seven notes of a major scale 
how_06307_0015550_0021380 now primarily the first thing you look at his is the cord major or minor 
how_06307_0021900_0023240 that has to do with the three 
how_06307_0024130_0029780 even before that the route note is the letter name that you're going to see that starts off the court 
how_06307_0029780_0036020 so if you had c c minor seven flat five court 
how_06307_0036640_0039220 see that's going to be your starting point 
how_06307_0039990_0043570 minor that tells you whether the cords major or minor 
how_06307_0043640_0045450 so three is very important 
how_06307_0046630_0056170 the seven will tell you it's either if it's a minor seven it's a flat seven if it's a regular seven just the number seven it's a flat seven 
how_06307_0056200_0060650 it 's a major seven then you're going to have a natural seven here 
how_06307_0061060_0069160 now as far as five goes if you haven't minor seven flat five this becomes important but unless the five as stated in the cord 
how_06307_0069700_0076560 if it's diminished or if it's flat five the most important notes that you're going to need or the one three and seven 
how_06307_0076560_0085720 oftentimes you can leave the five out and you still retain the quality of the cord just by having the one three and seven especially the three and seven 
how_06350_0005270_0009310 and i'm going to be talking about different gift ideas for a coworker 
how_06350_0009970_0015260 gift to get your coworker would be actually just to buy them lunch or dinner 
how_06350_0016100_0040260 could place a little certificate on their desk or even a coupon now the way that you could give this give them the spray male would be to place a coupon or certificate on the desk saying you can redeem this coupon any day that you like for lunch or dinner for you can even place a date on their just making as creative as you can

how_06677_0000550_0006480 michael bearing with my brain films data org located in salt lake city utah and we're talking about using microsoft windows 
how_06677_0006810_0011080 but i want to talk to you now about is how to adjust the date and time on your computer system 
how_06677_0012760_0019450 for me start by saying that windows xp as a registered trademark of microsoft and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft 
how_06677_0021130_0023780 suggested aid in town on your computer system is very simple 
how_06677_0024430_0036650 it 's important especially because i've had times when her when i've had the wrong time on my computer system because they chose the wrong time zone or something and i'm always going off that clogged and end up being laid to an appointment with them 
how_06677_0037190_0040690 the best way to change the time is to scrawl under the right hand corner 
how_06677_0040690_0051080 if you look down on the right hand corner of your desktop it gives you the time and if you mouse over that like i've done it will show you the current it'll show you the current date 
how_06677_0052880_0058330 if you click on this if you double click on this it will open up your date and time properties 
how_06677_0058360_0060490 greenland 's down to the center of the screen 
how_06677_0061630_0070050 is showing exactly what time it is where i'm located in utah the date and this is how you change it 
how_06677_0070080_0078120 for example here's the drop down menu for months you can change to what your current month is if this happens to be off this is heaven forbid month month of august 
how_06677_0078620_0087340 pleasure drop down lists for the ears you can change the year and here you are just click on the date on the calendar of what data this to to get that current 
how_06677_0088090_0091790 it has three times a day in time time zone an internet time 
how_06677_0092240_0104370 when you click on the time zone tab this gives you the chance to choose your time zone ran our in the mountain time zone and i've already clicked went down here automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes that way you don't have to keep up with 
how_06677_0104370_0106320 this way my clock was always an hour off 
how_06677_0106370_0107430 because they never checked that 
how_06677_0108130_0117200 the third appears your internet time this is going to synchronize your clock with certain websites 
how_06677_0117760_0127270 unlike here's a website timed out windows dotcom if you click the update now button it will automatically update your date and time for you so that you don't want to do it manually 
how_06677_0127750_0132740 that 's just a quick shortcut to do it but usually i know date and time anyway 
how_06677_0133230_0157460 it 's pretty much the simplest way to do that that's important because it with all of your computer your your automatic your savings and you're on your or your savings in near your files were all saved by date and time and if this is not accurate than it can be hard to do system restores or to restore certain deleted files if you're dating times are off 
how_06748_0000900_0007220 can we talk about why it's important to combine these groups and to know into practice all of them 
how_06748_0007440_0010690 because on the drums you'll find that they all have their advantages 
how_06748_0011220_0024450 for me my preference is traditional but i still work on all of them just because i know it's going to make the world a more well rounded drummer made easier and have more options available to me 
how_06748_0024870_0032780 for instance in traditional here like this he time ago to this side of the drum set a pretty much switched to fringe group 
how_06748_0032990_0034620 it really helps with the ride technique 
how_06748_0035000_0044380 so as i am going around the drum set and trying to use the natural bounce of the drum and the stick without playing in the drone but actually play a little bit off the drum 
how_06748_0044380_0046590 when the drum and the symbols and everything help me 
how_06748_0046860_0056740 so if i'm going around a drum kit notice as i went this way my grip started to change with my right 
how_06748_0056740_0063260 in the uk and back to this 
how_06748_0063430_0066730 same thing as i was talking about between the rise in the snare drum 
how_06748_0067160_0077130 all this really helps out as far as carrying it over rather than twisting your body and losing your balance and for me it just gets me they're a little quicker 
how_06748_0078040_0082030 so that's how i really do feel combined these groups can help 
how_06749_0009600_0022270 beginning on the tenth fret tuesday and then the third and fourth fingers on the fred and second finger on the g on the eleventh fret and of course barring the last two

how_07509_0004950_0006340 with the finishing touches the lips 
how_07509_0006340_0027890 the signature point of this luck is armed with the old hollywood starlet it was normally like that read that really like madonna read but with the flapper luck it was that more dark glossy shiny so we're going to combine the two and do like a burgundy shimmery glossy 
how_07509_0027990_0030810 pay lip someone i started out with a burgundy lip liner 
how_07509_0031870_0046150 and she's that nice full lips so i'm not going to overdraw her lips i'm just going to trace her natural lip line and just kind of fill it in with the lips the lip liner by a little bit

how_07509_0079530_0086090 being a lot of benefits to using a little bit of a lip liner 
how_07509_0087810_0096420 and again said very neutral you don't want to look like a harsh lip line just basically shaping the lips 
how_07509_0099150_0100910 for an hour and start with the lipstick 
how_07536_0000840_0004140 so now i'm ready to go ahead and extrude the handles for the garlic jar 
how_07536_0004660_0012170 the first thing i've done is i've brought a board over here so that i have a place to lay my extruded handles that's portable 
how_07536_0012790_0022770 now before you put the clay into the extruders you want to check and make sure that your dies lined up properly so that you don't have any edges of your form getting cut off 
how_07536_0022770_0031760 the plunger out of the way drop your cylinder of clay and the exterior names off the in 
how_07536_0032670_0036170 the first couple of times you move this plunger nothing's gonna come out 
how_07536_0036640_0040330 it 's just the clay conforming to the shape of the barrel 
how_07536_0042180_0045640 but then once it does start coming out you just want to push very slowly 
how_07536_0045640_0048960 that was an air bubble 
how_07536_0052800_0055510 then bring the bottom of the clay 
how_07536_0056290_0062820 you can see that this portion right here that's where the air bubble popped out 
how_07536_0063150_0064410 as sometimes happens 
how_07536_0064410_0068990 we 're just going to need to cut that right there and use from here over 
how_07536_0071180_0077340 and you want to go ahead and extrude everything that's in the cylinder out 
how_07536_0077370_0078490 it makes more sense 
how_07536_0078490_0084880 even if you're not going to use all the handles right now you can cover them in plastic and save them for another project later 
how_07536_0085680_0094390 just keep them on your board 
how_07601_0000980_0008600 where did i get started on how do we bring this horse up tire up and get ready for a fun day of western events 
how_07601_0009140_0014910 i want to be sure i'm leading my horse in the same fashion that you would walk side by side may be holding hands with a partner 
how_07601_0015520_0023000 i'm going to hold the extra length of leader open my left hand held in a way that it could never wrap around my hand on my wrist 
how_07601_0023490_0030640 in my right hand is going to be that guiding hand that stays close up into the horses halter but still on the rope area 
how_07601_0030640_0035520 i 'm going to walk next tour looking ahead to where i'm going keeping her side by side 
how_07601_0036190_0041000 or write a period of the secure rail world then attach her with a safety net 
how_07601_0041480_0053700 by safety not begins by putting that length of rain over the back making sure she's on an eighteen inch length we don't want her to be able to get her head down that road caught up maybe between her legs 
how_07601_0054620_0061380 i like to think of it as a safety not i have to go all the way around a complete twist 
how_07601_0061510_0078990 so i look at it and i've got a piece of the leader of twisted around each other then i bring up one end to create that looper circle pull a piece of the lung leader of through so it's a loop and then i've got this longer piece that i can keep aside 
how_07601_0079880_0095830 if this horse word ever get into a situation that caused her to do what some horses might pull back i'm going to be able to release her from a safe distance and perhaps even on the other side of this rail so i'm not anywhere near where it could become flailing hooves if she were scared enough 
how_07601_0096380_0100840 we always say though don't ever sacrifice yourself for the safety of the horse 
how_07601_0100880_0105610 if she gets herself into a position that's unsafe for her letter stop and figure it out 
how_07601_0105930_0112840 we don't want to jump in there and put yourself at risk as she tries to figure out how to get away from the tether that's made her so scared 
how_07624_0000180_0005490 while everybody on john grain from the martial arts teachers association and john graden dotcom 
how_07624_0005890_0009140 is the front kick on the shield there's a couple of thought 
how_07624_0009200_0012810 part of me from post are mixed martial arts my good friend mr joe renewal 
how_07624_0013810_0018910 when he is holding the shield i liked him to be fighting stance face in me and he's going to have a conscience 
how_07624_0018940_0023600 wonderfully face in his solar plexus way because a good kick go right through the hidden so plex 
how_07624_0023600_0027610 we turned sideways just a tad lincoln absorbed and was a little bit better 
how_07624_0028030_0034230 and also i want him to exhale when i hit it again making sure he does it at the wind knocked out of him so let's take a look at frankly on the shield 
how_07624_0034630_0039080 for posture of frantic as you know because you watch all my clips we do it and for what 
how_07624_0039080_0043210 once can lead to fold pulling the nearby to is the actual extension 
how_07624_0043210_0046270 when i extend this front kick i'm going to hit with a ball of the foot 
how_07624_0046530_0050480 notice that the foot is poetry but the toes of pull back and out of the way 
how_07624_0050790_0057360 we 're not going to reform the kick very quickly so does get caught in the up and then from there i will sit back down to my father stance 
how_07624_0057770_0060760 as i throw the kick two important things 
how_07624_0061450_0070410 when a breather gives it more power that can wait you exhale to thrust my hips which gives me additional power 
how_07624_0070410_0081100 so not just kicking with my leg i want to get as much of my body weight behind that as possible so from here i'm and a good garden since there is a tendency to rush the kit 
how_07624_0081390_0087540 make sure you take the time to fold correctly fold high and fold tight striving straight through 
how_07624_0090080_0092990 there you go

how_07764_0000300_0002770 in this clip i want to talk to you about freestyle motocross 
how_07764_0003060_0006700 freestyle motocross really can put in itself on the map 
how_07764_0007040_0013750 it used to be just kind of a lot of free riding out in the hills maybe i'll in california boma a lot of places like that 
how_07764_0014000_0015290 guys just sit and dirt jumps 
how_07764_0015560_0021800 these days it's coming into the stadiums in the x games to gravity games the mountain dew tour 
how_07764_0022690_0023860 the entire series 
how_07764_0023860_0028350 so as long as just a motocross and the supercar series they also have freestyle actual series 
how_07764_0028350_0029870 we can catch him on tv all the time 
how_07764_0030430_0037020 need adams travis pastrana and kenny bartram these guys they're all just been instrumental in the motor crossing 
how_07764_0037530_0046030 back in one thousand nine hundred and nine when carrie heart flew his first backflip in new york at the gravity games that was just a huge moment for motor crossing 
how_07764_0046350_0055140 you got guys they travel to china is doing double back flips and variations into their flips and a lot of really cool stuff coming from 
how_07764_0055140_0058660 and across kind of different way to set up your bike for free style 
how_07764_0058930_0063960 bike ride bikes brisk primarily motocross but a lot of guys they cut down their seats 
how_07764_0064200_0068740 make their seat phones really thin because they're not going to you know they're not needed to do the model 
how_07764_0068740_0083730 are not needed that cushion that seat to go faster on those corners and they've got a lot of big like say handholds back here and they're kind of their suspension might tend to be really stiff because they i mean they're on average jump in about one hundred foot plus jumps 
how_07764_0084030_0089490 so you really going to want to absorb those landings and their bikes are completely set up for that 
how_07764_0089760_0091150 maybe a little taller bars 
how_07764_0091430_0096760 cross pads because they're doing a lot a lot of in and out and put their feet up here all the time 
how_07764_0097000_0099110 we don't want to be getting hung up on anything like that 
how_07764_0099770_0102170 and a lot of events are really getting pretty big 
how_07764_0102170_0105500 so that's also the cool thing is that a lot of media coverage from this sport 
how_07764_0105610_0112160 so take a look online you know there's a lot a lot of a freestyle events national and more local pride near you 
how_07764_0112160_0114090 come check it out and that stuff 
how_07764_0114480_0119090 i can't personally do a lot of the tricks that they can do on their but it's really exciting to see in person 
how_07896_0000090_0011500 an important part of a dog guide responsibility is to guide the person around good boy numbers to guide the person around stationary obstacles and pedestrians as well 
how_07896_0011530_0016590 so here we can see mambo avoiding the stationary obstacles but also a pedestrian 
how_07896_0016810_0021270 he stops avoids the pedestrian and then carries on his plate 
how_07896_0021300_0034390 and this is really important part in the dogs work that they avoid everyday hazards not just stationary ones but pedestrians pushchairs strollers anything that might be involved as you're walking down the high street 
how_07896_0034770_0044300 dogs are trained to have a high level of initiative and as part of that finding doors shops is very very important than you own 
how_07896_0044950_0047900 here we see my vote finding the door for greg 
how_07896_0048680_0054350 what we do we train that by repeating the exercise and then given the dog loads and loads of reward 
how_07896_0054440_0079270 once actually is successful so reward and repetition is the key what's really vital because in everyday life everybody wants to do their shopping everybody wants to go to the bank everybody wants to go visit their friends or the store and a dog can really benefit someone by finding those destinations on a daily basis 
how_07896_0079540_0087120 so you don't have to be worried or stressed out about the fact that you've missed the door or you don't know which store going into which shut me going 
how_07896_0087480_0088890 the dog will do that for you 
how_07896_0089220_0090910 again by repetition and reward 
how_07896_0091280_0098460 during exercise finding door and then giving the dog back surprise packs of encouragement 
how_08082_0000980_0011170 people would come in here and generally they can be young and old because they need a tux or a suit even for special occasion 
how_08082_0011710_0021000 i rent them and i would then to young people if you're younger you are usually go into a pram 
how_08082_0021030_0047970 proms i give a special discounts because i believe and cradle to grave and i am hoping and it has happened has been proven that people will then recommend me for their other events and when the young man chooses to get married or something they will come here for their additional taxes be them the google moran and grooms 
how_08082_0048480_0054790 i would then give them a book to select from 
how_08082_0055680_0061420 and now i use a vendor and he has many of the up the date styles 
how_08082_0062250_0083940 and the reason that you would rank attacks over perhaps buying them is that if you do not have them for any use them very often and you do not own one or have won a you would then have eventually a david tux 
how_08082_0085400_0104120 they are somewhat traditional bought if you want the latest and the newest which most people do want when they want this for their special occasion they would come in here and find it easier to rental tops and they would fit them for me 
how_08082_0104930_0115850 sometimes you know if you have your own you may change shape of them and they do not have to be re cleaned when you're finished as it was your own talk 
how_08082_0115850_0117840 would then have to have claimed again 
how_08182_0001110_0002660 hello my name is mark locker 
how_08182_0002960_0006230 string theory is we're going to cover automotive tire change 
how_08182_0006630_0018060 referring to tire change used for on traction devices for driving in deep snow ice or just general its poor weather conditions or window required by law 
how_08182_0019310_0023690 basically there are two different types of changes that are out in available 
how_08182_0023840_0031460 he kind of fall there's a lot of different variations but the kind of fall into brackets of cable chains and standard changing 
how_08182_0031460_0039050 which is like a standard toe chain to style length in a cable chain beings of light aircraft gray and cable rather chain components 
how_08182_0039410_0050710 it will go over those two different types and how to install profit the chains and some basic driving tips for our operating the change for operating the vehicle safely when the change or on it 
how_08182_0051210_0057580 both cobra pre fitting and the actual putting the change on if you were in inclement weather situation 
how_08182_0058090_0063760 so please watch our first segment will cover the different types are no change and go through their uses and applications 
how_08652_0000590_0007760 my name is james computer hardware training coordinator for air connections 
how_08652_0007760_0011890 i started using external monitor your laptop 
how_08652_0012320_0015690 finally got to do is take your plouffe reminder of each year a plug 
how_08652_0015690_0024510 we find the corresponding port on your laptop plug in audience might want to secure 
how_08652_0026780_0030800 now your computer should recognize here the monterey hopefully have a picture up on your screen 
how_08652_0031290_0038470 all laptops are a little different so you might want to go into your display settings and play around a little bit to change your resolution on either one of the two screens 
how_08652_0039150_0042690 one thing to keep in mind as of two different settings and windows for these monitors 
how_08652_0042960_0050330 one is a cloned your display so that everything you see on your display on your laptop is exactly the same as on the monitor 
how_08652_0050610_0053750 the other is that extends so it uses it like a secondary mom 
how_08652_0053780_0056310 click and drag something from one display over to another 
how_08652_0056650_0060600 thus expanding the field of view you have with the desktop 
how_08652_0061360_0068750 my name is james computer hardware training coordinator for interconnection and i just showed you had to install external mondor on your laptop 
how_08808_0000450_0004350 an important trick to learn when to juggling three clubs it's called over the top 
how_08808_0004390_0010280 very similar to the ball version but with clubs you have to worry about the spin 
how_08808_0010430_0016470 so to get a club to travel from the outside of this hand to the outside of this and the more complicated than doing it with the ball 
how_08808_0017240_0019520 with all you can just do a normal throw over the top 
how_08808_0019990_0026370 with a club we have to do is turn to throw sideways that will spin like this over two other hand 
how_08808_0026760_0036630 for sure what that looks like over the top with a club if you see my throws like this are in a plane traveling out for me like this spinning this way 
how_08808_0037180_0049580 over the top is in a play ninety degrees from that and spinning like that something like that so i put that into the powder again just like that 
how_08808_0050110_0052110 others throws a little complicated at first 
how_08808_0052160_0057250 we have to think about turning your risk to the outside and then throwing over 
how_08808_0058220_0061280 and make this work where we're going to do is just practice with one club 
how_08808_0061680_0062680 it would be like this 
how_08808_0062980_0064530 will have your normal throwing stance 
how_08808_0064860_0077170 going to turn near club out ninety degrees then you're going to flicker out to the side you only want to spend once and that as is coming down like this need to catch ninety degrees out again with your left hand like that 
how_08808_0078150_0084950 and you need to get this throw clean with both hands so that you can do go over the top pattern with either head 
how_08808_0085490_0086520 something like this 
how_08808_0087680_0092550 so takes quite a bit of practice or if you work on it long enough you can work it into your pattern 
how_08808_0092590_0096800 it 's a very good visual effect people like outlooks over the sauce with three clubs 
how_08944_0038740_0040880 it's called a whiskey separately 
how_08944_0044830_0047380 otherwise it'll just be really big shot glasses 
how_08944_0048450_0049530 we don't want to do that 
how_08944_0049530_0054020 we want to kick it to sip are whiskey 
how_08944_0056310_0056690 
how_08944_0059920_0061180 movies and thin 
how_08944_0061990_0063710 see if i can get a couple out of here 
how_08944_0066070_0073960 flipping it over making sure that both sides are about the same thickness 
how_08944_0074110_0074420 applause 
how_09339_0000600_0004490 for the next thing i have talked to you about is about having fun breathing and enjoying her day 
how_09339_0004490_0008810 when learning how to dance make sure you just make small goals for yourself 
how_09339_0009270_0012110 make a big goal so that we get discouraged

how_10398_0004630_0008840 usually you can get most of these at your local music store 
how_10398_0008840_0010850 some of them might have to be special order 
how_10398_0010850_0013620 it depends on what she'd like to use 
how_10398_0013620_0015000 secure sound that i like 
how_10398_0015390_0020780 first of our start off with our outcasts this is kind of like an all around oil 
how_10398_0021630_0028600 you can use this slide chump of hours if you play all kinds of different stuff 
how_10398_0028820_0030840 but his real good lubrication 
how_10398_0030840_0040970 the only thing i don't like about it is that it oils can attract dirt and grime and which can gum upper slide a lot faster 
how_10398_0041870_0051800 the next thing we're going to talk about is super slick and this is probably the mac daddy of trombone slides slide claims 
how_10398_0052090_0057630 a little tube like that tub like that last you probably ten years 
how_10398_0057630_0066680 is fairly inexpensive in a you do need to have a spray bottle with water for this one now 
how_10398_0067230_0078510 this is a non biodegradable substance which is good for fire 
how_10398_0078680_0090080 and also have a all synthetic oil here which is real nice because he only thing about it is that it contains petroleum distillates and it can be bad for you 
how_10398_0090870_0098280 then we have our slide cream this is probably the least i recommend 
how_10398_0098280_0102110 it really can go on for your slide of real good 
how_10398_0102110_0111250 a lot of old timers will use pawns just facial cream and don't recommend that as well 
how_10398_0111250_0117520 really gums are bad and makes your slide feel pretty dirty and nasty 
how_10398_0117520_0122380 so i guess the best one i would recommend is the super slick 
how_10398_0122790_0128150 and that will help keep your trombone young and need a little bit and i hope you keep your side very slick 
how_10398_0128580_0131270 those are some types of slides lubrication

how_10641_0009550_0013520 so it's a real good basic movement for other arm movements 
how_10641_0014230_0016500 we're going to start with putting our arm out 
how_10641_0017600_0019980 so you get a clear shot of my shoulder here

how_10641_0022590_0027630 lifted up slightly not too much because we don't want to lose our nice long neck here 
how_10641_0028200_0030680 began to slide it as far back as we can 
how_10641_0031170_0033000 and then press that shoulder down 
how_10641_0033350_0035620 and then bring it all the way to the front 
how_10641_0035940_0040840 so i always like to start with a box movement first make sure you're hitting all of those points 
how_10641_0041150_0043330 and then you're going around it out and make it smoothes 
how_10641_0043750_0047020 so let's try that with account for on our movements

how_10641_0074180_0078840 we don't want the movement out here to be bigger than what your shoulder is doing 
how_10641_0079420_0081720 practices on both sides of your body 
how_10641_0082180_0092610 and then you can practice alternating them

how_10652_0036670_0038930 and as you can see it's just very neutral 
how_10652_0039510_0043090 barry neutral but it has an iridescent to look beautiful

how_10652_0079910_0080880 a couple of time

how_10655_0050730_0052060 it can be a collapsible 
how_10655_0052460_0060280 those things can be catered to this god but they have to be based on relationships are not finances are not anything

how_10691_0004470_0035160 we're going to decorate the roof will make a few decorations but first will decorate the roof and we're going to use our match sticks again the way we do this is we coat the top of the milk carton and angles down with glue and we can either brush along with a paintbrush or we can have the kids who are doing the project if they want to just smeared with their finger and while it's still web 
how_10691_0035160_0052770 we lay across the mat matchsticks we use a solid color red tiled roof so we chose for this project all the red match sticks and will lay them across the top of the milk carton 
how_10691_0055020_0064540 using a solid colors recommended because we have a lot of colors on the arms of the windmill so we don't want to make it too busy 
how_10691_0065590_0072470 the red itself is is also gives a nice so realistic touch to that it looks actually like a roof 
how_10691_0073220_0109460 so the match sticks actually fit nicely across the top of the windmill they don't have to fit exactly the same measurement as the as the top of the carton but if you lay them across a double them up even though they hang over a little bit they still fit nicely onto the answer the the side of the milk carton and we only have to do one side to side obviously in the front that's going to be seen when we go all the way down to the bottom of the of weren't angles and starts going starts going vertical again 
how_10691_0111400_0128260 is really just for decoration and it's not a necessary part of the project obviously if you want to paint directly onto the milk carton different designs are different different types of pictures you can also do that

how_11012_0000130_0000630 again 
how_11012_0000630_0003230 jason catch mark from my space for musicians 
how_11012_0003230_0006160 i'm going to show you how to check if your friends are online 
how_11012_0006820_0008900 it 's very easy and there's a couple of ways to do it 
how_11012_0009040_0010100 first things first 
how_11012_0010100_0015150 start with the basic and you just quit your mouse over friends and click online friends 
how_11012_0015600_0019340 when you click it take you to a page you're going to see everybody that's online 
how_11012_0020640_0025180 so you could see that their online but there's a couple other ways to tell if their online 
how_11012_0025430_0034310 if you go to their myspace page will actually have this little green text with the orange by and it'll be flashing like this and say online 
how_11012_0034310_0039760 so that's another way if you're on the profile of see if they're actually online maybe they're checking their messages or something 
how_11012_0040100_0041230 such a good time to catch him 
how_11012_0041830_0062970 aside from that the third way would be if you're on your homepage and let's say you're in your inbox will do is actually load on the right side air when you're checking messages other online friends 
how_11012_0063150_0067950 so maybe you're actually sending a message to one of your friends you'll actually see them show up here 
how_11012_0067950_0074390 if you have a lot of friends and only show a few of them but there's another place that it'll show the online friends 
how_11012_0075070_0077320 that 's how you check to see if your friend is online 
how_11012_0077320_0079650 jason catch merck from my space for musicians 
how_11184_0003500_0015510 in addition to forms of permanent idea that which are actually directly on your dog then there's also id tags that you can order from companies and have on the color 
how_11184_0015840_0031000 so you take a look at ursus collar here on her collar she's got her name her owner's name her address the state in town and phone number and that is attached to the collar 
how_11184_0031560_0042780 so you can put this on the dog wall there walking the reason why it's still good to have some form of permanent id is in case the color comes off 
how_11184_0043210_0061690 sometimes people actually don't like to have colors on the dog especially if they're walking with multiple drugs and does might be playing with each other because that can set of a potentially dangerous situation where one gets the color stuck on their jaw any other drug can actually choke 
how_11184_0061980_0070810 so you don't always want to have a collar on your dog but it is an option to put tags on the collar if you are going to have collar on your dog 
how_11333_0000720_0004970 another drill that will help you were ballhandling which i had to learn 
how_11333_0005000_0009180 i remember having learned is called the figure eight the urethra
