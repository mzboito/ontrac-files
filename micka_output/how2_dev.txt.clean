by name as joseph s sydney and the member of calcutta racing pigeons club 
a lot of people look for the eyesight 
the ice sane around i pupil there are some adaptation the cause 
the ticket the adaptations the better the birds 
is a very good for bird for breeding purposes and for recent purpose 
this exercise is running up and down and we're going to utilize the stairs or the steps within our houses that we have front porch back porch anywhere you can find steps you can do this 
this is a great exercise you can use as a warm up for your other in home exercises or you can do this as a cardio exercise in and of itself so if you're going to utilize it has cardio do it for about five minutes and they do some other steer exercises as well for cardiac 
simply put running up and down start off with the basic step so you bring your whole foot to the center of the step up down down down down 
we feel comfortable with this you can start to run up down down 
so you can perform about a minute on one side and then switch to your other foot 
now you can do just one step or you can run all the way up your staircase turnround run all the way down just like if you were running stadium steps 
so that is running up and down on your stairs 
we can get these at any outdoor store and they unfold from a very compact peace 
essentially like a mylar aluminum foil 
by putting these over your body 
even if you're a buck naked it will reflect your body heat and retain it 
for the next thing you want to do is make sure you can get some hot liquids into you or perhaps even an fmri 
we always bring with us ready meal 
can be purchased an army navy stores across the country 
and always bring a thermos full of real hot coffee or soup 
applause 
is a clip on facials will be talking about extractions 
but after reclaims and exfoliate the face what we do is extractions 
what that is where we're moving all of the black heads all around the face 
he has any other chen we even get some in the years if they need that 
mainly focused around the nose and what this because it uses the all of the lack heads out of the face so there's no bacteria in there and what that does bring it to the surface will take it out so it doesn't cause a pimple or anything like that on their face 
so what we're going to do is we take our extraction tool and we go round face and we focus around the nose in the ears usually in this area in the teeth zones here here and right here 
what we do is we remove all those black heads right there and then we take them off with a long warm washcloth and we can't go to our next station hostage 
we're going to be teaching you the side sparkler exercises 
so these are great to tone your arms 
it really puts the dell toys to good work here 
it also teaches you're so shoulder stabilization and scapula stabilisation while keeping the chest open and the belly drawing him 
to begin as exercise we start employee stance heels together feet about toes about this distance apart and zip up through the inner thighs all the way through the crown of the head lifting 
when i think about lifting the ribs up off the hips shoulders down 
reach your arms out to the side and if you notice we're going to have a very loose grip on the weights and our fingers are going to reach long 
shoulders down and pulled up telling him 
begin to circle the arms 
a little tiny tiny circles as if you're spiraling out to the opposite wall 
we want to reach those fingers as far out to the walls you can get 
keep breathing 
people in the belly in and lengthening the arms 
when a fearless right in here through the deltoid and reverse the circle 
keep spiraling out out towards the war pulling that belly in an up lengthening through the arms but 's really stabilizing through the shoulders 
one more deep breath 
exhale and pull the belly and and and lower the arms release and relax 
and those are the side sparkler exercises 
we're going to discuss attaching the petals to the pedal board 
the pedal board will come with velcro similar to this or if it doesn't if you have one with wood on it for example you could buy the velcro but you'd have to buy both parts 
this you would cut the size of the backside of the pedal 
peel off the adhesive 
with the onto the underside of the pedal and the fabric concern here is receptive to the velcro 
it holds a very strong bond 
it can't even yank this off 
and that will keep them in place 
one problem without having a pedal board is if we had these petals all strewn across the floor during a gig they would shuffle around 
if he kicked him they move out of place and oftentimes that could result in a plug coming out which it 
hand and getting you get a huge buzz and then you've got a real problem on your hands 
so this will keep everything really secure and keep problems from like that happening 
this is john stewart and this is how to select an area for building a fire 
when you build a fire you want to build it on flat ground 
so you have the nice stable a to set your fire up and build the firing around it 
we don't want to put it on a heel 
in that case you might have blogs that are burning they might take off down the hill and escape so you want to make sure you have a flat stable service to build your fire around 
we want to make sure that you build your fire near water source 
is key in case you have an accident where the fire gets out 
but most importantly so that you have water to actually put the fire out once you're done using it 
so make sure you're near water to where you can transport the water to the fire 
thirdly you want to look for an open area in the trees 
is key so that when the smoke from the fire rises it has a place to escape 
if you haven't real high vegetation area in the trees towards the smoke came built escape the smoke or build up all in your camp site and urges be miserable for you and your other campers having a brief smoke and all that 
so make sure you have an open area in the trees the smoke can escape 
lastly try and build your far off the beaten path 
is so that you don't have it near passive animals other campers because animals and stuff like that we naturally drawn near fire and so you won't be off the beaten path from them 
so look for animal tracks and make sure you put it away from them 
this is how you select an area for building a fire 
do you find yourself rushing from activity to activity this job that job multitasking here and there 
if that you meditation is a way to calm rejuvenate and distress your life 
by mistake 
cindy mastery and willing and i are going to demonstrate how to meditate 
for meditation is so good to clear your mind and allow new thoughts just to allow yourself to just slow down and be not be a human doing that fear human being just for a few moments every day out of your life 
it's easy to do 
we just find a comfortable seated position 
we want to feel your pelvis routing down into the core of the earth 
we want to link them through your spine lifting lengthening out of the hips to the armpits rolling your shoulders back and allowing your heart to expand 
lengthening up through the crown of the head following your eyes to soften clothes 
you may not be able to just completely clear your mind 
i really don't know anyone who can 
but what you do is focus on your breath just softly inhale and softly exhale focusing on the breath being aware of how the air feels as it touches your skin and how it enters through the ring around the nostrils and feels as it goes down into the deepest part of your lungs 
feeling the air warmed by your body is it returns 
would become a participant in your thoughts not participating and thoughts been an observer of your thoughts rather than a participant in those thoughts 
just let yourself go 
so a really great way to de stress calm your body calm your mind after our stressful days of multitasking is to come into a regular practice of meditation 
it's also a great way to start your day 
starting your day in your day will help you be a calmer person

who says that finger painting has to end with preschool 
actually on a lot of paintings including those are the oils acrylics artist still will occasionally i'm used their digits to get certain painting effects on the canvas 
guns and paint on the tips of my fingers here 
nice advantage of fingers over brushes you can basically load up two at a time at least or even five you want to go crazy 
and anyway and the basically what you can do is you can tap in here and you can drag what the tips of your fingers 
the tips of your fingers should give a little bit being fleshy so also they'll be very very natural getting into some of these nooks and crannies 
can really push the pain around quite well by using your fingers 
very very neat blending techniques 
again this is just using your fingers and nothing more magical than that 
whichever never to as soon as number one starts getting a little dryer 
and come up with all sorts of various articulations here 
but as fun as finger painting can be it of course is incredibly messy and safety warning here folks 
if you're using oil paints for any of this make sure an extra extra extra wash your hands when you're done with this 
for oil paints are not to be ingested 
it can be very dangerous if you do that 
so make sure you're getting all the oil paints off of your fingertips and especially out from underneath her fingernails where the paint can enter your bloodstream 
i 've heard of at least one man who was hospitalized because he did not get all the oil paint out from underneath his fingertips 
little word of caution but hey soaps not a stranger to you or pumice stone isn't it will be just fine about keeping clean 
occasionally being able to use a finger method for your paintings 
what you can see this as a very long 
like a rat's tail 
hairless pretty much and its daily but it does something that a rat's tail doesn't do and that is pre hansel and our grasp 
just see how it holds on to my finger 
well that's going to hold onto the trees 
so it has its tail an extra limb to grasp when it's in the trees 
and how we're going to learn a little bit about the basics of the doctor wrecks module 
dr read a lot like having your own mpc on reason 
can manipulate individual slices that you've assigned and they've actually assigned some different loops for you to play yourself 
can either play the individual loops through the keyboard or you can let them run as entire loops through your song 
so what we're going to do right now is basically assign a whole entire loops insists the easiest thing to do 
so we're gonna go over here to our software reich brick the bottom going to select dr wrecks lute player and we're going to click the folder 
were in the reason factory sound bank which is here so i'm going to go back and show you i landed up 
so we're going to go to dr rick's instrument moves so unlike on ourselves and now you can preview they're here and the individual that directs module by clicking the preview button 
the original looped tempo was ninety three beats per minute and the temple my sagas and ninety six but since this particular loop has been previously sliced perfectly by the reason software 
that these individual sounds fire off when you need them to and the individual beach so you can actually take the temple of your song up or down 
and it won't affect how this arms luke sounds it'll match the individual songs 
and now we're going to add this little this little hip hop loop to our project make sure the dark directors highlighted first in the central sequencer window 
gonna hate to track and there is your information for that particular loop 
we're going to play though it sounds 
the me show you how to play the individual notes when you bring up when you change the edit mode window you can see the actual assignments 
each individual slice that's been slice by reason itself to take the window up and show you that these are eternally and each one of these individual slice is a sound 
signed to the keyboard itself so when you play 

and in this series of clips i'm going to show you how to organize your very scrapbooks supplies 
the next thing we want to organize our die cuts and punch out 
one thing you can buy is a container like this 
i can beat organizer 
when you open it up it has a compartment for all your difference die cuts and punch out 
this is a great way to keep many different punch out in a small compact space 
this containers also small enough that it fits inside a drawer saving me even more space at my work station 
another option we have is to buy individual plastic containers like this one 
they come and squares 
it can also buy packs of round ones 
in their small and like the slit your small cuts fit inside 
one thing i recommend as if you're gonna go with the individual route is to take one of the dye cuts on the outside sit at a glance you know what is in each and every one of your containers especially if it's one like this that you can't really see through 
another option we have is to buy like a coupon or check organizer like this one 
and you could label each section and keep your diet cuts in here 
it's really important when you find the time and your child's calendar from preschool usually they have calendars maybe they're on vacation end of december for winter break 
it 's a really good time to plan your vacation from work if you're a working mother and sit down with your child by all the necessary things the books everything that will give your child up for potty training and get them ready 
make sure you don't have any events planned birthday parties anything outside of home it's better to do it at home where your child feels safe and secure and really comfortable because that will make the transition from using diapers to under a lot easier 
my name is steve munoz 
duncan business machines and we're going to talk about what are the cheapest inkjet cartridges for your printers and your fax machines 
first three types of ink cartridges 
one of zero am which is original equipment by the manufacturer expensive but good quality 
refurbish one is one that you don't have the empty cartridge therefore he had to pay for the carnage and the ink 
the cheapest is of course you have your old cartridges all foreigners say and you take them in 
they re film so all are known as potent ink in it and you have the old cartoons 
best way if you have your own garden is you're going to be able to buy cheap inkjet for your printer or your facts 
i can give you know prices but they're cheap 
that answers the question to cheaper car 
high on bobby low roof 
right now we're going to focus on our legs 
when it comes to strength conditioning lot of people think the calves are the most important part of shopping 
they're not 
actually this part of your legs right here 
so that's why i'm michael jordan could dunk so well 
got a couple of things that you can do to strengthen your leg muscles 
first thing in my favorite just squat jumps 
when you do a squat jumps you want your feet about shoulder width apart 
you're going to lower yourself down keeping your back straight pushing the boat to the floor 
what you're going to do from here his job 
as your job you're just going to squeeze your feet together 
when you come back down to the floor against read the legs 
cameron demonstrate for you 
second if you've got a chair around or maybe some stairs you can do a couple of stare raises 
a very simple put your left foot up on the chair or the stair an are you going to do is push 
i would alternate insets on both these exercises doing three sets of about one 
and those are just a few things you can do to strengthen your leg muscles 
another thing to look out for and this can be very important 
quite often has have inner tags and even though the lighting on this particular this isn't on canvas had a safari snap on the side and you'll see even though this hat is lined with a gentle cotton it would feel very good on your head it actually has a harsh embroidered tag on the back over that can be very very uncomfortable 
work out for chad's bows seems and joins because while they might not feel bad during the three seconds the has on in the hat shot was that ads on your head for four or five or six hours they can begin to chafe were and become a complete annoyance and now you spent twenty thirty fifty one hundred dollars on a hat you're not going to wear again that's just not good sense 
in this clip i'm going to talk a little bit about sequencing music 
sequencing music is when you create muzak is how the technically called today 
music that his computer generated not real instruments 
but it can sound very close to the real thing 
a lot of times is used in various different types of productions from commercials to film to radio 
what we do is take an instrument channel 
and if you go to the eye on the ussr and you can create a motto or a stereo instruments 
i'm going to create monterrey now 
it gives me options of different synthesizers or drum machines etc 
so on this year i'm going to open amano synthesizers 
from this here gives me the different parameters of the scent itself to change to create different types of sounds 
when you go to channel to create a stereo drum machine 
logic you can only have drum machine the stereo 
and it's going to bring up the drum secrets 
usually when creating beat i start with drums first 
start getting everything into the right tempo with the backbeat 
then you can add other sounds such as a base or whatever the sound maybe 
sounds 
here i'm on the drums playing a wooden blocks 
and the way to change between different sense is actually not by clicking on the send the soft on the channel your plan from 
whereas now that i'm on this base thing going over my drums 
so that's the beginning intro to creating a sequence track on logic 
so in those twenty seven different emotional reactions that we have every hour some of them are going to be on that spectrum of anger 
once we recognize the body symptoms again the noise of the teeth clenching of the hands one of the most important things that we can do is called changing our state 
and that's a very very simple thing to do actually 
a couple of key things to remember 
one is that when emotions are coming up and we don't want to feel them regardless of which emotion it is our tendency is to hold our breath we literally stop breathing 
and so the fastest easiest way to change your status to take a deep breath and now i don't mean i don't mean an exasperated side that's not what i mean by a deep breath 
literally mean filling up your whole body with a full braff using all of your lungs to bring in oxygen that life giving energy and move that other energy through the body through the exhale so it's a big and literally your physical state changes and because emotions are chemicals in action in your body than your emotional state changed 
another thing you can do is you if you're sitting down stand if you're standing up sit down if you're standing still walk movement is a great way to get energy emotion actually to go out and through the body so you can let go of whatever it is it's going on 
these are all things that we've been talking about that you can do when your first recognizing that in fact you're annoyed frustrated angry whatever word it isn't that big spectrum called anger 
let's take the next few segments and talk about what you can do and anger has been built up and you want to let it go so that it doesn't explode in the wrong place at the wrong time on the wrong person 
powders can be applied with brushes or the powder puffs 
part of has a great if you are just doing a one time application or there's a lot of concern as far as bacteria or sanitary concerns in general 
powder puffs are disposable so that's a great way to just use them and then get rid of them 
brushes are a little more durable 
i really love real hair brashest when it comes to a good powder brush 
make sure they're nice big fluffy so you can cover large areas in the phase 
a great way to ensure the longevity of your brushes is to really frequently wash them 
what i personally love to do is to use a mile baby shampoo and rinse your brushes with lukewarm water and with a mild babies shampoo 
then to dry them lay them on the edge of your table so the air can circulate around the entire brush and everything will dry evenly without creating any mold 
every use blow dryer on them 
is not a problem 
penn has to have one of my legs outside of her guard 
here 's a pin 
if i put my hand between her next even let's think this isn't still appeal 
inside opinion 
inside gardening 
himself position 
because i've got time and the other side 
for mountain it's like this if you answered your legs to spread them out this is still a pen 
point being as a songs you are away from her guard and not even a half guard and you are safe and not only that but you are pinning the opponent 
and he had to make sure both shoulders are down them that 
be sure to turn around and face completely down you might be covering your opponent but you're not pinning your opponent 
we want to fill the milk carton up with sand which will give it some weight and that will enable us to be able to put it outside and it can stand securely so when it blows in the wind that the milk carton will not tip over 
where we can have it stand nice and secure so the way we do that is that we try not to open up and destroy the milk carton 
we really could open up the top and just put it right in but the milk cartons today usually come or juice cartons that usually come with a nice cap a nice space that we can use to poor things inside the way that we're going to do it as or make a little funnel out of regular cardboard paper 
we just bend it over and begin to cut the end to give it a nice straight edge 
we roll the ends together until it fits nicely inside the whole of the milk carton 
and then once it is fit inside the hall and nice insecure we can go ahead and poor sand into the funnel and if the sand is a little wet might need the help of a steak her for so long object to be able to stick it inside and make space in the hall so that all the sand can run down 
if you're going to be using wet sand it's a little bit heavier you may not need as much for your partly between two and three cups of whatever you're using whether it's sand or salt or any any other kind of value you can also use some small pebbles if they're more accessible to you 
so we go ahead and pour the sand in this will give us a nice clean look to the window 
we won't have to worry about closing the top of the carton will just be able to seal it shut with the cap 
but it's also important to make sure that the carton itself as dry from the paint that we put on it because the sand if any sand drifts that drifts over or pores over the side it's going to stick to the milk carton and it's going to make the whole thing a little bit messy so just make sure that the milk carton is dry from the painted put on so that when you pour the sand in any sense tricks to the outside world actually wants to be able to be brushed off easily 
this is the way that we fill the curtain up with sand to give it some weight so that will be able to stand nice and securely web will replace it 
how you do 
somebody 
right now what i want to talk to you about is what is really good high what is good distance hostage you perform a dive in the air 
now we've just figured out where maybe you'd like to have the fulcrum 
if you want it forward if you want a little if you want it back 
so that's all 
i know a lot of you though because i've seen it when you dive end up probably fifteen twenty feet away from the board 
well what is really good distance and competitive diving to the end of the board because if you hit the board that's not good at all but if you're too far away from the board it's also not good at all 
so in general most judges are looking for distance that's around three feet away from the end of the board 
i guess that's about three feet 
so you've noticed if you're not within three feet you've got to do something a little different 
it means you probably need more height 
when you get more height you're actually going to bring the distance 
usually if you don't have enough height your distance is out 
we see how they work 
with more height you get the closer you come into the board 
but the less height that you get usually the farther away that you get from the board 
good high compared to the three meter springboard behind me that would be about good height for a dive 
anytime you do you want to make sure that you finish everything before you get to the level of the board so you've got plenty of time to enter the water and make it look nice and clean 
how height and distance and finishing a dive is going to affect you when you try to make it down 
photo liners are registered trademark of computer and so and i am in no way affiliated with computer ants 
this lesson i'm going to teach you about layers 
at the bottom left down here you've got your layer options 
if you want to create a layer or you have to do is click the plus button right here that create a new layer 
give your layer name 
so i'm just going to name this one layer one 
you can also adjust the position and sizes 
bomb going to leave well enough alone and click ok 
anatomy and come up and like my paintbrush here and paint a just to green squiggly line here 
and i'm going to go down here and click the new layer again to create another layer on name that layer to click ok 
i'm going to paint just a red line beside that 
when i select my eraser tool if i come over here and i can erase the red line but i can't erase the green line as you can see because there are two different layers 
switch between layers just by clicking on 
fallen to erase the green line i'm going to have to come down here and click on layer one 
when i raised that 's going to erase the green line but not the red lines you can see 
and if you want to delete a layer or you have to do this select that layer and come down here and click the trash can and that's gone to delete that layer 
also if you want to duplicate a layer just click ted layer and click the to squirt says times to that's going to create a duplicate of that later 
go ahead and delete them 
when you can also adjust the transparency of a layer here 
with these errors you can go up and down or even or you can just manually input 
if you click here you can change the overlay option 
it can go down and selecting multiply or screen 
we can play around with these and see what they do multiple layers 
but that's how you use layers and photo line 
now after you find your break be let's talk about breaking down sounds 
most of thompson or break beaches different sounds 
kicks near open head high 
once you get the brake be what you want to do with actually find a program that you can actually separated sound 
a lot of pcs do it we could put just to kick owner and cut the snare route 
but just as their own air and cut everything else out 
what you want to do was find you break being fun sounds you want 
fun like a little fun and also but they start breaking down a sound 
the kid take their cake shop it bigger by ourselves 
pick a snare shop and make it by ourselves 
pick the high had put it by ourselves 
i saw you start building your beat just by break you down the brake be that you have 
just you know individual sounds so you could make it into the beat that you want 
wash and i'm sure you right now 
first i'm a play the brake beat yourself 
as although things break 
the kick their diet open 
what you want to do is we want to break down 
now i'm sure you have breakdown 
what actually did that was a whole song together 
it was is and to track scenario but now what i did was i just took to kick part and made it just a kid 
sample 
we just here to keep now because i took everything else out and separated or different channels 
but i made a snare his own 
and i'm a diet and then opened here 
follow the same all of them are broken down from the break 
the brake be broken down 
this way this way i could put the high had to where i wanted to go on 
it can take the kick placed into where i wanted to go 
take the snare where i want to go 
a lot of times though others may keep the same pattern as the brake being butchered can change it up 
it removes near a little bit or you get a little bit more kicks or change the kicks up in a different position so you're not one hundred percent copy and the break 
sometimes you may just want to copy to break 
but you may want to add to kick you want to maybe a little bit more based kilgore to snail whatever you want to do so when you're making your b 
but that's what you've gotta do break down to break me to different sections 
hours to start taking the clay from the bottom clean up any of this stuff that might be looking really upsetting was just on the we'll take it off 
starts around it up 
what we're doing right here is called will wage 
bringing up as high as you want 
like a sleigh my or whatever 
bringing up and start chopping down 
what i'm doing right here is pushing down with this part of my hand this part of my hand was making share stay center and the clay folds in on itself 
it's kind of like a two for one there 
forget the moves air bubbles in center the clay and the same time 
as any kind of funny stuff gone down there to make sure you get up underneath it pull it up get rid of it 
so i can feel it with my fingers that there's something going on down there 
we just really need to get rid of that 
legless with the ball planted in between your shoes is basically reverse curl but now you have to control this and stabilize this big cushion of air and that's why they cost to build a bomb 
so we're going to put it between our feet 
control it leave it there and you can have your hands down to your side 
if you want to work the upper torso with it make sure you got your fist with between your chin and the chest elbows out to the side either way 
or if you want to get really advanced chicken heavier arms beside your ears 
remember you're going to have to control that momentum 
but start out just by contracting and releasing 
exhale and inhale 
try to maintain neutral palette posture and if you want you can lift and lower with your gaze just staring right to the ball or down at your abs 
contract and release of course excelling on contraction inhaling on elongation 
a new could really feel that one start to work quick work your way up to ten to twelve reps 

nikki was studio soiree 
once we've conditioned our legs strength wise and also endurance wise because it doesn't feel very good we can actually do inversions to help keep that conditioning active and also to help us with our lower back exercise 
because we're going to just do back extensions 
we really really really need to be concentrated mindful and they absolutely cannot use any momentum 
if you have a strong lower back i promise you'll find far far less back pains than what you may have 
getting into this whole can be as simple as doing any kind of inversion but i'll assume you don't know how to do and versions and i'll just to kind of a handstand 
we want to face the pole so i have to do the handstand this way 
either way will place our hands get upside down and then we just want to hold the pole with our legs 
once were here we can just kind of do back extensions 
all while getting used to that torture to our legs that is holding herself up with our legs 
today only talking about different and gift ideas 
first already talking about gift ideas for boyfriends 
another great gift is a car sound system 
unusually range from about four hundred dollars two thousand dollars and over and just depends what kind you get 
my boyfriend actually received that as again 
he liked it a lot because he tended to like to show it off and that's mainly why he wanted it so it kind of boost their ego a little bit 
but they would love you forgot them sound system 
make sure that it has an mp three jack that you can plug in iron pollen and the big speakers i go in the back 
to make it even more extravagant you can add a dvd pop out player just all sorts of things you just want to go

today we're going to do an abstract painting 

welcome back 
today we're going to do an abstract painting and it took me a long time to figure out what an abstract painting was but i've found through different experiments with pain so forth that it's really an expression that you can do pretty much what any paint and color 
it 's not so much about form it's really about expressing yourself with colors and shapes and things like that 
this is an example of one of my abstract paintings 
i did this a few years ago when i first moved to north carolina and i guess the colors kind of represent the ocean because we're near the ocean here and now 
surveys show you today is a couple of different tools that you can use to make a beautiful abstract painting that would go nicely in your home 
so when you're speaking with your taylor or maybe the rental place where you're going to be renting your suit or someone that is designing and creating something special for you one thing to consider is different next shapes that you have which are in a kind of alter the shoulder style that your government is going to be tailored in your jacket specifically 
so if you have a short neck you're going to need a square shoulder if you have a long neck you're going to need more of a sloped shoulder and then if you just have a regular neck you're going to need just a regular shoulder 
so there are different ways to measure that are different ways to point out or notice and take into account what type of shoulder you weren't based on your neck whatever neck you've been given 
in all the next or find 
cocaine 
so most of it is going to be from here to here same as we measured our shoulders seem but i'll show it to you on paper season kind of tell the difference and decide what you are because maybe you might be living with them long neck and you just don't realize you have a long neck 
right so let's look at the pages 
right so here we are shoulders style normal and that is it's just like we measured before that point that goes from here to here 
then what we have is a sloping shoulder and as you can see i showed you hear this is for a longer neck 
came along the neck can bring your shoulders down like that and that is from here to there 
there are under longer reading this way 
and finally if you have a short neck and you're stuck here to see before square from here to here 
same thing 
so maybe these diagrams for coffee figure out whether you are a square neck or excuse me a square shoulder a sloping shoulder for there were no regular 
so i've covered some basic movement patterns today 
all of these have really just shown all the functional training movements that you can do and provide yourself with a good exercise program 
please don't be swayed by what you'll see or even read often times and magazines 
when you look around the gym and see various really improper movement patterns 
your body the most important thing is quality of movement performing ten repetitions of of equality movement pattern will give you great results 
no pain no gain this idea is something that is so outdated 
it doesn't mean that you can't be sore sometimes 
is not the idea 
it's getting precision movement where you're focused on how the body works and how it moves and how your breathing and higher contracting the muscles are using 
and you'll see much much better results 
as a final thing if you have any questions always seek professional guidance 
he was in a gym environment is very very easy to hurt yourself so it's about having fun doing things correctly and gaining in getting the results that you want 
so here we are i've got an uphill lie now 
it 's not side hill or downhill or anything it's just uphill it's pretty flat 
so i normally used for the distance that i am from my target i know i normally use a six iron but because it's an uphill lie i'm going to take a five iron to hit it because you lose distance 
so whether the clubs as well after this much but when the ground is lofted that is transferred to the club 
so this is now more lofted shots and if it was on level on a level fairway so you want to take that into account 
one thing you want to take into account as your weight shifting because you're on a dirt on the side of a hill you want to keep your weight more on your front so you don't fall backwards off the ball when you hit 
so i'm just going to normally line up to the ball because there's no i'm not hooking it or i'm not dry fading 
somebody hit the ball straight as i can and i'm going to put a little more weight on my front side and otherwise it will swing nice and easy nice normal 
by taking that extra club i don't have to even think about muscling the ball 
so i had a pretty solid shot there and so that's how you hit often uphill why 
was taken extra called generally depending on the severity of the slow and just keep your balance and this way this shot won't bother yet all actually a welcome because there's different things you can do and it's a fun shot to hit 
so are you wondering what the symptoms are the cavity 
my name is michelle and i'm a dental assistant with solutions and i'm here to explain to you on how to determine what kind of recognize those symptoms 
the three main symptoms really are a few have sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures 
if you're drinking coffee and you get a little slight throbbing pain after you're done drinking or drinking very cold cold water or a cold drink and you start to get like almost shooting type pain those are symptoms on if you possibly have a cavity 
two especially if you're eating sweets chocolates sugar any type of sugar product and you start to get a type throbbing pain and little sensitive area on your tooth that is a symptom of a cavity 
and to whenever you're writing down in your chewing food if once when you write down and you kind of felt like a little as electric kind of shock pain and then you release and it turns to almost a throbbing where you feel like your heartbeat is in your tooth those are all symptoms of to determine on if you have a cavity 
so basically you need to if you're having these symptoms you would need to go see your general dennis so therefore he can do a thorough exam and see if it is a true cavity or if it was just like a fluke thing 
so once again raise michelle 
dental assistant with solutions and aren't just explain to you on how you can determine if you have a cavity 
but i'm going to show you how to make is this wonderful bang 
we haven't attached the handles yet because i want to show you how to do that we're going to make different handles for different banks 
is a very simple pattern with some of you may recognize the middle is a pattern called a granny square and there's granny square is repeated in different colors different combinations of the colors in nine all around the side a row of three nine another of three and another row three 
given stephen these number combinations that are simple makes it easier on you as the pattern continues because you must remember these numbers to make it all work out the same 
for this pattern because we're using the granny square as our base you can add as many rows and columns as you want making his vision like 
this is also great for making something like a blanket or anything else where you can just use patchwork and so it together to make a big piece quake 
is really easy pattern it does take a bit of time but as you can see it looks great when it's done 
named terry and then this segment we're going to talk about how to prevent oily skin 
some of us just have naturally more oily skin than others and actually although it can be annoying at times it's actually a blessing in disguise because the oil air your skin is that just means the more moisture there isn't it and that will prevent you from aging prematurely 
so if you have oily skin and you get frustrated with it just remember it's a good thing 
and now of course one of the most basic things you can do after you wash your face is to use a proper toner 
now want to stay away if you ever oily skin you actually want to stay away from alcohol based donors 
if anyone especially stay away from rubbing alcohol 
some people think that works like a toner 
what that actually does it dries out your skin to the point that your skin has to further make more moisture or more oil and it actually produces an oil your face then than drying out your skin 
so you want to start off with using that after you wash and then throughout the day if you find yourself getting a little oily you can use powder 
the compact little bit of powder 
we can use one with a sponge that will absorb some of the oil as well or one with a brush or there's these great blotting tissues that you can purchase and they will keep the makeup on your face if you're wearing any but it will just remove the oil and dirt 
so it's a quick fix 
it 's a lot it on the areas where your skin might be a little oily and that's how you prevent oily skin 
right we're ready to start our fire 
when i always like to have nearby is my blower just in case it needs a little bit of extra oxygen and air to get to get moving 
i don't think it's going to be an issue today because we've got a nice little bit of wind coming at us 
and that's that speaks to the next point of which areas should delight first 
well you should light all around the fire two three four spots if he can 
but what we want to do is we want to light where the winds coming from because that's going to give us a better chance of getting it catching fire catching all of an unfair 
maybe we won't have delighted in different spots around 
will actually be able to tell once you actually get it in there you can get it lives 
so i'm going to go ahead and dip down here and hopefully you can see this 
and i'm just going to light it it might take a couple of times to get the lighter going 
but you can see you can see insert these a lot further rather than having a handheld later and trying to get your hand in there 
where even using matches and throwing them 
and these tend to work better 
go ahead and see if it's not too late 
because i could get a poem in there 
it looks like it's catching 
definitely see smoke and where there's smoke there's fire 
you can see the smoke on their it looks like it's catching 
make sure that you stand out of the line of the smaller you don't want to be breathing in smoke 
so we've got the starting to have a bonfire 
the next thing that you're going to want to know is your setup 
make sure you know your personal tanks set up very well before you go into your local fish store 
we need to know what size tank you have 
ten gallon fifteen gallon 
to know what type of filter or filtration you have on your tank 
it 's simple sponge filter or do you have an expensive canister filter set up on the aquarium 
is it a three stage filter or is it just a mechanical 
for just biological 
these are things that we need to know before you go into your store so you have the proper information for your local fish dealer 
it also best to know things like let's say what type of gravel you have in their type of lighting you have on various things like 
pose is the extended version of locusts pose 
someone should have mastered that then you can add in greater extension and work on moore's final flexibility and increasing that range emotion 
so come down hands on the shoulders into a resting position 
take a moment to find your navel into your spine so you don't tip that ball that you have sitting on your pelvis and neutral position 
first practice by active arms and active legs just like he did and locusts 
steven ahead in line with the spine active spine leaving everything and parallel position and we're going to reach back and released 
the goal here is not pull on his shoulder joint want to initiate this pose and stretch by a long getting to the top of her head pressing your feet towards your hands never holding your breath in how exhale 
if he can't start by getting your knees off the mat star here 
brush your thighs onto the mat try to keep your head and neutral think scapula retraction but leave that front of the shoulder nice and soft 
joints or your stabilizer 
we don't want to use them to control the movement 
is your muscles that will control that work with the joint 
and you'll find your active range emotion 
great opener for the chest very active quads and spinal flexion 
unreleased down 
fans underneath your shoulders and released back into child's pose and spinal roll up 
definitely make sure your master a locust posed before you head into the bow posts 
my cup has set up and i'm ready to trim it 
first thing i'm going to do is remove the splash pan from my wheel 
set it aside 
now i'm going to use what's called a given grip 
we don't have to use one of these 
we can use three lumps of claims 
to hold your peace in place 
but these work really well 
but i just reposition that to make sure that it wasn't 
half of that i'm going to clean it off 
with us is it's got an inner spiral track 
so as you spin the holders move in and out 
and they're always on center 
it's really great tool 
for now i'll take my little cub 
instead it in the middle 
i will gently make sure that the geffen grip has grabbed on them 
for all the way around 
and now my pieces on center 
and it's not going to topple over 
as a trim it 
ok what are we to do on this drill this was one of my favorite drills 
i'm going to throw the ball to our players 
and i remember these are club players are not pay highly paid professionals but they're good sports and their work and hard out here 
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to throw the ball to gary's backhand and he's going to run around it and hit a forehand 
what i'm going to throw the ball to cannes forehand and he's going to run around it and hit back in 
what this does is it trains you to to learn how to move faster and to keep your feet moving 
plus it's a great work out so you get a little aerobic training and you get to train your explosiveness and you get to train how to move faster 
so here we go 
barry and restart your back and i want you to a forehand 
shot back to the metal 
ken i'm going to start your foreign hit back in his backyard 
back to the middle 
gary again to your forehead geographic and had a forehead 
can tear forehead hit back 
move move 
a good and let's do one more each guys so ready to go carry moves 
move move 
with shot 
can move move move move 

so what this drill does is it really changed move your feet quickly and to watch the ball and to learn how to stay away from it and getting good position 
hi my name is shell garcia trees and a modern dance instructor in austin texas 
i'm going to show you how to do a simple modern dance lateral stretch 
first thing i'm going to do is open my feet into a second position 
so i'm just going to take my feet a little bit wide 
i'm going to have them turned out a little bit so if i bend my knees they would go right over my toes but they're turned out there not parallel they're turned out comfortably 
i'm going to reach up with my arms so that i haven't the in my arms that's very symmetrical to the in my legs 
i'm going to push my feet into the ground i'm going to push my shoulders into my back and then i'm going to reach up and over with my upper body 
i 'm going to keep my head active so it is not hanging its active 
my neck as long my chin is dropped back a little bit and i'm reaching up 
so i feel really deep intense stretch in this whole side of my body 
i'm going to take deep breaths well i'm there 
and i'm going to make sure not to collapse in the side of my body 
ritchie and reaching for the corner of the wall 
and then i'm going to push through my foot to bring my upper body back to center and i can go up and over the other way 
reaching out out out 
coming up and over back to neutral 
so that's a great way to get some lateral stretches in modern dance 
so you can take your time with those stretches as much time as you want 
when a little bit quickly but you take your time 


for about one you have a totally blind handoff where the receiver of the baton is not looking at the baton or the person sending the baton so that can be completely burned where they're running and to reach back and wait to feel the button next to be half blind which is used in the mile really by some third world countries teams that have more chemistry and that requires much practice 
and what they're going to do is they start blind by taking three steps turn back reach grab the baton and continue running 
and then there was the one demonstrated by deron where it was the entire time he was back looking at the baton reach back and that's completely safe although it is the slowest hand off 
in a mile relay you're coming in and your finishing last twenty five meters so you're going to have even to be lactate threshold where your muscles aren't doing acting like they were at the beginning of the race 
when you come here you're going to really need the recipient to help you out and gauge how far you are and that was zero percent blind handoff he looked 
back and reach for it and took it and there was no mistaking where the baton is at anytime 

a light year 
we just started talking a little bit about touch and becoming familiar with your own instrument 
but in general anytime you're playing any steel pans whether it's this one on one of my many other instruments you have to learn that the lower notes as i mentioned before you have to play softly on up to the higher notes which you have to play harder in order to get the same volume 
i'm going to demonstrate again playing this note with the same intensity that i would play this 
in other words i'm going to play the softly 
not going to get much out of it 
if i played this note this larger note with that same intensity i get a lot more out of it 
which you have to become familiar with 
the way become familiar with that is actually just play your instrument and listening just like anything 
lowest no on this particular instrument is over here 
i'm going to play now and kind of use the whole drum and i'm going to try to be aware of how the intensity changes as i moved from the low notes to that the 
the you get a little bit an idea about when i was hitting those high notes had to strike those a little bit harder 
when you get to those low notes you've got to be really gentle on them 
there are also musical choices that you will make 
sometimes you want to get those lower notes a little harder 
sometimes you want to get those little software to be softer 
a musical choices 
learning the intensity that's necessary for each note on your instrument very important 
the split we're going to learn how to reduce fractions 
the easiest way to reduce a fraction for example let's say you have to over eight ok 
these are even numbers pick a number that goes into both divide 
to divide by two and yet one over four feet 
with reduced the fraction 
so you have three overnight then 
divide by three divide by three and you get one over three may 
ensure that the number you divide the top and the bottom by is the same number 
cannot use of different number here and a different number there 
learn how to reduce a large fraction such as within the other clint 
we have two thousand divided by eight thousand well 
match cereals and casual whatever 
cancer tapi cancel a bomb 
we have to have the same number of zeros 
bafflement to over eight this is not fully reduce shit 
by to divide by to cause and you'll get one over four songs 
in two thousand over eight thousand is the same exact thing as one over four 
was reduced fractured to lowest turns always 
another way to lose game of a ball is if the eight ball falls off the table lens on the floor 
if any other object bowling falls on the floor has responded budget for the eight ball burns up on the floor it's considered the last game 
if you're shooting at the eight ball and you make it in their own pocket you designate a certain pocket for the apple fall where a ball doesn't get to that pocket but inadvertently falls into a different pocket that will be considered last game 
a third way to lose his game is if you're shooting at the eight ball you make the ball but during your stroke you committed fall than that people committed to fall during the x during the execution of making them making the eight ball that would be considered lasik game 
three green onions you can also use one red onion instead of three green onions the red onion goes very nicely also eight ounces of federer cheese one cup of greek olives and two pounds of cherry tomatoes 
these are nice and fresh cherry tomato see that the greens are still not dry down there nice and fresh 
look for good tasting tomatoes since it is such a major part of a greek salad k will clean up our vegetables and get started 
now already to seal off the bottom of our bag and we're gonna do one on the inside and repeat the process on the outside as well 
inside you can just use a patch but for the outside we're going to use this really pretty 
except that my shirt right side in and put my hands and it toward savant so i can allow sit out 
lay down on a hard surface like an ironing board or a cutting board 
and i'll never take my apple a k a layer or this area that we had that was the bottom the opening 
you're going to have to iron and on for a while 
it 's going to take about thirty seconds per section 
when i started to a cotton setting and you just want to start working the apple 
on their air got an iron that on and that's going to bind to the fabric and then that's going to seal the bottom of your 
whatever parts you don't use you've just got a cutaway that access 
so we're going to keep smoothness on 
and again it's going to take about thirty seconds perception 
and you know it's on good when you start to pull it away and all you get back as the paper 
i want to keep going over every section that i want to apply 
playing the whole thing so i want to get the edges really 
he can't be too generous with the 
it can even give it up last the steep angles start to notice a moisture pattern on the back of the paper 
so that's how you know it's getting to be done 
so it's starting to pull that moisture thrill 
one of the last but often overlooked steps to cleaning your brushes and a whole lot of other artists implements is shaping 
by shaping i mean making sure the brush he's going to dry and relatively similar shape to how it was beforehand 
so if you have like a square shape here at the top therefore it's going to dry that way 
so what can happen is over time you can see this guy's connoisseurship 
we used to be tampering to the end there and now it's kind of off fuzzy and weird and more like a flat toppling he got a buzz cut down the barbershop 
this can be prevented by making sure you take some very easy steps for shaping 
there are also some oils and liquids and post cleaning products you can get the shape this but the basic the signs of it if you will if it is even as a science is what i do is take a paper towel one of the best still wet and i'm just clean it kind of run through the brush and i'll try and shape it 
oftentimes brushes will spread outwards so basically kind of shaping it and kind of pressing it in a little bit will help keep its shape more and when it dries 
paper towels are very helpful in this regard 
because if you do not do this you're basically brushes life will be into 
other things you can do to keep shape is like if you have some random bristles you can always senior with a little pair of tweezers or clippers that those guys off to help your brush keep its shape 
this is your line of envy from van being bulbs 
in the segment we're going to learn about how to plant arose 
poses or one of the most beautiful and traditional flowers that you can have in your garden and they're very easy to grow 
like other plants they don't need a lot of care they just need a sunny spot with good drainage 
pretty much all you need is a root of a bulb or route 
frozen come from a route so you need a route that's healthy and route that has some kind of growth in some kind of life 
and this rose isn't the best but it's still going to grow and so when i planted i want to make sure that the roots are covered but that the stem is out of the ground 
when i dig my whole i want to have room for the roots to really multiply 
we always want to dig your whole bigger than your plants so that you can dig at some of the soil and that it has something to grab onto and then when the roots grow to they've got some soft soil to wrap too 
well i'm planning their so that the dirt is going to cover where the roots are and then the sprout this starts are going to come out 
whether you use a shovel or your hand to be careful because the roses are kind of prickly 
pretty much just can't recover enough and other tricks to his little stamp and it down a little bit helps it seems that retains more water and doesn't fall over when the first wind hits 
i have a beautiful rose planted in the garden and it was easy to do it only took me a minute and a half and you can do it too in your yard 
roses are very easy to grow sunny spot good drainage give it lots of water once you've transplanted it and i'll come back for years and years 
we're just going to peel the potatoes you might want to put down a a bag or something to collect the pills to make clean up a little more easily 
and you can either use a paring knife or a potato peeler to peel those potatoes and we're going to keep them if you have a small potato you can keep it hall and the larger potato you might cut in half but keep the potatoes in a fairly large chunk like a serving size 
now we're going to rinse are barley just get a container of water doesn't have to be a measuring cup and fill it with water and puts you barley into that car into the water and just stirred around this will help remove some of the starch and sometimes you get a little pieces and things that you don't want 
rinse that and then you just pour the water off into the sink 
he goes computerized karaoke hosted solution is the registered trademark of envision software solutions 
i am in no way affiliated with envision software solutions 
this next clip i'm going to talk about the history 
we're going to come up here and just click on history 
history will save you history 
click it and you could actually see everything that all your performers done their dates the songs they they've song 
been coming to shows and it's a really cool fun thing to happen 
click on performers name you can click on the song titles so you know what they song 
the oddest of what they liked to sing most and what they came 
a good idea for one east china sea who your regular zone 
what i like to do is make sure when i see new people coming on a regular basis i introduce myself i let them know i let them know hey we love that you come to the show 
watch your email address 
and they get him right on my email that way 
this way they know i am 
right next to the history is fun facts 
again another fun way to see what's going on and whose performed the mouse lately and who's been around the most 
quasi perform the songs in the last seven days 
again a great way to start knowing who your people are who's come on a regular basis and who you want to really just play up and say hey thanks for being there 
and just maybe i do little things when i send emails 
i mention these people and people like seeing this in my blog and such things like this 
so remember a fun thing to have when you're when you're involved and people in your karaoke show is making then the stars 
remember when you make them the star you will reap the benefits 
so to fun easy things with this copy host system to really get you to know who your clients are 
right we are ready to talk about solutions 
and at this point in the program what you want to do is pose possible solutions 
you notice i stressed possible because you're going to come up with some solutions but don't think in terms of well these are our solutions and if these don't work the relationship is over 
you may go through a number of solutions before you find what actually works to repair the relationship 
the first thing we have to look at when posing a solution is think in terms of win win strategies 
you don't want a win lose strategy that will not repair the relationship 
and what i'm talking about when lose versus win win 
get everything i want you get nothing 
this is what i want this is the relationship that i see and i'm going to get all of it 
the other person loses 
so when wind starts to become about compromise 
these are the things that i really really want 
this is what you really really want so i'm going to have to compromise a little you're going to have to compromise a little so that we can both when 
and that's what you're going for as you start to pose and and create the solutions 
with my continuing process of explaining rawhide art and the process that i do 
wanted to give you an idea of what of the balls would look like if you have this and then what it looks like when it comes out a wry much more attractive i think 
these are those funky old things from who knows when does say made in usa which is exciting 
that was a tourist type vida but what i ended up doing instead of just having him with his crossed legs was to add his blanket and his alter space 
so it made a little mainly blanket 
businesses tobacco because he's holding his pint 
so this is a little sacred tobacco vince in here and there and put a nice little piece of poor shell their necklace and this for him thinking is i used to get a lot of for up and alaska and hawaii alaska layovers and go to the furriers and they'd let me dig through all their things for bear and a coyote and all kinds of different kinds of first made it fun to use for decoration on these pieces and then i have the human hair braids curry down here and use it again in totally in the round could be like apartment

and of course you should always be able to upgrade the camera 
so start with a cheap camera 
and then you can always upgrade later 
ability is also a big feature for kids 
so go online check reviews and choose a camera which is going to stand up to some hard use 
at the beginning of course is probably best to choose a very simple point and shoot camera 
cleverly in her own you can always upgrade to a camera which has facilities such as an optical or digital zoom 
it should have anti red eye facility 
and perhaps has got a built in macro attachment on 
if you really have the money he might even be able to afford image stabilisation 
lastly don't worry too much about mega pixels 
to find a camera that's easier to use 
easier it is to use the better your child will like it 
and remember lastly don't buy a camera that you like 
they 're probably hate 
i use drums all from one kid 
i like to mix and match sounds in trying to defend machines and logged but within here you can do is we can try to separate are sounds by the actual instruments so that we can have flexibility in the way we play in the way that it's repeated so we do is we were actually just child is this the scenario quake was going at it and then i'll show you how to way or another attribute over it

forget your take care of your eyebrows her eyebrows are nice and fall they're just not as dark as her hair so arm and since this look is pretty natural i'm just going to fill them in a little bit with the natural brown that matches her hair color 
amusing and angled brush 
a little bit goes a long way when it comes to eyebrow color 
that 's why you never want to use a black or anything like that 
he 's a pretty neutral color that matches your hair color 
and i'm just filling in her natural arch 
if she had her eyebrows waxed are plucked beforehand so they're in a nice natural are 
we're just going to fill them in because they give them a little colour and shape 
and after a color the man you like them stick lowbrow brush her brow poem just camo through just to get the excess powder out 
and give him a nice little shape 
of the tremendous difference between the two eyebrows 
i mean this when shapes her eye and shapes her face and this looks unfinished 
applause 
and now we're going to talk about the ingredients for a need for a garlic tomato bruschetta 
we need one quarter cup olive oil three tablespoons chopped fresh basil need one quarter cup finely chopped green onions three to four garlic cloves minced half a teaspoon salt quarter teaspoon pepper for medium tomatoes diced two tablespoons graded parmesan one third cup reduced fat margin and one loaf which is around roughly one pound on sliced french bread 
in traditional factual this is two pieces will equal one hundred and fifty six calories six grams of fat and one gram of saturated fat 
in this clip on board that demonstrate some attacks and he's going to defend and cut 
attacks defend and cut 
and now they're going to be thrusting attacks because you can score with the point 
so let's start that 
standing their own garden the position all what does it bob three gave me two thousand and two 
ok he's in three 
so i'm going to make a thrusting attacks 
actually what he said 
is trying to go through my voice 
go through my voice 
we've got to get overly cut the arm is available 
god 's guarding a promo for the arms available 
right now 
you have to do 
by blade just a little bit and the referee will consider it a parrot 
i'm going again 
got a little already 
ok 
with the on the head 

because 
give me another carry on 
another one like this 

fear 
ok 
right so you have to clear ablaze and that takes our practice usually 
perry you clearly blade by doing a helicopter action and then making the cut helicopter arrived 
after the ferry and then the cod go again 
important 


too hard you try 
hard it's going to be difficult take 
from time to its slow 
sometimes depending on the type of stone and type a vessel that we're using you can actually use a burnished punch setting punch like these whichever the cup shaped interior are nice and smooth and you'll put it over the bezel and use a hammer to set the stone 
works well with smaller faceted stones and in situations where you're going to need to set a lot of vessels that stones but it definitely doesn't give you the really delicate feel that you have by hand setting it and it definitely doesn't work for irregularly shaped stone 
one of the other important things that you need to remember when using these is to make sure that your bezel space around them for the edge of the burnished punch to actually slide around when you hit it then probably the last most important thing is to make sure that you're setting is somewhere that's extremely solid because otherwise every time you hit it it's just going to bounce so it's important especially when using these to also make sure that your stone is perfectly cited in the setting because once you hit it chances are it will stay right where you put it so you want to use and nice from hit with a hammer such as a chasing hammer like this one and preferably if you're setting can be sitting on a metal surface or very firmly locked in a heavy vice you'll get the best results 
what we're going to discuss and go over its proper technique on how to inspect firefighters bunker pants or turn up pants 
one of the first things we want to do is visually inspect the material for any rips your tears are weak spots 
chemicals and ultraviolet light can damage the turnout clothing so by gently pulling and tugging at the same time visually inspecting the stitching to make sure nothing has come loose and there is no physical damage 
if we find any the gear should be sent out for repair or replacement should take place 
checking the knee pad area for any holes loose shredding that may have to be repaired 
beyond that we will check any hardware like zippers or any clips or fasteners to make sure they are all and good working order 
sippers snaps and then move on to the inner liner including the snaps that hold in the thermal barrier and the moisture barrier 
one way that we could check that moisture a thermal barrier is to hold it up to light and try to see through it or place and over something like a five gallon pale and pour water on to it to see if water will repel or not go through that thermal barrel barrier which tells us and still intact and in good shape 
well considered the suspenders part of the gear they should also be inspected to make sure their tight and improper working order 
so in this clip we're going to go ahead and make a pattern for our eye mask 
we already have an eye mask it's just a plain kind of boring when that i bought it a mass mark 
pet store so i'm just going to use this as a template but if you don't have a sleeping mass basically you want something that's an oval shape about i'd say this is about six inches wide 
we want to place cut out for your news so you basically make like along oval and then we're going to skip out of place 
with the news so i'm just going to bring this to my paper and then i'm going to go ahead and chase it 
we just go ahead and trace it can lift up the little nose guard part come back down 
doesn't have to be exact because we're going to clean it up when we cut it out 
i actually want mind to come down a little further so i'm just going to go ahead and freehand 
and what you do when you're actually free handing something is you go ahead and just folded in half and then we'll cut it out so that the other side is sexy 
and i remember when you are making patterns or cutting out patterns to have a separate scissors that you can use just for paper 
as you don't want to use a really good fabric scissors 
go ahead and see this as a little bit too straight so we just couldn't go ahead and clean that line up just a little can make it a little more just visual leo 
once you have your paper pattern they were ready to transfer this onto her fabric and actually cut it out 
segment we're going to talk about reflecting telescopes 
and our refractors first appeared on the scene in the early sixteen hundreds as astronomy progressed it became obvious that larger lenses were going to be needed to see those more distant objects 
problem was that larger glass was expensive and difficult to manufacture 
it was solved a little bit later when a guy named isaac newton invented a telescope with a concave mirror as opposed to a convex glass 
and here's where it cheaper less expensive to manufacture and you can make them and larger sizes 
so newtonian telescopes and hence the name are typically a little bit more cost effective for the light gathering ability 
will discuss the different type amounts here in just a moment 
one of the things you should know about a reflecting telescope is that the light comes in through the shield right here and bounces off a mirror backup into a secondary mirror up near the eyepiece that actually throws the light into the piece allowing you to view 
larger aperture telescopes such as as tenants right here can still be broken down rather quickly and easily and compact 
you can throw in the back of a small car and take out to a dark sky observing site 
starting with six to eight inches these are ideal for getting started with deep sky objects 
you starting a messy a list you want to see the more distant globular clusters are supernovas these are really the most cost effective way to get aperture 
we 're only for astronomy however 
we cannot use the scopes for daytime use 
if everything would be upside down and backwards have been disorientating to try to use 
next thing you need to know some of the tolzien you'll be used for when you're making your rates 
we use a wire cutter or the wire flowers that we're going to be using 
a needle nose pliers if you need to get in there and tighten up anything on to the race heavier gauge cutters for the thicker flowers 
you can get a non wrapped the floral tape gauge wire that you can buy it any craft store 
i also like to use oasis paper wrapped wire if you are using this make sure you pull it from the center so you can continue using it is not creates a big message you pull it out at the top 
whatever you prefer whether it be a glue gun with glue sticks or you can use a looming glue or some kind of floral glue 
can you could buy a hardware store 
i also like to make sure i have my old paintbrush around so that if i have any strings or anything to pull off 
a good pair of scissors are always half full from whenever you're cutting the bows as well as the different types of ruins you may want to use for and you're making your race 
these are the tools you need in order to make theories 
in the rocky level i showed a quarter gassy how to turn out of it just like this grabbing the wrist stepping out and putting the person and corrugated 
i'm going to show you a little bit different version that's going to connect with the things that we're going to do here and a little bit 
from stand behind me right here 
instead of doing that now i'm going to come out just like this 
just like i back out to the side that's the foetus forwards 
for my foot as forward here i stepped back that's all i do 
one too 
if your partner resist you grab tight 
and you'll find that they can get out they can't stop you from moving 
once i do this technique here i'm out of harm's way 
what i get to do is really up to me 
his hand up here is going to swoop down and grab the sadder risks 
and to do that a little bit slower 
here it's going to come in here and grab this risk as a ten call and as i turn just like here 
from there it looks a lot like milanesi quarter gassy 

one two three 

from here just like that 
blend with this come up underneath and turn him just like that are slow this down a little bit 
he comes blend with the attack hand comes up here spin around quarter gash 
sometimes abbreviate coda guess you've got a gash here 
applause 
one more time 
in this clip about performance art i'm going to talk about finding a venue 
so you've created your performance art piece 
it has a concept 
we use the senses its visual has no costumes what have you 
workshopped it 
what do you got grants 
it got a free piano the deal 
when you're going to perform it now 
well you could find a venue 
irregular venue at a concert 
hall a restaurant a club 
you could produce your own event 
we could do a night of performance artists 
other performers artists to share your gig 
so that you have more of a draw 
you could look into performance art festival 
on the computer 
can discern research and the internet 
and find proof festivals to submit your work too 
you could perform at a fundraiser 
fundraisers are always looking for free performers 
so there's benefits to doing your own into performing with others 
i would suggest always perform with others 
because the first time you perform it's pretty easy to get your twenty friends out 
but the second time the third time they stop coming 
and it's really good to share the event 
so find a space find a great venue and produce it with other people 
so this is the touch our lesson 
we're going to start the partnering 
christina haggerty 
miriam swapping zara and we're going to start 
we're going to just do the basic step first 
face each other so you can see how we relate to each other 
now miriam is going to change recession 
is actually going to be stepping back as i stepped forward 
it was going to look like this 
we're going to step one is still the transition to three chacha six seven eight and one two three four and five six seven eight and one 
so that's the church are basic 
facing each other 
so charge i could actually be danced in closed position or open position 
here here's what closed position looks like 
creative frame the leaders creative frame with their arm and the money to make your hand as big as you can and you're going to place it in the center of your partner's back 
other hand you're going to open the palm 
if she's going to place your palm and yours 
if she's going to actually rest her left him lightly on your shoulder and the arm contours your arm as well 
so this is closed position 
when i'm gonna go into that same basic step and closed position 
it looks like this one two three four and five six seven eight and one two three four and five six seven eight and one 
if you notice miriam is doing a little bit more some styling she's moving a lot more and myself being a leader i'm actually just taking the steps 
some doing less body movement keeping in very nice posture 
for the last position we're going to show you is open position 
we can again do the same step in what's called open position 
so again he was our basic one two three four and five six seven eight and one two three four and five six seven eight and one 
habit 
the basic steps 
we showed you closed position 
we can actually also down to without holding on at all and do some cha cha cha shines as well 
i am donna barns 
from a life and dating coach an owner of dating coach here in new york city 
in this clip or talk about how to find the best internet dating and well there's three of the big guys 
first one is match com and it definitely has i think believe they have fifteen million people 
you can search for free 
and you can say you're a woman looking for a man you could pick the age range you put in your zip code and just head on to see what all will give you 
so you can browse through profiles and look at pictures of people 
so you can create your own free proof profile before you even have to join so much dotcom is a pretty successful way of meeting people 
next there's a harmony dot com which goes bad at a little bit differently 
they give you a free compatibility test that to be almost takes a couple of hours to fill out but then they send you matches 
we don't have to look at matches yourself 
they tell you what's most compatible for you and then there's yahoo personals which again allows you to create a free profile and do searches without signing up and on both match and yahoo you have to sign up for a pay account before you can actually communicate with people 
this is donna barnes from new york city 
that we've opened to that we're gonna pull it 
so firstly want to compress the floor 
and you take one of your flat ribs and you just swooped down and push down on the bottom 
two things 
it makes it 's move and it also gives its strength 
clay needs to be compressed at every step of the way so that it won't crack 
it will be strong and from them 
and now i take my right hand and my thumb 
and i slide underneath the clay and get myself just a little undercut 
then i get it 
and i actually pinch the fingers of my left hand together 
arm is going to stay here 
but my hands go up 
and i'm going to use this hand underneath push and guide and compressed from the top at the same time 
and i'm pulling just a ring up and it should only take you just a couple of color it in 
cold calling it and just take both of your hand and push it in and it should only take you a couple of poles to get the shape the height that you're going for 
and there we have a cylinder 
said 
in this clip i'll be discussing the the importance of understanding how to live in a dorm ipod or a room setting in the prison system 
a lot of people have a miss concept about it they think that people are sitting on cots behind bars and quite usually that's not the case 
the county jail basically houses people in the forms of pods where they have several different rooms and side of the pods and you're living in a space that's extremely small without any storage 
once you get to the state institution level where the previously center level you may find yourself in a dorm style setting with rows upon rows of steel bunk beds and the only space that is actually yours is that that exists between the two your bed and the bed next to you and a lockbox that slides underneath the bottom bunk 
bad luck boxes usually about two and a half by one and a half feet and it's about a foot deep 
so you've got to figure out a way to confine your living and all of the things that you own or possess in a very small environment 
once you get to the pre release level you may be fortunate enough to stay in a room with only four or three other people for room for man room total 
under those circumstances you begin to realize that there are certain things you have to do in order to be comfortable and healthy as well 
cleanliness is an extra godliness and the prison system because you don't have a lot of space and because there was a lot of confinement you can find yourself subjects different infections and diseases illnesses that you may not necessarily come across so readily if you are out walking around in the streets every day 
but they do provide you with lots of cleaning supplies 
can keep your environment very clean it helps you it helps your roommates it helps the people around you and it keeps the piece to a very great level 
for small space that you're living and you've got to figure out different ways to do a different ways to manipulated so that you're not in violation of the rules of the institution or a violation of other people space and it's not an easy thing to do 
it has gone 
a couple of different games and i'm going to be showing you here 
in the next darts i actually learned a few years back from my brother who is an amazing dark player and we've been in a couple of competitions done really well 
so i'm going to show you exactly how to throw darts with expert accuracy 
i'm sure you everything that you're going to need to know about how to play the game and dark 
what all these numbers mean one of these rings mean i know that's a bull's eye but what does that mean 
ladies and gentlemen i'm john coker better known in the stages slow motion and i'm representing an emotion entertain 
for our next step we're going to add some little tricks and moves 
what i want you to think about is just something that you do on a normal day basis 
common your hair or or walking down the street or something like that 
walking down the street and i want you to see how happy can be incorporated 
i just wanted to get used to known as one chance in 
you can't just walking down the street 

in the summer here and we're going to do this 
welcome industry 
credit 
accounts and credit 
six said 
one 
one too 
so here we are on the other side of the room and it's just getting so exciting 
we have to wrap this up in the next couple of days 
tamara closet gets install we have my idea about the door still to execute with cutting it in half creating kind of a farmhouse store you'd think would be really cute if we can pull it off 
steps i'm going to leave in concrete we're going to clean them up and we're going to seal them and i think that would lend to that lofty kind of den like feeling 
you can see cypriot framed this 
we bumped out for the electrical box 
barcodes that we want to really be careful about not that i know them all but one for sure is that we maintain clear access to the electrical panel 
is the in the event of a fire or emergency situation where you have to flip your breakers you have a clear he grass to the box 
so we've created that here will have a door on this so that conceals in our switches are right here come around to our new little bay window which when things happen they don't go the way you plan like we had planned to bump this whole thing out two feet so now we've lost the actual floor two feet of it but i'm really excited because now we're going to be able to put patrick's desk here we're going to build this desk and for him 
and to say cost effective with it this will just get a piece of plywood over it and then i'm having the glasgow when he comes in measures for these little insert sidelight sometimes windows are called side lights or lights so that i could deceiving little technical term that threw me early on 
is going to have a nice glass top table and will extend it out ten inches so that his chair will fit under it and this will become his death 
choosing to do this and glass for two reasons 
first is i love that glass you can see right through it and it keeps the space expansive 
if you've got a small living room and a coffee table you put a big dark chunky coffee table in their rooms going to feel small 
if you put a lighter weight base and a glass top that room will stay more areas 
classes really good and in small spaces where we're looking to not you know we don't want to jam with furnishings 
so his desk chair will sit nicely in front of this will be a dance can be able to have all this light while he was working 
we should even appear to put a printer or any other little electronics that everyone seems to have these days 
and i think that it will be real easy to will pull our wires to wear earplugs over there and it will be good to go 
we should see a lot of progress by the end of the week 
both financing is something that we do offer as a dealership in marine industry 
is something you want to look into if you start looking for a cash purchase 
typically the loans anywhere from twenty five to fifty thousand dollars finance are going to offer you a fifteen year loan 
if you go from fifty to one hundred thousand hours off each one year alone 
if you go up from two hundred to three hundred thousand hours on earth they went off your third year 
if you go down from twenty five thousand dollars you gonna find anywhere from eight to twelve year alone 
the higher volume and price range you finance a longer term you're going to be able to go 
interest rates on a bow is definitely going to be a little higher than a car or a house in the reasons why that is because anytime you have something that you don't need are necessary like an automobile his ethnicity houses nasty rv a motorcycle their rates are little higher because it's something that you don't need every day 
typically with good credit nowadays we're finding customers getting you are from seven and a half to eight percent rate on financing 
today we're going to show how to hold a stick properly 
before even holding the stick you have to realize that there are many different kinds of sticks out there but some of the more common kinds are a traditional wooden stick and aluminum shaft this one happens to have separate blade so it's a two piece stick the one i'm using right now is a one piece graphite stick 
more of a personal preference but with today's technology a lot of people who have been using the graphite one piece sticks 
first thing you want to do is you want to make sure you get to the right level the right length of the stick 
so most common is when you're on your skates the top of the stick should be about at your chin 
if you're standing on your feet it should be about your nose 
and that's that's how you pretty much get an average length 
also depending on what position you play if you're a forward they tend to have the stick length a little bit shorter whereas defenseman tend to have their state quake a little bit longer but like i said it's more of a personal preference 
in this segment we're going to talk about some basic foot brushes and how to do passes with a foot brush 
before we talked about how to do a foot brush back to yourself and the basic food brush can also be done as a pass and all you need to do is just adjust the angle a little bit so the first a little flatter so when you kick it it's not going to come back to you but it's actually going to go to your partner so we're going to try a couple of kicked passes now with clockwise spin 
some spin 
have you noticed she wanted to try to put more spin on it when you do that kick pass 
is here 
drop down both then ryan could go into a bunch of different combinations from there 
it can also do your other foot 
splendid here in kicker with the other foot 
spin it here and kick it with the other foot 
it 's a kick pass 
it's a great way to passersby to your partner 
in our progression through our one leg functional lower body training exercises this exercise is the hardest 
i learned this exercise it was called the pistol 
other people known as the one legged squats 
either way it's an exercise that demands a lot of balance and a significant amount of string 
and after you've gone through those other progressions leading up to this and you've made sure that you're able to do it you can try this 
in this exercise basics one likes going to be off the ground that's why it's a one they exercise 
going to reach forward as hard as you can while you're going down and this is what it's going to what it's going to look like 
it 's easier for me to show you than it is to explain 
go down so you balance is very required on this you want to grab your foot you can 
but that's the bottom position and then you come up 
again i'll just show you another one 
up and one more 
important points during that 
first of all if you have really poor hamstring flexibility you may not be able to go down like that and keep your leg up at the height it needs to be 
another thing is when you go down always important on any lower body exercise is the knee or going down with has to stay in line with the foot 
we don't want your knee going out 
what 's more likely on pistols is your knee or bucklin when you start being tired 
highly suggests you stop before that starts happening too much 
all that does is put a lot of strain on the inside of your knee 
again pistols full depth one legged squats 
it 's not a full pistol if you're hamstring doesn't touch your care 
but again reaching forward for balance 
if you don't reach forward you will not make it down you'd have to counterbalance nearby 
see when we're in the bottom position we've got a lot of weight on the backside so we've got to reach forward so we can counter balance and then we come up 
that 's one rep you can do those when you're starting out you may want to alternate legs do one left one right and keep switching so you get some rest in between 
go ahead and give those try 
if that's all the leg exercises we have for a day 
a lot for joining me 
dr garrett smith of dr as teacher dot com 
if you want to learn more about these exercises and find someone who's trained in them you'll want to look to cross fit dot com and find a local affiliate in your area 
thanks again for joining us 
we're going to talk about an advanced street technique which is learning how ali fake or rolling backwards 
learning how to ali fake he is the natural next step after learning how to ali and learning how to roll fake 
combine the two to pull off this pretty advanced trip 
start by rolling backwards pop the ali as you normally would bring your front foot up to level out and roll away 
a major difference between doing a regular front ali and a funky ali as that when doing the funky ali you have to push your front foot further up and faster to compensate for the momentum of the board in order to level it out and roll away 
see when an action 
latin words pop and land 
usually when performing this trick i like to keep my focal point on the street as unrolling backwards on the nose as an alien and back to the street when i lane 
see it one more time 
the pop the ali then amazingly 
with enough speed learning how to fahy ali can lead you into learning how to do more advanced fake you flip tricks 
so you have the canker sore 
while many and michelle and i am going to explain to you on how you can avoid getting canker sores 
the main reason how canker sore starts to become in your mouth is from stress 
when i went to college and i was studying for a final exam and i was all stressed out my mouth lit break out in horrible canker sores 
very large and it was never fun 
so one of the ways is to avoid that is just really not stress yourself out 
and then another way is canker sores started to come in your mouth is from vitamin deficiency 
we really want to make sure that you continue taking a multi vitamins 
which and return would reduce any canker sores 
and also to there are certain food products out there that can promote canker sores in your mouth 
as far as eating excessive amount of peanuts or salt or any kind of acid type products 
that promotes a lot of canker sores 
but also to whenever you go to your general dentist and he is doing his exam with they explore and poking around sometimes you might leave and the next day you get a canker sore 
that's normal 
what you would want to do is just rinse your mouth out with some warm saltwater rents 
that will help soothe the area 
the salt will eat away at the canker sore which and return it will disappear within a few days 
once again williams michelle and i just explain to you on how to prevent and treat canker sores 
richard games were here and marie utah we're talking about basic car care 
and right now i'm going to tell you how to change your headlights 
first of all in this particular type of car and our cars are different but a lot of the newer ones have this fixed headlights molded headlights 
in order to remove this there's a couple of screws that you have to remove up on top 
so we've got the screws out and be careful not to drop them anywhere because they're really hard to find 
and now we're going to try to pull us out of this is your turn signal bulb clear you twisted and then you pull it out and then you can pull that bob out and put the new went in 
if you put it back in line up the the little tab share their three tabs you line them up on the socket and then twisted back into place 
the headlights it's a little bit different twist that and they all come with some kind of a twist mechanism and then once you get that twisted off by lining up the calves with the halls then you can just pull that out 
you want to be really careful on these light bulbs that you don't touch the actual glass 
if you touch the glass with your fingers it will corrode the glass and will cause problems with the light it won't last long 
so when you remove that you should probably use a cloth or something or or gloves and remove the bulb and put the new one in 
in this clip we're going to talk about and maintenance for these birds 
so basic maintenance obviously food and water 
the other maintenance is these guys get a little bit bored so you might want to switch out their toys 
they should have decent amount of distractible toys in their cage that they can destroy and like sift through so obviously anything distractible toy needs to be replaced as it becomes destroyed 
and these guys also to maintain their feathers quality need either be misted on a daily basis or by a daily basis if he can with a small mr 
can also offer these birds a lot of them love to take baths you can offer them a very shallow bowl of water 
put it at the bottom of the cage and these birds will jump in and take a little bath and fluff than the water up over their feathers and let it run down their back 
water helps remove any shit and stuff that might be in your household that is accumulating any sort of dust 
basically keeps their feathers clean 
also compared to their environment our homes with air conditioning and heat i'm tend to be extra dry and still a lot of times they'll have trouble molting their feathers properly can end up with some damaged feathers if they don't have a high enough humidity 
again if you miss them a couple of times a day this can help compensate for the low humidity in your home and keeping good feather health for these guys 
basic other stuff that these guys need is generally recommended that once a year you take them to event 
that can hold them still and like look underneath their feathers and check underneath their wings 
open up their mouths and look into their eyes and make sure that there isn't the beginnings of any serious health problems which is difficult for the average owner to do 
sometimes these guys need to have their nails trimmed as their nails will get overgrown 
if you take your bird out of the cage we consider taking it outside you need to be decide whether or not you want a cliff these guys wings 
it can be fun to have a bird that can fly all over your house in coming goes it please but it can also be very dangerous for the bird 
so you may have to clip your birds wings every twelve weeks to every six months depending upon where and half and your british molting 
and the other basic things is just a cage maintenance you want to make sure there are any loose strings are things 
check your cage out make sure there's anything that could get wrapped around a leg sometimes these guys will be playing in their toys and get this piece of string wrapped around a toe or leg and cut off circulation 
you need to clean out their cage i recommend cleaning it out at least every other day 
put down a newspaper than clean it up 
but at least you can tell if your birds been eating and that all of its stools look normal 
there are not too bad as far as just day to day maintenance you need to consider 
especially if you've only got one bird that you spend at least a couple of hours a day 
it 's sort of a more intimate time with your bertie they're sitting next to their cage in talking to them or having them out with you 
if they've got other birds that they can interact with you don't have to spend as much one on one time you just gotta make sure they're the environment that they live in a safe said 
i'll talk about which notes are most important in a cord 
before we start building cords with extra tensions on them 
so let's look back at our major scale here 
seven notes of a major scale 
now primarily the first thing you look at his is the cord major or minor 
that has to do with the three 
even before that the route note is the letter name that you're going to see that starts off the court 
so if you had c c minor seven flat five court 
see that's going to be your starting point 
minor that tells you whether the cords major or minor 
so three is very important 
the seven will tell you it's either if it's a minor seven it's a flat seven if it's a regular seven just the number seven it's a flat seven 
it 's a major seven then you're going to have a natural seven here 
now as far as five goes if you haven't minor seven flat five this becomes important but unless the five as stated in the cord 
if it's diminished or if it's flat five the most important notes that you're going to need or the one three and seven 
oftentimes you can leave the five out and you still retain the quality of the cord just by having the one three and seven especially the three and seven 
and i'm going to be talking about different gift ideas for a coworker 
gift to get your coworker would be actually just to buy them lunch or dinner 
could place a little certificate on their desk or even a coupon now the way that you could give this give them the spray male would be to place a coupon or certificate on the desk saying you can redeem this coupon any day that you like for lunch or dinner for you can even place a date on their just making as creative as you can 
but make sure that if you have a little crush on this person that they want reject you or if they think you're coming onto your anything just make sure you make it clear that just your christmas present to them 
michael bearing with my brain films data org located in salt lake city utah and we're talking about using microsoft windows 
but i want to talk to you now about is how to adjust the date and time on your computer system 
for me start by saying that windows xp as a registered trademark of microsoft and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft 
suggested aid in town on your computer system is very simple 
it 's important especially because i've had times when her when i've had the wrong time on my computer system because they chose the wrong time zone or something and i'm always going off that clogged and end up being laid to an appointment with them 
the best way to change the time is to scrawl under the right hand corner 
if you look down on the right hand corner of your desktop it gives you the time and if you mouse over that like i've done it will show you the current it'll show you the current date 
if you click on this if you double click on this it will open up your date and time properties 
greenland 's down to the center of the screen 
is showing exactly what time it is where i'm located in utah the date and this is how you change it 
for example here's the drop down menu for months you can change to what your current month is if this happens to be off this is heaven forbid month month of august 
pleasure drop down lists for the ears you can change the year and here you are just click on the date on the calendar of what data this to to get that current 
it has three times a day in time time zone an internet time 
when you click on the time zone tab this gives you the chance to choose your time zone ran our in the mountain time zone and i've already clicked went down here automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes that way you don't have to keep up with 
this way my clock was always an hour off 
because they never checked that 
the third appears your internet time this is going to synchronize your clock with certain websites 
unlike here's a website timed out windows dotcom if you click the update now button it will automatically update your date and time for you so that you don't want to do it manually 
that 's just a quick shortcut to do it but usually i know date and time anyway 
it 's pretty much the simplest way to do that that's important because it with all of your computer your your automatic your savings and you're on your or your savings in near your files were all saved by date and time and if this is not accurate than it can be hard to do system restores or to restore certain deleted files if you're dating times are off 
can we talk about why it's important to combine these groups and to know into practice all of them 
because on the drums you'll find that they all have their advantages 
for me my preference is traditional but i still work on all of them just because i know it's going to make the world a more well rounded drummer made easier and have more options available to me 
for instance in traditional here like this he time ago to this side of the drum set a pretty much switched to fringe group 
it really helps with the ride technique 
so as i am going around the drum set and trying to use the natural bounce of the drum and the stick without playing in the drone but actually play a little bit off the drum 
when the drum and the symbols and everything help me 
so if i'm going around a drum kit notice as i went this way my grip started to change with my right 
in the uk and back to this 
same thing as i was talking about between the rise in the snare drum 
all this really helps out as far as carrying it over rather than twisting your body and losing your balance and for me it just gets me they're a little quicker 
so that's how i really do feel combined these groups can help 
beginning on the tenth fret tuesday and then the third and fourth fingers on the fred and second finger on the g on the eleventh fret and of course barring the last two 
and that's your d major chord 
and that's how it sounds in this position 
moving down to the threat on the stirring as day and then barring with your pinkie or your ring finger the dg and be strings on the seventh fred 
again it's been preferable to the other serves a little more difficult to make that shape but on either shape you want to keep your thumb in the middle of the back of the neck securing your first fenger to properly execute the bar 
and that is your d major bar cord 
travis at mad dog cycles heron provo we're talking about how to put a bike hook in your garage like this to hang your bicycles up on the ceiling 
first you want to get lilies hooks most bike shops do carry these 
can find him that your local mass merchant hardware stores they're very inexpensive like a dollar ninety nine each 
and as you can see we have raptors showing here some garages will be sheet rocks you want to make sure you hit the appropriate stead 
when you see how we put this when i hear into the star skirted in there and we space to not just enough to where if you were to put it on a lot of bikes like we do here you have one going up in the other hand bars going down seeing squeeze a lot more together that way 
a little bit harder if he if you have fewer bikes would be better to space it out just enough 
also you can actually mounties hooks on the wall and then hang the bike down in case you have really really tall ceilings and if you do have tall ceilings we have wastes systems that you can get to 
coming off your forearm and between your wrist and your elbow 
make sure your platform is set and make sure you are facing your target where you want to put the ball over the net 
and also follow through to where you are putting the ball over to the net 
if you want to go deep for bumps shot you want to get low and push the boat out push the boat out a little bit but if you wanted to go ashore his show want to get low and push it up a little bit to make it a shorter bumps shot over the net 
competition is one thing you can use to fix your bum shy and volleyball and it really helps to to work on airline to practice in a lot to get your bumps shot consistent so you can get over the net and that is how to fix your bum shot and volleyball 
high we're going to work on body cannot anna bound angle 
and it is the sanskrit named for bound angle 
so we're going to start as we are here sitting up nice and talent any comfortable position that fits your body 
and then we're just going to open up your feet and connect the soles of your feet and will start plugging in the bone so you want to be able to have a firm foundation 
working on the soles of your feet you can peel the feet open somewhat which will help you lengthening from the inner growing to the knee grounding the baby toe 
we want to work on getting some lift and length in your spine and we're going to do that out the crown of your head relaxing the shoulders away from your ears 
as you begin to peel open you can use your elbows to open your elbows 
post begins to open up your groin preparing for your other poses but it's also poles were in with beginners you'll feel some discomfort in your ticket blocks right here or your blankets and just bend your knees up more is going to make a body just a little bit more comfortable trying to get the heels is close to the groins as we can and then just begin to settle into the pose 
another form of artifacts oral communication is your clothing 
what you were gifts a very strong impression of who you are 
white me i like red sweaters 
my red sweater almost every day 
a big part of who i am 
everybody has a different style 
maybe your style is more formal 
maybe it's more casual 
maybe you have a very bohemian style where you dress very eclectic 
neither is good or bad it simply is a non verbal expression of who you are 
the only thing that you want to consider when it comes to clothing is are there certain times where you need to all to her that expression 
for example when i teach at college class i always bring this up to my students 
tend to dress a little more conservatively 
i asked my students on the first day of class when i walked in the door what was your impression on me 
they rattle off all these complimentary things of course because they all want a's 
but then we say to them what would you have thought if i had walked through the door in a tank top and cut off shorts 
and there are only shot because they wouldn't quite know what to think of that 
but it would give them an entirely different impression of me because i say to them what would you think of me as a professor if i did that 
the answers are always completely different than what the initial perception was because of the way i dress 
dress is non verbal and it's just something to consider again based on whatever situation she might be going into 
so hopefully now that you know how to do different words we've putting it all together into the backwards we will be a snap 
let 's start by slow time circles just like we did before and we're going to try one continuous cycle and then going back to split times circles 
starting with my right arm 
one hole wave and then back 
so again each hand gets a chance to be on top 
by risks are moving under each other as they cross 
wonder 
watch how the wrist comes around my hand and under the other one 
this will enable you to do it without your ploy crossing and tangling with one another 
few get confused just come back to split times circles and try again starting with your right hand leading up to your left shoulder and around 
think of them going under the other one 
under 
a job 
you can always go to your linen closet and grab a bath towel grout a hand towel and you'll be good to go 
so you want to grab your towel about shoulder width apart pull on both ends of the town and you're going to lift your arms straight up in front of you just to about shoulder height and want to make sure that your wrists are nice and straight with your knees make sure their soft and their bent nicely and lower your arms down lift up and lower down again think about pulling on the town angering caging though shoulders and as your breathing exhale at inhale as you lower down 
never forget to work your abdominal muscles keep them in nice and height 
perform about a minute of this exercise and then rest and that is your friend showed arrays 
so now the eyes are completely done and they look fantastic 
with the finishing touches the lips 
the signature point of this luck is armed with the old hollywood starlet it was normally like that read that really like madonna read but with the flapper luck it was that more dark glossy shiny so we're going to combine the two and do like a burgundy shimmery glossy 
pay lip someone i started out with a burgundy lip liner 
and she's that nice full lips so i'm not going to overdraw her lips i'm just going to trace her natural lip line and just kind of fill it in with the lips the lip liner by a little bit 
this is where you can create a nice shape for your lips like that rosebud lips or if you like those pointed lives it's just completely up to you 
if she has a great natural lip lines so i'm just going to trace that completely 
and again filament because you don't want to see the lip liner 
wanted to all natural and blended 
and also filling in your lives to the lip liner will help keep your lipstick on longer it will prevent from bleeding 
being a lot of benefits to using a little bit of a lip liner 
and again said very neutral you don't want to look like a harsh lip line just basically shaping the lips 
for an hour and start with the lipstick 
so now i'm ready to go ahead and extrude the handles for the garlic jar 
the first thing i've done is i've brought a board over here so that i have a place to lay my extruded handles that's portable 
now before you put the clay into the extruders you want to check and make sure that your dies lined up properly so that you don't have any edges of your form getting cut off 
the plunger out of the way drop your cylinder of clay and the exterior names off the in 
the first couple of times you move this plunger nothing's gonna come out 
it 's just the clay conforming to the shape of the barrel 
but then once it does start coming out you just want to push very slowly 
that was an air bubble 
then bring the bottom of the clay 
you can see that this portion right here that's where the air bubble popped out 
as sometimes happens 
we 're just going to need to cut that right there and use from here over 
and you want to go ahead and extrude everything that's in the cylinder out 
it makes more sense 
even if you're not going to use all the handles right now you can cover them in plastic and save them for another project later 
just keep them on your board 
where did i get started on how do we bring this horse up tire up and get ready for a fun day of western events 
i want to be sure i'm leading my horse in the same fashion that you would walk side by side may be holding hands with a partner 
i'm going to hold the extra length of leader open my left hand held in a way that it could never wrap around my hand on my wrist 
in my right hand is going to be that guiding hand that stays close up into the horses halter but still on the rope area 
i 'm going to walk next tour looking ahead to where i'm going keeping her side by side 
or write a period of the secure rail world then attach her with a safety net 
by safety not begins by putting that length of rain over the back making sure she's on an eighteen inch length we don't want her to be able to get her head down that road caught up maybe between her legs 
i like to think of it as a safety not i have to go all the way around a complete twist 
so i look at it and i've got a piece of the leader of twisted around each other then i bring up one end to create that looper circle pull a piece of the lung leader of through so it's a loop and then i've got this longer piece that i can keep aside 
if this horse word ever get into a situation that caused her to do what some horses might pull back i'm going to be able to release her from a safe distance and perhaps even on the other side of this rail so i'm not anywhere near where it could become flailing hooves if she were scared enough 
we always say though don't ever sacrifice yourself for the safety of the horse 
if she gets herself into a position that's unsafe for her letter stop and figure it out 
we don't want to jump in there and put yourself at risk as she tries to figure out how to get away from the tether that's made her so scared 
while everybody on john grain from the martial arts teachers association and john graden dotcom 
is the front kick on the shield there's a couple of thought 
part of me from post are mixed martial arts my good friend mr joe renewal 
when he is holding the shield i liked him to be fighting stance face in me and he's going to have a conscience 
wonderfully face in his solar plexus way because a good kick go right through the hidden so plex 
we turned sideways just a tad lincoln absorbed and was a little bit better 
and also i want him to exhale when i hit it again making sure he does it at the wind knocked out of him so let's take a look at frankly on the shield 
for posture of frantic as you know because you watch all my clips we do it and for what 
once can lead to fold pulling the nearby to is the actual extension 
when i extend this front kick i'm going to hit with a ball of the foot 
notice that the foot is poetry but the toes of pull back and out of the way 
we 're not going to reform the kick very quickly so does get caught in the up and then from there i will sit back down to my father stance 
as i throw the kick two important things 
when a breather gives it more power that can wait you exhale to thrust my hips which gives me additional power 
so not just kicking with my leg i want to get as much of my body weight behind that as possible so from here i'm and a good garden since there is a tendency to rush the kit 
make sure you take the time to fold correctly fold high and fold tight striving straight through 
there you go 
fried chicken on the shia with job renewal 
thank you john grin 
my name is day rangers 
damn well turn tell you how to turn off counter miners and microsoft outlook 
begin by robbing outlook by clicking on the start button at the bottom 
our programs and microsoft office outlook 
were in outlook let's go to tools options and on the default reminder checkbox under calendar it's bad fall it's check with a reminder fifteen minutes 
forest uncheck it and that turns out the default reminder to be said for all new calendar entries 
apply 
it 's open up our calendar he created a new item today at eleven o'clock 
notice that the reminder of the top is set to none 
since we take that checkbox they will all be none from now on 
as you can see it's very easy to turn off counter reminders and microsoft outlook 
by name is dave andrews and i've just showed you how to turn off counter reminders and microsoft outlook 
in this clip i want to talk to you about freestyle motocross 
freestyle motocross really can put in itself on the map 
it used to be just kind of a lot of free riding out in the hills maybe i'll in california boma a lot of places like that 
guys just sit and dirt jumps 
these days it's coming into the stadiums in the x games to gravity games the mountain dew tour 
the entire series 
so as long as just a motocross and the supercar series they also have freestyle actual series 
we can catch him on tv all the time 
need adams travis pastrana and kenny bartram these guys they're all just been instrumental in the motor crossing 
back in one thousand nine hundred and nine when carrie heart flew his first backflip in new york at the gravity games that was just a huge moment for motor crossing 
you got guys they travel to china is doing double back flips and variations into their flips and a lot of really cool stuff coming from 
and across kind of different way to set up your bike for free style 
bike ride bikes brisk primarily motocross but a lot of guys they cut down their seats 
make their seat phones really thin because they're not going to you know they're not needed to do the model 
are not needed that cushion that seat to go faster on those corners and they've got a lot of big like say handholds back here and they're kind of their suspension might tend to be really stiff because they i mean they're on average jump in about one hundred foot plus jumps 
so you really going to want to absorb those landings and their bikes are completely set up for that 
maybe a little taller bars 
cross pads because they're doing a lot a lot of in and out and put their feet up here all the time 
we don't want to be getting hung up on anything like that 
and a lot of events are really getting pretty big 
so that's also the cool thing is that a lot of media coverage from this sport 
so take a look online you know there's a lot a lot of a freestyle events national and more local pride near you 
come check it out and that stuff 
i can't personally do a lot of the tricks that they can do on their but it's really exciting to see in person 
an important part of a dog guide responsibility is to guide the person around good boy numbers to guide the person around stationary obstacles and pedestrians as well 
so here we can see mambo avoiding the stationary obstacles but also a pedestrian 
he stops avoids the pedestrian and then carries on his plate 
and this is really important part in the dogs work that they avoid everyday hazards not just stationary ones but pedestrians pushchairs strollers anything that might be involved as you're walking down the high street 
dogs are trained to have a high level of initiative and as part of that finding doors shops is very very important than you own 
here we see my vote finding the door for greg 
what we do we train that by repeating the exercise and then given the dog loads and loads of reward 
once actually is successful so reward and repetition is the key what's really vital because in everyday life everybody wants to do their shopping everybody wants to go to the bank everybody wants to go visit their friends or the store and a dog can really benefit someone by finding those destinations on a daily basis 
so you don't have to be worried or stressed out about the fact that you've missed the door or you don't know which store going into which shut me going 
the dog will do that for you 
again by repetition and reward 
during exercise finding door and then giving the dog back surprise packs of encouragement 
people would come in here and generally they can be young and old because they need a tux or a suit even for special occasion 
i rent them and i would then to young people if you're younger you are usually go into a pram 
proms i give a special discounts because i believe and cradle to grave and i am hoping and it has happened has been proven that people will then recommend me for their other events and when the young man chooses to get married or something they will come here for their additional taxes be them the google moran and grooms 
i would then give them a book to select from 
and now i use a vendor and he has many of the up the date styles 
and the reason that you would rank attacks over perhaps buying them is that if you do not have them for any use them very often and you do not own one or have won a you would then have eventually a david tux 
they are somewhat traditional bought if you want the latest and the newest which most people do want when they want this for their special occasion they would come in here and find it easier to rental tops and they would fit them for me 
sometimes you know if you have your own you may change shape of them and they do not have to be re cleaned when you're finished as it was your own talk 
would then have to have claimed again 
hello my name is mark locker 
string theory is we're going to cover automotive tire change 
referring to tire change used for on traction devices for driving in deep snow ice or just general its poor weather conditions or window required by law 
basically there are two different types of changes that are out in available 
he kind of fall there's a lot of different variations but the kind of fall into brackets of cable chains and standard changing 
which is like a standard toe chain to style length in a cable chain beings of light aircraft gray and cable rather chain components 
it will go over those two different types and how to install profit the chains and some basic driving tips for our operating the change for operating the vehicle safely when the change or on it 
both cobra pre fitting and the actual putting the change on if you were in inclement weather situation 
so please watch our first segment will cover the different types are no change and go through their uses and applications 
my name is james computer hardware training coordinator for air connections 
i started using external monitor your laptop 
finally got to do is take your plouffe reminder of each year a plug 
we find the corresponding port on your laptop plug in audience might want to secure 
now your computer should recognize here the monterey hopefully have a picture up on your screen 
all laptops are a little different so you might want to go into your display settings and play around a little bit to change your resolution on either one of the two screens 
one thing to keep in mind as of two different settings and windows for these monitors 
one is a cloned your display so that everything you see on your display on your laptop is exactly the same as on the monitor 
the other is that extends so it uses it like a secondary mom 
click and drag something from one display over to another 
thus expanding the field of view you have with the desktop 
my name is james computer hardware training coordinator for interconnection and i just showed you had to install external mondor on your laptop 
an important trick to learn when to juggling three clubs it's called over the top 
very similar to the ball version but with clubs you have to worry about the spin 
so to get a club to travel from the outside of this hand to the outside of this and the more complicated than doing it with the ball 
with all you can just do a normal throw over the top 
with a club we have to do is turn to throw sideways that will spin like this over two other hand 
for sure what that looks like over the top with a club if you see my throws like this are in a plane traveling out for me like this spinning this way 
over the top is in a play ninety degrees from that and spinning like that something like that so i put that into the powder again just like that 
others throws a little complicated at first 
we have to think about turning your risk to the outside and then throwing over 
and make this work where we're going to do is just practice with one club 
it would be like this 
will have your normal throwing stance 
going to turn near club out ninety degrees then you're going to flicker out to the side you only want to spend once and that as is coming down like this need to catch ninety degrees out again with your left hand like that 
and you need to get this throw clean with both hands so that you can do go over the top pattern with either head 
something like this 
so takes quite a bit of practice or if you work on it long enough you can work it into your pattern 
it 's a very good visual effect people like outlooks over the sauce with three clubs 
it's called a whiskey separately 
otherwise it'll just be really big shot glasses 
we don't want to do that 
we want to kick it to sip are whiskey 

movies and thin 
see if i can get a couple out of here 
flipping it over making sure that both sides are about the same thickness 
applause 
for the next thing i have talked to you about is about having fun breathing and enjoying her day 
when learning how to dance make sure you just make small goals for yourself 
make a big goal so that we get discouraged 
first make many goals for yourself learned a move really practice certainly we take a week or two or however long it takes to learn that with a perfect fit 
we want to enjoy this dance for years to come 
serve as a learning process for years and years and years just enjoy 
it 's your dance they will be uniquely yours in the end 
make sure you make tiny goals for yourself and don't be discouraged 
they have that you should love 
when you love this dance and you dance and perform for others and it comes from your heart from inside the passion will show up everybody else 
in your damn thing whether you're a novice era your professional it will still show 
so just learn to love yourself love your dance and just be patient with yourself when you're learning how to belly dance 
nothing to do with the conscience of your breathing 
make sure your breathing when you're dancing and learning 
will help keep you healthy while you're dancing 
keeping the fence this will help prevent any injuries teenage and just enjoy yourself 
from the bbc circus right here in hollywood florida and this is juggling for the weekend 
so you want to learn how to juggle 
no problem 
it 's quite easy 
if anybody with a little technique perhaps someone who works with the tennis baseball or drummey would be very easy but absolutely anybody could learn 
some simple thoughts and ideas aren't yet 
struggling to simply more objects than you have hands 
when you have two hands it would be three or more objects 
with only one hand it would be two or more objects 
well let's start with something really simple 
figure eight like that 
in fact the figure eight from juggling his mathematical symbol for infinity in mathematics 
that means if you never catch two in one hand you will juggle forever because it's an endless process 
jump right into juggling 
be ready for some 
jason format genius and today i'm going to show you a quick and easy way to make a disc image 
which is also good for backing up your system and its macintoshes native kind of compression packaging for files 
and we're going to do is start off of disk utility 
so let's go into our hard drive because disk utility is not actually and your doc when you started 
so you need to add it to your doctor 
and i'm going to make this kind of easy to navigate 
go into our applications scroll down into our utilities and go to disk utility and we're gonna launch that 
if you want to drag something to your doc what you can do is if he dragged the xl application to your doc it'll make space for down here 
and if you want to take it out of your doc you just drag it out and hold it like that and it will delete 
so we're gonna launch this by not dragged into our dog 
and then when they're down here click and hold on it and say keep and doctors can access this in the future 
so up here where we do all of the onboard macintosh kind of first lady race rate and restore repair your permissions and stuff 
we're going to do is we're going to click so there's nothing selected and we're going to click on the image link up here 
and what that does is it's going to make a nudist image so we're gonna nameless this bridge 
and you can allocate the size you want this disc image to be or it's also proportionate to the media you want as well 
korean say five hundred megabytes encryption you can encrypt as if you wish so you also have sparse disk image here which you can utilize to reinstall your system if you've you've saved your system through it is creating it through a disc image 
so i'm going to save this and i'm just going to save us on the desktop 
quick way to get to the desktop is also to hit man d on the keyboard 
we can see this change to desktop right there and there's a little community signal 
symbol sorry 
so we're going to create the new disc image and because we encrypted it can ask for a password into verify the past 
and that's your system admin password the created 
and it's saying this because we didn't put in an admin password 
jason format genius and that's able to do this image in the west 
i stand 
we do our glamour girl bookmark will need some feathers a nice for me circles to the face an assortment of sequins and pretty things and some googly eyes 
so we'll start by drawing the face 
i'm going to show you a little trick on how to make this little cute little mouth on the girl 
if you make a very tiny m like this and then just draw a little smile under it and then fill in any white spots 
and get a cute little lips on your girl and then we'll just make a little l nose 
before i put my googly eyes on i want to put some wire hair 
and i've cut a little piece of wire pretty long because we're going to curl it and you can poke a hole with a pen into the phone 
is a paint brush and you just hold on to it and then wrap the wire around the paint brush my hair and then you can arrange the hair any way you want 
all right so let's go ahead 
while breakdowns for israel quick and will play together 
so you have what's what's exactly happening is you have on beats you have your four beats and the bar right 
beat one two three and four 
first you have to eighth notes 
both of these eighth notes are going to be squeezed within the first be ok 
eighth notes you heard are like we've been doing that's evenly dividing the beat 
if you just have to eighth notes feet one it sounds like this or want to three core 
closer to eighth notes and associates 
notes it's based on the same concept 
squeezing and sixteen instead of eight so 
first the number of notes in the bar 
instead of eighth notes in the bar have sixteen sixteen notes in the bar just relative to the length of of each of these notes i'll show you 
where have we have 
are a sixteenth notes on beats two and four okay so 
is what it sounds like just don't be too said 
with one too 
the core on one all right 
sorry 
for notes in their money and the weekend 
one a and this 
we divide in her head 
if you will 
and you don't want to count along and say this yourself as we're playing all right so 
so let's go 
ahead and do just the first two meters fuzzy together 
in this segment we're going to talk about how to move your arms while doing the roger rabbit 
and now you're going to have me kith and you're going to go backwards within flowing through and push back to make both the shoulder blade touching that he could do it from your cif or if the lower by a wave and push in and out but backward 
so the shoulder blades touch or let me say that again than a heavy armor turgid chairs pushing backward so your shoulder blades touch you could do these two different ways whatever comfortable for you 
by cif are lower by a wave and make sure your shoulder blades touch bed 
now i'm looking at our tax there's also the tracks and the mixer each track 
within these tracks and mixer gray would affect different things you can turn on the record brian you could also mute things you can turn on you will also saw things and turn on any type of automation you can own record actual changes in the volume or changes in different parameters free shrank as far as divine and the painting 
also go to your ear mixer and change the painting from left to right with his diary here as well as the volume 
this is going to be basically help you like to even out your check and as well as panted out so you can create more space between your instruments and make it more alive mix 
this mixture and tracks can be closed and opened and you can just press the prairie here this little triangle to close the mixer opening 
you can also go to your track and so track and fell are high the check in 
as a lot of different things you do within this track one that was to open in high different things 
now this is going to be really up to your coach and your captains to decide this but you have to figure out a place where your whole squad and stay comfortably while you're at your competition 
most competitions are going to designate one or two hotels as the premier place to save for the competition 
is going to be really great because you're going to be staying in a hotel that's filled with other cheerleading squads 
going to be awesome because you're going to meet people from all over the place who have similar interests as you and are going through the same experience 
so it's going to be really fun it's also important to taken factor things that are around your hotel 
when you're at competition there sometimes free time the day after or the day before if you stay somewhere where there's an amusement park around 
sometimes he can fit in your budget to go do fun things like that as a squad wired 
but it's also important to think about food because as a squad you're going to have definitely have to go out to eat together 
it 's important that you pack steph for the ride their in while you're there you really want to pack healthy snacks are going to give you lots of energy while you're running around and cheering 
fruit in power bars are really good way to go make sure you definitely bring lots of water with users hydration is key 
also had to go and call ahead at certain restaurants to see if you can set up some discounts or deals 
a lot of swans find that a buffet style is a great way to go because everybody can eat what they like and usually you can get it for a fixed price 
and unemployed college basketball because i'm behind 
college basketball because i could do this 
sounds good 
they will go overshooting automaker proper shots defense 
we gotta have defense wins championships and obviously to win championships you've got to have often 
over all those little techniques 
we assume that you already know how to play basketball the basic level so that's why i'm here to teach you how to adventure game to make a shooting dribbling passing in defence better so when you get on the court where you will make and last shots and go home winter

i have this other overgrown houseplant 
it was reported about three years ago 
can see that the plant it's almost as tall as me 
in a very tiny plot which creates some problems 
as the leaves are starting to bend over starting to grow out of the pie 
it dries out a lot so this 
this plant really needs to be in a pot that's more appropriate to its size 
i think once we bump it up again it's gonna really take off 
we could cut it back but i mean the fleas are really pretty 
if i cut back the leaves off it that's permanent 
it's not going to really regrow from the sleeve 
so i don't want to cut it back 
i think we're gonna pop this one out 
and here's the root system to the fence bavaria 
we can see that things are getting a very fine root system but things are getting a little tight 
so you can see this big but this would sprout out again if i gave it some room 
all these plants the sun up these roots and get it to some place now 
when near starting a new sport and it's important to know a little bit about the history of the game 
across started known as the only truly american sport because it was created by the native americans 
it started out on the eastern coast many many years ago and it's still a very popular sport over there 
it's actually maryland state sport and now it's kind of spread across the united states 
fares lots of college teams and lots of high school teams and there's even youth teams for like in your hair is an elementary school aged children 
today we're going to be talking about women's lacrosse but there is a difference between men and men's and women's lacrosse 
they have different rules 
they have different regulations for their sticks and also women's is a non contact sport that's known for its speed and endurance that's needed to play the game and men's is known as a contact sport that's kind of brutal to watch but it's a lot of fun 
spending collections with weights by side 
exercise for an area right here in the middle section of your body 
we 're going to stand up tall and i want to show you from the side your hips are going to be thug thin and your various gonna be in 
without letting the shoulder hump like this

your knees slightly bent as you do that 
so when you keep your weight by the side make sure that you're also keeping your chest all by squeezing your back muscles bringing the shoulders down by using the back

i think we've given your coworker pilot why don't you 
joe quaker with family resources 
today we're talking about our relationship skills 
specifically how do we encourage our man to share his feelings 
which is how do we get a man to share his feelings and this is really difficult for a lot of guys to do 
it really starts with a solid communication process 
it means that you've got a have a free flow of information of dialogue between the man and a woman for this to happen 
in these before duplex back and forth 
and nothing will be communicated unless both have clear mines and have a full understanding of of what's taking place or what's not taking place 
the first thing that you want to eliminate is a fact that perhaps it's because of you that he's not sharing his feelings 
so sit down and talk 
asking the question 
why is it that you're having a hard time sharing your feelings 
is it something 
because maybe he might feel that you're actually not listening 
so that you need to eliminate that that perspective by first 
thing that you can do is share your feelings 
and make sure that he understands how it is with positive communication and being able to share feelings 
so do by example 
he won't volunteer than ask 
say let's let's start a pattern 
funny how how did you feel about this 
for this situation what could we have done differently 
how do you feel about buying a house 
so how do you feel about having another child 
so how do you feel about moving here 
what do you think about the situation in my job 
for what did you feel about the situation in your job 
so open up and have it and have a dialogue and explained to him how you feel positively about him sharing his feelings 
when he does open up say that it's a positive experience and something that's very important and key to you 
so if you need to have this dialogue started with a positive aspect of communication and and talk about things are areas where there may be some improvement or some help could be used 
workshops it can be attended family resources marriage education workshops in counseling but it's important that you have solid communication first before you can learn to encourage your man had a share his feelings

going to show you some types of slide lubrication 
usually you can get most of these at your local music store 
some of them might have to be special order 
it depends on what she'd like to use 
secure sound that i like 
first of our start off with our outcasts this is kind of like an all around oil 
you can use this slide chump of hours if you play all kinds of different stuff 
but his real good lubrication 
the only thing i don't like about it is that it oils can attract dirt and grime and which can gum upper slide a lot faster 
the next thing we're going to talk about is super slick and this is probably the mac daddy of trombone slides slide claims 
a little tube like that tub like that last you probably ten years 
is fairly inexpensive in a you do need to have a spray bottle with water for this one now 
this is a non biodegradable substance which is good for fire 
and also have a all synthetic oil here which is real nice because he only thing about it is that it contains petroleum distillates and it can be bad for you 
then we have our slide cream this is probably the least i recommend 
it really can go on for your slide of real good 
a lot of old timers will use pawns just facial cream and don't recommend that as well 
really gums are bad and makes your slide feel pretty dirty and nasty 
so i guess the best one i would recommend is the super slick 
and that will help keep your trombone young and need a little bit and i hope you keep your side very slick 
those are some types of slides lubrication 
we're going to work on his shoulder role 
is a movement that starts from the inside of the body and the energy travels away from the body 
so it's a real good basic movement for other arm movements 
we're going to start with putting our arm out 
so you get a clear shot of my shoulder here 
we're going to press the shoulder forward 
lifted up slightly not too much because we don't want to lose our nice long neck here 
began to slide it as far back as we can 
and then press that shoulder down 
and then bring it all the way to the front 
so i always like to start with a box movement first make sure you're hitting all of those points 
and then you're going around it out and make it smoothes 
so let's try that with account for on our movements 
we're gonna go one two three four 
one two three four 
one two three four 
going around it out 
such as smooth out those corners 
and make it nice and round 
try to keep the hands too 
it's gonna move slightly that you want to move naturally 
we don't want the movement out here to be bigger than what your shoulder is doing 
practices on both sides of your body 
and then you can practice alternating them 
in our moving onto the ice 
and the first thing you want to do is put a base color on the whole entire lead 
it will just help your eye shadow go on better and smoother 
and it just creates a nice highlight under the brow 
based colors very very important 
i chose a very neutral kind of nudie champagne color 
it's got a bit of an iridescent too 
why use at all the time 
called the grain 
it 's like a grainy iridescent colors 
and amusing a big rush 
you can't really mess up 
we just want to pile it on 
when a pilot all over the lid 
and as you can see it's just very neutral 
barry neutral but it has an iridescent to look beautiful 
it goes on very very silky 
we just want to put it all over the eye 
under the brow all over the lid and even underneath the eye 
cup for me 
to take it a little bit underneath 
it just gives a nice highlight underneath the eye 
if everything looks blended 
basis just very very important 
if you put on a nice space everything you put on top of it will go on just beautiful 
a couple of time 
but you can't mess it up 
we just put it on and put it on and so you think you have it right 
how can that relationship to improve if i need to do anything particular about it 
then you can talk about the time fears also that harmlessly long will it take before i get mad 
in a particular god will say that this time or it doesn't really happen 
it can be a collapsible 
those things can be catered to this god but they have to be based on relationships are not finances are not anything 
so make sure if you're pulling out cards that has to be a specific questions based on it 
and now let me show you how to add a little color to the windmill 
we're going to decorate the roof will make a few decorations but first will decorate the roof and we're going to use our match sticks again the way we do this is we coat the top of the milk carton and angles down with glue and we can either brush along with a paintbrush or we can have the kids who are doing the project if they want to just smeared with their finger and while it's still web 
we lay across the mat matchsticks we use a solid color red tiled roof so we chose for this project all the red match sticks and will lay them across the top of the milk carton 
using a solid colors recommended because we have a lot of colors on the arms of the windmill so we don't want to make it too busy 
the red itself is is also gives a nice so realistic touch to that it looks actually like a roof 
so the match sticks actually fit nicely across the top of the windmill they don't have to fit exactly the same measurement as the as the top of the carton but if you lay them across a double them up even though they hang over a little bit they still fit nicely onto the answer the the side of the milk carton and we only have to do one side to side obviously in the front that's going to be seen when we go all the way down to the bottom of the of weren't angles and starts going starts going vertical again 
is really just for decoration and it's not a necessary part of the project obviously if you want to paint directly onto the milk carton different designs are different different types of pictures you can also do that 
so here's i read tiled roof for our windmill 
for teens is actually one of the easier forms of solitaire 
when it on a regular basis 
there won't be long gaps between the times that you play and win 
that said normally when you play for teens and you come to a situation where you can't make a play well as a matter of fact the hand is over 
but if you want to give yourself another opportunity another bite at the apple if you will you can take out take down the tab blow and reshuffle and put out new stacks 
i would say that points and she would have moved cards to the formation to the foundation at that point don't make any snacks are five make all stacks of four 
program 
so you give yourself a new town below and a new chance to win at fourteen 
we joke about makers called pineapple cocktail 
go and put some ice and over the last year and measure a one shot a light run 
the one ounce of labor on two ounces of pineapple juice and one shot of lemon juice one ounce followed up with a half a shot of grenadine i have right here 
and we'll go ahead and shake that up 
yes i go 

we got our glass here 
so let's go and poured in 
the last thing will do is just top it off with some clubs soda 
right it will add a straw 
and if you like you can garnish that with a pineapple oregon to serve it up as is 
bottoms up 
in this series we're going to teach you about general acupressure points places to work on your dog for overall arthritis 
they were going to talk about buying a new car 
this segment or to be talking about researching your new car purchase 
any time you go out and purchase a new product be sure that you find out the most that you can to avoid any mishaps or problems 
in this case what that means to you is so you're not wasting your time and everyone else has tons 
before you go out to your local dealership to purchase a new car nature at its that car that you're looking for 
picture that car offers you the gas mileage you're looking for and it offers the features that you're looking for 
needing something in a larger s u v type don't go look at a honda because they don't offer a large issue 
look at another manufacturer that offers a large s you 
if you've got twelve kids you may want to go look at a van or a minivan 
make sure you find out exactly what your needs are when it comes to a new automobile purchase before you go out and invest your time and looking at a new car 
there are lots of places to look in order to do research 
edmunds 
online and find out about your car and what kind of safety ratings it has it will kind of other options and benefits the car provides that you're most interested in 
again doing research will save you a lot of time in a long runs and don't forget to do 
here we have a flutter sleeve 
this is right here my drawing a lover pleaded but that is the best way to render it to show you that it's not necessarily please 
iron plates there's just a lot of fabric yardage live missionary wise that you are condensing in order to so it in to your given measurements of your existing are more 
this if you're doing a straight leg straight source leave it's going to have measurement like this and it's going to be more fitted 
with this you have to have the same measurement on the top 
it has to fit in if this is fifteen inches you have to make whatever eighty inches of fabric for your flutter sleeve gathered and put into effect in space 
so that determines the amount of fabric determines the flutter ability that our but it determines the amount of water and a half years leave and it also is based on what kind of fabric reuse because if you're using a thick horse fabric you're not going to have as much flutter as if you're using a jersey fabric that can be condensed more to have more of a range of motion and fluidity 
almost ready

jason catch mark from my space for musicians 
i'm going to show you how to check if your friends are online 
it 's very easy and there's a couple of ways to do it 
first things first 
start with the basic and you just quit your mouse over friends and click online friends 
when you click it take you to a page you're going to see everybody that's online 
so you could see that their online but there's a couple other ways to tell if their online 
if you go to their myspace page will actually have this little green text with the orange by and it'll be flashing like this and say online 
so that's another way if you're on the profile of see if they're actually online maybe they're checking their messages or something 
such a good time to catch him 
aside from that the third way would be if you're on your homepage and let's say you're in your inbox will do is actually load on the right side air when you're checking messages other online friends 
so maybe you're actually sending a message to one of your friends you'll actually see them show up here 
if you have a lot of friends and only show a few of them but there's another place that it'll show the online friends 
that 's how you check to see if your friend is online 
jason catch merck from my space for musicians 
in addition to forms of permanent idea that which are actually directly on your dog then there's also id tags that you can order from companies and have on the color 
so you take a look at ursus collar here on her collar she's got her name her owner's name her address the state in town and phone number and that is attached to the collar 
so you can put this on the dog wall there walking the reason why it's still good to have some form of permanent id is in case the color comes off 
sometimes people actually don't like to have colors on the dog especially if they're walking with multiple drugs and does might be playing with each other because that can set of a potentially dangerous situation where one gets the color stuck on their jaw any other drug can actually choke 
so you don't always want to have a collar on your dog but it is an option to put tags on the collar if you are going to have collar on your dog 
another drill that will help you were ballhandling which i had to learn 
i remember having learned is called the figure eight the urethra 
figure eight drew is different in a little different in a figure eight dribble which will show you will show you next 
but the drink figure eight drill the way you do it is you grab the ball like this and you just want to go make a figure eight with the basketball inside and outside of your legs 
so when you're doing it as you continue to do it this is a draw that most of these as most of these ballhandling jurors will do your forearm you'll start to feel if you're doing them like you're supposed to be doing them you start to fill a tightening in your forearm after doing them continuously and and over and over and over and over 
so when you're doing the figure eight drew you want to get to the point where you can do it quicker and quicker and quicker and as you get quicker will be a little bit better handling 
you can go outside to end like this and get faster or you can reverse 
as you reverse it which is usually a little bit harder you actually get better with the figure eight dribble which i'm going to show you a little bit later 
showing you the figure age room 
so you want to keep your speed up to 
so if you see a lot of deep powder and you need to ride through it or you want to go out right and indeed power try to plan your track way ahead so that way you can keep your speed up because otherwise you could sit down and then you'll be in your sled out

and i want to punish our visualizing what i want my head i'm going to make some maybe these pants i always make them different things maybe that's not a horror maybe it'll be no government take over whatever it is 
whatever you just want to go you want to visualize and with your pants and your patch so that when you place it you've got good placement and it looks like what you're going for 
so i really like the size are really like where it's going to fit everything is good with their so we need to stretch and paint and started can ready for everything will take it from there 
this has always been my area of trouble 
i can't draw the jews say my life 
so i'm going to spend more time than probably necessary on it 
but it helped me too 
so bear with me and he might learn something 
bears shoes are very important 
definitely denotes the professional quality of your drawing for the obvious reason that your feet are the means of support even on a two dimensional paper drawing the basis of support 
a general rule of thumb is that the feet these issues from this one the feet are about as long as the head is from top to cheer 
their dependence 
shoes obviously that you've got i did fetishes finish tight shoes for this so big platforms aisles whatever 
and that's going to build on it 
as long as you can tell you have your bases of her feet at that's right size it'll their balance 
a great whodunit guessing game and you should use a minimum of six to eight people 
the more the merrier 
what you do when you choose one person who's just going to run the game 
we don't actually get to participate so if you are playing us with kids navy fear of an adult in the room they could choose to be the one running the game or just maybe an adult that doesn't feel like plane if it's a group of adults they can run again 
basically they're going to have all the adults close their eyes or kids clothes or cover your eyes and the person running the game will choose one person to be the murderer 
we just choose them by tapping them gently on the head 
that person is the murder only they know it and the person running the game knows it 
everybody 's eyes open and the game begins 
we just start walking around the room shaking everybody's hands with a nice recruiting hi how are you hi how are you 
when the murderer chooses they will choose the victim and killed them 
how they will do that is by shaking their hand and doing a little tickle inside 
so just scratching the inside of the hand but doing it very discreetly so that no one else sees when the victim has been killed 
they have to shake three more hands just so that it's not obvious who killed them and then they get to choose a way they want to die nice and begun dramatic 
so if i was to kill david hi how are you he's going to shake three more hands on the third hand die 
get than we ever victim deadline on the floor and the rest of us have to try to figure out who killed him 
again only the person running the game and the person that's dead knows that the person instead can't say anything 
so your vote and the majority wins whoever you want to it's kind of a witch hunt at this point you just pick and choose you think might look suspicious and if that person actually is indeed the murderer let's save everyone agrees that was joe the person running the gain knows of its joe or not if it was joe they say yes you guys have one if it's not they just say no that is not the murderer and you just joe has to die though and then the game goes again and again until either the murder is killed everybody off without being killed themselves or until they've been found out by the crowd 
and that's how you play murder 
i'm going to show you how to make some pasta 
but very simple boiling 
we have a couple of quarts of water at the boil and now we're going to add ourselves 
we don't want to add salt before the water is boiling because believe it or not the salt sitting at the bottom of the parent can pitted 
it can actually does all the metal so you want to wanted to be boiling when you put the salt 
to put a lot of salted and just needed a couple of tablespoons of oil and what that's going to do is that's going to help keep them from sticking together 
i have about twelve ounces of brown rice pen a positive 
isn't that beautiful 
the water is boiling i'm just going to put right 
getting started a little bit so that all the noodles get coated with the oil and that's going to lead to boil for about seven minutes 
past is done in origami to drain it 
we're going to use our sheen why again and we're going to poor sorry i'm left handed 
are pasta right into the sheet war and let it drain 
so i'd like to do with the with the rice pasta it has to be a little bit more starchy so i like to have some hot water handy and i just rinse it again turns off any excess starch because otherwise it changes the texture of your saucer it's just a little unpleasant 
but it's that simple 
we have pasa now
