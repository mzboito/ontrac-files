how_00361_0008410_0014460 people shed scale skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around 
how_00361_0015250_0035380 snakes scales are a little different they're more like an armor coating on the outside and then it will allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like dragged down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake well not really too much of a baby anymore

how_00642_0015360_0023450 upper body you don't want to be timid are shy i know it's going to feel a little silly if you don't really move your arms but you should really be moving your arms 
how_00642_0023910_0042940 and the reason why you'll see the arm movement a lot especially as the intensity increases in let's say you come to that hill you really want to make sure you move your arms because you're now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body and you're getting more oxygen into your lungs and your breathing in the fresh air blowing it back out and full body movement 
how_00642_0043390_0048660 as far as your lower body your legs you want to make sure that you put most of the way down your calves

how_00642_0062550_0066590 notice the difference the next time you run just remember in your mind what i said 
how_00642_0066990_0075970 for more than you move your arms you're going to see yourself increasing speed and you're going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there were just very little movement

how_00923_0139090_0153660 but then opens up a excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that have typed in an inner simply says exhale that run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one 
how_00923_0155190_0159860 linked to this function xl test within an object in your database 
how_00923_0164920_0169360 one day rangers and i've just showed you how to run an excel macro from access

how_11890_0011470_0017130 what i'm talking about is no longer do you have any nonverbals to work 
how_11890_0017710_0025980 on the other end of that phone that can't see your face that can't see your body they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment

how_11997_0016330_0026840 you can have your fingers more open inserted a cone shape stroking down the side of the horse starting at the pole and working all the way back 
how_11997_0027140_0035400 but it's actually a fairly safe stroke to use either form of flourish horses most likely they almost always enjoy it 
how_11997_0035400_0045480 they don't find it to be too invasive it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the unless you're being really careless it's a fairly safe strove to be using 
how_11997_0046540_0059370 so again i'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of calming on the horse or having your fingers clothes and stroking down the sides of the horse

how_12094_0030840_0039520 we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect everywhere that we know they're going to need to and the all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to do so 
how_12094_0039520_0055080 please take the angled brush back again the black back out and really the less paint you have on here to better just a very little on the tip of your brush discipline 
how_12094_0055080_0058060 it needs to be filled in and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes were just 
how_12094_0058060_0061340 and set the pain right on it phil

how_12112_0011560_0016260 when here's a common mistake that people make when they're doing their kickboxing moves 
how_12112_0016570_0024820 if i'm hitting the bag or i'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move 
how_12112_0024820_0035450 will try and slammed the bag as hard as i can remember what happens when you do that is one you waste a lot of energy to tense the body up three tend to run out of gas faster 
how_12112_0035960_0044560 if you don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how's that 
how_12112_0045360_0055730 have techniques that i'm just going to snap that's going to pop out there so i'm like a snap snap snap and about every seventh or eighth or bad raw file and recover 
how_12112_0055830_0073860 power so i'm mixing my snapping speed techniques with my power techniques to every time you step and so every time you saw technique you want to make sure your penetrating with your footwork and i was not standing in one spot dig a hole 
how_12112_0074080_0089140 every time you throw your first move you always close the gap and your opponent calm in engage and then clear step out reopen the gap with a clearing technique electrically with a job or are clear with the front round cake 
how_12112_0089610_0100070 so i engage step in fire fire fire clear and then here's the biggie change my alignment on the bag will target and then repeat the process 
how_12112_0100720_0117790 so we're mixing are snapping techniques with our power techniques not just doing power all the time to every attack penetrating for work engage clearing footwork change your line that's always the pattern

how_12277_0000270_0000730 
how_12277_0003060_0006770 so i'm going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch 
how_12277_0007210_0015560 here 's our rip and if you're doing a real repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment 
how_12277_0015610_0027410 branches closely as possible but for purposes of showing you and so that you can see exactly what i'm doing and what the stitch looks like i'm going to use of black thread 
how_12277_0027760_0029490 it should make it easier for you to see 
how_12277_0029490_0044060 now start with you want to not your friend like i showed you the nice could not and we're going to come up from the back of the garment about a half an inch from the start of the rip 
how_12277_0044460_0097680 we 're gonna come up in from the back to the front of the fabric and then you're going to make a deal go back in just a very small amount like centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch probably an eighth of an inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you'll go on the opposite side of it where you came out to go in and take again about an eighth somewhere between a quarter an eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider 
how_12277_0097680_0108040 we're going to start very small and close a little wider a little wider and you'll see what we're going to get 
how_12277_0108890_0127690 and here we go so now you're stitches started small bigger bigger and their straight up and down perpendicular to the rip about an eighth of an inch and go in down here 
how_12277_0133240_0152370 and now we're were up to where the rip begins and we're going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter of an eighth of an inch stitches and now we're going to go across the rip we're going to enter here again 
how_12277_0153120_0158850 about an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip to 
how_12277_0158850_0166080 as long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't it won't be coming out there 
how_12277_0167630_0169190 we pull that through 
how_12277_0170400_0180890 see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rear and let me get a few more and then i'll show you what to do 
how_12277_0182340_0193090 so then once we get a bunch of those and we're going to pull them very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together 
how_12277_0193820_0195300 it almost looks like the same 
how_12277_0196250_0201370 so the smaller the stitches the more delicate repair will be 
how_12496_0009090_0013090 scimitars leone and scimitars another very powerful artifact equipment 
how_12496_0013310_0020920 once again he had to put it in play and attach it to a creature through its equip cost to put this in the play and honor creature

how_12496_0038190_0040890 which means it costs you to take what creature 
how_12496_0041250_0051710 well with this cause you're going to get a plus one plus one on targeted creature which doesn't seem that great for two but remember that when that creature goes to a graveyard this stays and boy 
how_12496_0051970_0055960 so the next creature it will only take one to equip it to that creature 
how_12496_0056500_0059620 again this is very important and makes it a very powerful car 
how_12622_0007100_0013480 normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing is i would write out a petition 
how_12622_0013900_0020330 that would be almost like a prayer saying what i intend to do and for whom i intend to do it 
how_12622_0021220_0028450 then i sometimes use a pop it as i had mentioned before and i would wrap herbs around it 
how_12622_0028860_0034290 for if say they had a broken leg i would concentrate the healing on the lake part 
how_12622_0036450_0044970 sometimes what i do is take a photograph and put the photograph over the face so that it actually looks like the person 
how_12622_0045450_0047630 that's called sympathetic magic 
how_12622_0047900_0053360 where i'm not actually doing the magic on somebody but i'm doing it on some thing instead 
how_12622_0053990_0064490 then i would place it on the tentacle and i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person 
how_12622_0065130_0070490 and of course for the highest good of all and that it harm none 
how_12852_0000670_0004050 this edge weapon attack we're going to look at the hooking attack one more time 
how_12852_0004450_0007610 but this time i want to use a twisting or a locking type techniques 
how_12852_0007610_0010260 or use the same type of set up i did here 
how_12852_0010630_0015610 come out similarly continue to roll it over the movement disposition here 
how_12852_0016510_0019460 some already moving naturally enough as it in that direction again 
how_12852_0019890_0021040 here 's my arms come here 
how_12852_0021360_0027740 plenty to do is step as a come in here but my elbow overhears and then draw him dan and through 
how_12852_0028410_0033160 his hand is above his elbow and cause a great deal distress and easily pop the blade 
how_12852_0036840_0039850 here are just going to draw him around 
how_12852_0040190_0046090 and as i do that my initial my inertia my spinning drags him along with me 
how_12852_0046130_0047820 i had to do very little to make that happen 
how_12852_0049100_0053850 pressed down and in the blade comes out eject the attacker away 
how_12852_0057860_0059940 this remember i'm getting off the line 
how_12852_0060660_0061690 concerts here and do this 
how_12852_0062930_0066360 from here i'm off the line making pause and contact with the risk 
how_12852_0066880_0072330 already really kind of started this way so continue in arm over and and i go 
how_12852_0072990_0075520 pressed down in pop and i found 
how_12852_0075520_0077630 eject the attacker 
how_12968_0005260_0009190 by now we're going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project 
how_12968_0010310_0012410 got here my hand as a paint will 
how_12968_0012750_0016550 it gives the different colors that independent stores will offer 
how_12968_0017840_0020640 so you can have this great selection to choose from 
how_12968_0022090_0034680 depending upon the application you're going to either want to get a flat an eggshell san blas semi glass all that can be done regardless of your coat color choices 
how_12968_0036980_0046480 personally i would put a glossary semi gloss on your doors and an eggshell or sat in on your walls 
how_12968_0047150_0052980 it can use flat to go along your shillings or you can use a satin finish for that as well 
how_12968_0052980_0063930 the reason for this from a different sheen's is to bring out the different colors the different textures and also durability and clean ability 
how_12968_0064360_0071260 higher gloss paint is going to give you more of the cleavable surface whereas a flat pain is not easily is clean 
how_13006_0004150_0021590 and you can't see it 's not going to have to explain it but it is not a box light so whatever when you haven't at an angle whatever whenever catches on this side is going to write down and go to run out that you're going to have your stockpile down at the end 
how_13006_0021630_0024260 it doesn't gathered up on both sides and bring it through 
how_13006_0025110_0032930 it'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or relocation dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side 
how_13006_0032960_0043310 this this unlike the box blade he is not box hand and so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and will eventually go over to the side 
how_13006_0043310_0053870 when you want that for snow removal or or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road after the side of the road and that's what this kind of blade with before 
how_13068_0001050_0007340 very with michael britain films that org look at in salt lake city utah we're talking about using microsoft windows 
how_13068_0008010_0011060 and now want to talk to you about how to save a file with a different name 
how_13068_0011450_0012690 this is very helpful 
how_13068_0012690_0027570 for example if you create a file in a word or excel and then you decide you want to change the name or like let's say for example you're creating a spreadsheet for your budget for the month of january and then come the next month you want to use the same spreadsheet but it's for the month of february and you want to separate 
how_13068_0027570_0036350 warner re save over the january once you're going to want to relay will that february and say to you that the same location or another location and so i'm going to show you how to do that 
how_13068_0037780_0044470 let me start by saying that windows xp as a registered trademark of microsoft and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft 
how_13068_0045340_0060930 to save a file with a different name is very important because you might want to reuse some of the same files and eventually changed the name so that you don't really save over the yield file so that you still have the old file 
how_13068_0061280_0065530 i've gone ahead and opened a word document here called document one 
how_13068_0065880_0069800 that is the default name for any word document when i opened it up 
how_13068_0070260_0075710 we 're gonna go ahead and just type in a bunch of jargon here 
how_13068_0076480_0078030 well let's save this document 
how_13068_0078030_0086400 we say let's just go ahead and save as and we're going to choose it to go to our desktop 
how_13068_0086730_0102210 it automatically chooses the first couple of letters of our of our text so what we're going to do this we're going to go ahead and change this to test document and there were in a scroll of here to save and it's going to save it to the desktop 
how_13068_0103150_0108020 and as you can see up in the upper left hand corner or document now is called test document microsoft word 
how_13068_0108840_0110550 glenn close out of this document 
how_13068_0111510_0115790 as you can see over here in our desktop we've created a file called test document 
how_13068_0117090_0129970 what i'm going to do is i'm going to double click on this and reopened as because while we want to do is let's say a couple of months have gone by in our test document whatever he typed and that was really important but we need to make some changes but even though we make the changes we still want to keep the original file 
how_13068_0129970_0147730 what we're going to do so we're going to open our original file and then let's say we want to make some changes by may be dropping some of this text down maybe want to add some text here maybe want to add some numbers or something 
how_13068_0148210_0160370 what we're gonna do as with when we go to file we don't want to click save because what that's going to do is over right our existing test document that erasing what we've had originally 
how_13068_0160690_0167010 so if we want to keep the original and save this is a new separate file we're going to want to go to save as again 
how_13068_0167960_0172240 this time when it comes up it's going to bring it up as the old named has taken me 
how_13068_0172240_0174280 we do not want to click save just yet 
how_13068_0174970_0184280 let 's say we want to add in test document to so that we have a part to actually better yet let's write poetry test document part two 
how_13068_0184880_0188440 and now we can either hit enter or left click with their mouse on save 
how_13068_0189040_0190750 we've chosen the same into the desktop 
how_13068_0191500_0195130 now says if you look in the upper left hand corner as test document part two 
how_13068_0195830_0203340 closes document and we see that on our desktop we have now created we now to documents created 
how_13068_0203760_0207490 we have test document and test document part two 
how_13068_0208060_0214970 that 's how you successfully save the file with a different name thus organizing your desktop or your computer a lot better 
how_13292_0001110_0014290 to suited ace three suited this is pretty much the best omaha high low hand because it gives you gives you the aces when the high if you catch another acer too 
how_13292_0015450_0021100 it gives you suited ace to suit at age three 
how_13292_0021490_0032940 with these you can pick up a high of a straight you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush 
how_13292_0033240_0038390 so you have a number of ways to when the high also you have a number of ways to win the low 
how_13292_0038880_0041070 what does that mean visually 
how_13292_0041330_0043570 well let's look at this board here that i've laid out 
how_13292_0044230_0059640 we've got a board of jack ten eight three and five and our opponent has played a rather dubious hand for omaha high low 
how_13292_0059890_0068170 but played it nonetheless and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to the queen 
how_13292_0069950_0077990 alas he does not when the low with his five to he doesn't qualify for low because he matches the five 
how_13292_0078950_0090120 we on the other hand have a low hand we have eight five three deuce ace so we would win half the pot 
how_13366_0011790_0026400 bouquet sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and occasion cooking are sausage making that they stuff about just about anything 
how_13366_0026790_0040010 to casings in the sausage you can do rabbit can do ghosts can do chicken turkey catfish i mean basically anything 
how_13366_0040350_0048950 the trick is to figure out the right seasonings the goals will what those meat that you use or they're fascinating 
how_13366_0050330_0062460 today we're going to do as a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and we're going to use some pork to actually bind together 
how_13366_0063100_0071630 another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg white to create and by 
how_13366_0072190_0081310 for this recipe we're going to do some a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our feelings so let's get started 
how_13411_0000670_0013000 another important thing for you to remember and this is going to be a little difficult because we all tend to like to please people we all tend to like accolades and praise 
how_13411_0013340_0021040 but it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech 
how_13411_0021870_0025720 everyone does not have to love you 
how_13411_0026280_0033640 found that out many many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students 
how_13411_0034190_0041910 invariably i would have one or maybe two a semester that just they soon like me 
how_13411_0042370_0044830 it didn't matter what i did they didn't like me 
how_13411_0045420_0047060 that was oh 
how_13411_0048360_0052430 ok if one or two people disagree with your speech 
how_13411_0052800_0057750 ok if one or two or three people don't like you 
how_13411_0058070_0068080 you have to continue to allow that to be ok you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker 
how_13411_0068080_0071110 while the last time i did that speech everybody hated it 
how_13411_0071700_0073700 or everybody said i was bad 
how_13411_0074410_0086000 past failures of people not liking your speech or not liking you have nothing to do with present and future presentations 
how_13411_0086490_0088100 maybe that happened before 
how_13411_0088480_0089660 ok so what 
how_13411_0089660_0090380 and move on 
how_13411_0091160_0095540 it won't happen this time just because it happened last time 
how_13416_0000330_0003320 what we'll do at this point is mount the blanks on a mandarin 
how_13416_0003320_0012810 when she take off the excess pushing center nudge slide your blank on the second bushings 
how_13416_0013860_0016570 are important because they'll size you on each end 
how_13416_0017200_0031280 and now that we couldn't put the second blank on because it's a little bit too long so we'll use a spacer a washer and not to hold the pieces 
how_13416_0032690_0040550 it has a number to taper to fit this and and you'll see at this and there's a conical conical hole 
how_13416_0041450_0057510 way this works you'll see it into the man drove into the spindle and bring up your tail stock a cone center in it and bring it up snug 
how_13416_0058140_0059070 titan

how_13447_0000510_0003940 there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking 
how_13447_0004320_0012030 the first one that need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored or right 
how_13447_0012370_0018850 and a lot of this has to do with structure which i'm going to talk about in a minute but you're thinking on your feet 
how_13447_0019040_0028860 you know the topic but you have to while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation you have to keep your audience interested 
how_13447_0030860_0038720 he can't ramble on you can't have random organizational patterns you have to keep the audience with you 
how_13447_0038720_0043340 so that's something that you run the risk of this is your audience not staying with you 
how_13447_0044440_0053520 obviously you're your goal your aim is to appear affective as a public speaker giving a well thought out speech 
how_13447_0053840_0062670 while you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought out speech you just met the topic 
how_13447_0063020_0073840 so you have to try and present a well thought out speech but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time 
how_13447_0074200_0093390 also one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details you haven't had time to research you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech so you're going to miss out on some of those details 
how_13447_0093740_0107070 and those are some of the negatives that there are not in such great things about impromptu speaking just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech

how_02744_0036410_0045820 but again the more and more you could prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be 
how_02744_0046140_0054300 some of the muscles that you'll use would be obvious you your forearms your biceps your lattes your back

how_02810_0016350_0026850 not nest site with the same character and i'll be a little conflicted back with a range of characters that people are having knees and commercial experience and are able to identify with these people as they read 
how_02810_0026980_0043740 and right now i'm talking primarily about stories were short stories are novels but there's actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting advertising and if you're writing a story more for commercial 
how_02810_0043800_0046220 you still want to know how to develop good characters 
how_02810_0046710_0052290 so but primarily out and take money from a standpoint of traditional story 
how_02810_0052800_0067800 so one thing that i find it very helpful and a lot of really great writers have mentioned and neither writers who were rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them and is to develop a really great character 
how_02810_0067800_0072040 have a little bit of information that natural much information so 
how_02810_0072070_0082330 if they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of bodies that character someone from rural life that they know that that they don't know too well 
how_02810_0082330_0096670 do is and retain their writing from that characters perspective or about that character they will think what would that person that i do how they react how would they sound how they look kind of looked at from that perspective 
how_02810_0096670_0105740 and it's not someone that you know sipper well and so there's still a lot of imagination and creative interpretation which i think is very important which is why they do that so basically

how_05212_0027780_0037850 important things you need to know about the player is when you want to change tracks use this button that's called push and you turn it sideways 
how_05212_0037850_0039580 push it turn it sideways 
how_05212_0039580_0042030 and you can see the track numbers is advancing

how_05212_0050080_0068060 and now a great feature of the cd player is if you decide this is the track you want instead of hitting pause which just pauses it or hitting stop which actually would bring you back to track one you can hits go find to find the track you want again track three in this case 
how_05212_0068560_0069150 it play 
how_05212_0069150_0070490 that's what i want 
how_05212_0070650_0076710 then you hit the queue button and what that does is is it brings you back to the beginning of track three

how_05347_0009180_0010490 what happens now 
how_05347_0010650_0012770 well we're going to roll another card right 
how_05347_0014070_0020150 player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts 
how_05347_0020820_0022320 we see where he's trying to sell their 
how_05347_0022320_0028260 is trying to sell a straight or flash or straight flush or a royal flush 
how_05347_0029440_0038070 you roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit 
how_05347_0039170_0044820 we 're trying to sell a straight flush a straight flush or a royal 
how_05347_0045970_0057410 to your left we see again a sales pitch and i rollouts a potential straight 
how_05347_0058030_0071520 so we're all selling here and considering that these hands are on similar footing i don't think any of us are going away but you should bed and we'll talk more about that in the next segment 
how_05524_0000510_0007660 in this clip we'd like to show you how to load your shotgun your pump action shotgun first 
how_05524_0007660_0013220 for most important part to loading your pump shotgun is always make sure that your safety is applied 
how_05524_0013220_0022270 in order to do that you always want to make sure that the red dot is showing or your safety is and safe position now 
how_05524_0022270_0026500 there are two different ways a load of pump pump action shotgun 
how_05524_0026500_0037610 first way would be to take the shotgun open the action put around in the chamber and close to slide down and 
how_05524_0037610_0045270 once you have the ground in the chamber at that point you could load the additional rounds in the magazine too 
how_05524_0045270_0059990 second way and i'm going to show you this a little more clearly if you take a closer look here is to take the rounds push down the loading gate right here and then take your shotgun shells and push him in 
how_05524_0059990_0065150 and here the spraying that inflationary against as my finger goes in once 
how_05524_0065150_0069620 says loaded you cannot fit another shotgun shell in their lunch 
how_05524_0069620_0079380 for magazine tube is completely loaded you again take the slide release pulled back and then load shotgun 
how_05524_0079380_0080890 you load a pump action shotgun 
how_05533_0000470_0004290 we are back and we're going to talk about the music alphabet 
how_05533_0005020_0010710 so i'm sure you all know the english alphabet is twenty six letters and forgotten 
how_05533_0011670_0017670 the music alphabet is much easier there is only seven letters a b c d e 
how_05533_0018690_0021230 when i got there with members 
how_05533_0023370_0037830 but anyway after gee we start over on a and this is important so that we can read music we can understand music and we can write music it's important to understand 
how_05533_0038330_0039660 let me show you the first string 
how_05533_0039700_0059620 i told you earlier was the eastern after eight we're going to play the f and the gene was the first and ultimately going to go ahead and move on and the second and third strain but it will take some time if this is your first time to get used to the snow 
how_05533_0060230_0066150 such as strong as mainstream followed by a say in the ceiling 
how_05533_0066150_0071710 string as a g followed by a j 
how_05533_0071710_0084380 if i start on this a climb up you can see the alphabet a cd after a the 
how_05533_0084580_0094620 we might have noticed i sometimes move only one for open to the first sometimes i moved to france from seem to do 
how_05533_0094760_0100080 i want you to think of two for its as a holster that's good terminology 
how_05533_0100750_0106350 remember holster to friends and half step is one for open to one 
how_05533_0106380_0108590 for miners 
how_05533_0108770_0117450 so we have the first three strings g c 
how_05533_0117700_0129500 so do that about a thousand times and then we'll come back and we will large technique for the left hand will start plants and stuff and have some fun 
how_05610_0001330_0005330 tim gibson m talking about troubleshooting your refrigerator 
how_05610_0005960_0016090 if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator first two things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not trapped in your main breaker box 
how_05610_0016860_0022320 so you want to locate where that is and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is a reset 
how_05610_0022520_0027090 if it is pop you want to make sure you reset it to the on position 
how_05610_0027770_0035910 the next thing would be to check the power cord manhattan the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet 
how_05610_0037350_0038740 so that's basically on the power 
how_05610_0038740_0050020 now if you still do not have power you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point because it could be something internal to the refrigerator 
how_05610_0052690_0061870 this particular refrigerator it has all electronic controls so it has its own centers which really tell you what's going on 
how_05610_0062280_0072200 this particular model up here if you have some food that may not be staying cool and humid check your temperature control 
how_05610_0072680_0078150 and this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to 
how_05610_0078200_0091240 recommended settings are anywhere from about thirty four degrees to thirty eight degrees depending i really how hot how cold you like to keep some of your product particularly dairy products 
how_05610_0092510_0107070 then the other side here on the fraser side some of the common thing you can run into is whether your ice maker is not distributing irish properly or your waters now coming out 
how_05610_0107460_0117620 water not coming out most of these are equipped with a filter so in this case this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filtering and it tells you when to replace it 
how_05610_0118870_0132320 on the ice occasionally managers come in here where these are frost free freezers this can actually warm up where some of your ice melts together and the air agitating arm can actually get stuck 
how_05610_0132350_0135080 so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasional 
how_05610_0136500_0140620 so i'm tim gibson and that are some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator 
how_05684_0004270_0009290 we 're talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shaped trace 
how_05684_0010310_0019110 we want to reduce reduce the with at the sides so you want to go with a bob you know something short 
how_05684_0019160_0023220 probably a little bit shorter than this but something like this would be really good 
how_05684_0023760_0037250 diamond shaped faces needed a narrow sides and fullness at the chin so if it came down to your chain that would be really good at what sanctuary your look 
how_05684_0037690_0042570 avoid wearing high thun top where volume on the sides

how_05735_0000570_0000780 applause 
how_05735_0005760_0011730 right now we're going to talk about chopping of our onion for our garlic committed reset 
how_05735_0011730_0014340 neat about a quarter cup of onion 
how_05735_0015160_0019760 which were due credit and really thin slices 
how_05735_0021570_0022690 we're gonna miss this 
how_05735_0025840_0026780 other side 
how_05735_0034410_0035260 so that the sun 
how_05735_0036220_0038150 and as you can see the pieces are pretty thin 
how_05735_0038580_0040550 help for the missing part 
how_05735_0040550_0043990 we get them all going the same way that our work 
how_05735_0045940_0047860 go against the wake up before 
how_05735_0049920_0050640 skipton together 
how_05735_0052740_0059470 and if you want to pivot your edge of your knife on one side and fan out hope as well 
how_05735_0060060_0064580 and then find a new pivot point because their wages not cutting the exact same thing 
how_05735_0071530_0074390 when you want your pieces enough about that big 
how_05964_0000490_0005770 we have the bottom prepared and we've got our little ball that has the pedestal and this is set up as well 
how_05964_0005770_0007140 but also as leather hard 
how_05964_0008060_0011370 and as you can see when i set it on their if the little too big 
how_05964_0011370_0013940 it doesn't quite slip into that pedestals 
how_05964_0013940_0015470 so i have to trim this as well 
how_05964_0016830_0021710 what i need to do in order to trim this first you want to get the wheel headway 
how_05964_0021740_0027720 this is important because i just use section for hold my pieces to the wheel 
how_05964_0029980_0038180 and that's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against the sweat peace and i'm going to drop it kind of hard 
how_05964_0039520_0041220 now it sucked on there 
how_05964_0042300_0043670 from hitting it it's not moving 
how_05964_0044660_0050340 so again i'm going to spend it and i'm going to tap it on center 
how_05964_0050410_0056260 and pressed down in the middle you notice it slid at first that was the section releasing 
how_05964_0056290_0059290 pressed down in the middle and that recreates that section 
how_05964_0059320_0065290 so it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center 
how_05964_0065880_0066760 and next will criminal 
how_06031_0000700_0013530 one thing as you notice we don't have any three point lunch here but that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during sometime during that period three point line 
how_06031_0014240_0026190 with three point line is actually i talked about it earlier in one thousand nine point nine for college and high school and actually an mba at the nba lies a little further out twenty three now twenty three feet noni juice 
how_06031_0026510_0029510 so whenever you shouldn't same shooting mechanics 
how_06031_0029950_0031740 we want to take you take your three point 
how_06031_0032970_0043710 i'm going to show you i'm going to take actually go across court here to show you exactly where around about whether three point shot would be being is how we don't have actually have a three point line or when al gore 
how_06031_0044110_0045370 so check me out 
how_06031_0045370_0065220 coming over here in the shooting the three point shot same shooting mechanics applies irregular shot no changes you just might down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot unless you're strong enough to actually get it would etc 
how_06031_0065540_0075270 so you'd taken to taking your three point shot you want to make sure if you're playing outside outdoors you gotta laugh for the way and that's the thing about plant outside 
how_06031_0075270_0076520 we always got a lot for them 
how_06031_0076870_0085040 so if you take a little more distance so you shoot me three points shock to allow for the wind and just like that you take the sat 
how_06031_0085070_0093270 so saying shooting mccain is a black and there you have it shooting the three point shot 
how_06059_0000590_0003900 view gathering she from heaven and earth 
how_06059_0004690_0009260 i want you to if you'd like to follow along with me be great 
how_06059_0009780_0020420 but gather chief from heaven and earth one of the things and she going what's great about she dome is that the movements can be very very simple 
how_06059_0020450_0023260 we don't have to do any complex movements here 
how_06059_0023700_0027330 complex movements later on in higher levels of chewing gum 
how_06059_0027930_0034400 but the wonderful thing about she gum is that she gung can be done with any age group 
how_06059_0034610_0035340 in the age group 
how_06059_0036500_0042870 have movements in she go that eighty year olds can do nine year olds can do 
how_06059_0044070_0050340 we have movements and she goes that require a stronger flexibility more deterrence and so on 
how_06059_0050850_0057600 the point to this is that when we do chico you can do so many different movements 
how_06059_0057630_0068890 so many movements and she gun that when you learn a great amount to chew gum you can pick what she would like to do what your body can can handle 
how_06059_0069310_0069860 pay

how_06885_0000570_0004150 ok so we're throwing a platter here large plate 
how_06885_0004540_0010170 and the first thing we're going to want to do is centered the clay before we start to throw 
how_06885_0011370_0014380 i like to do first get the clay nice and wet 
how_06885_0016500_0022990 and the first thing i'd like to do is push the clay down onto the wheel to make sure it's stuck like so 
how_06885_0028020_0032350 is pushing down on the clay to make sure it's nicely stuck onto the back 
how_06885_0033780_0044050 centering is a process of squeezing the clay up through your hands and pushing it back down and as you push it back down your your forcing the clay onto the center of the wheel 
how_06885_0044420_0048410 i'm going to use this part of my hand to force them to santa 
how_06885_0048610_0055840 and i'm going to lock that into a part of my body and my gut here so that i have nice control 
how_06885_0055840_0061000 i'm going to use this part of my hand to push the clay back down and push it onto the surface 
how_06885_0062070_0063450 first we're going to bring it up 
how_06885_0063860_0068110 and i'm just going to use these two parts of my hand to push to play 
how_06885_0075400_0076860 and i'm going to push it back down 
how_06885_0080670_0089950 it's important to note that i'm not simply drawing the clay from the outside and pulling it up around the edges i'm actually squeezing the clay up into itself 
how_06885_0090770_0093120 whereby centering the entire piece of clay 
how_06885_0093150_0110040 if you have some clay at the bottom now which is throwing you off you can see how that's not on santa 
how_06885_0110890_0115700 simply take a rib to take that offer them 
how_06885_0117770_0124590 going to do a few more times to demonstrate squeezing the clay up 
how_06885_0126360_0127620 and pushing it back down 
how_06885_0130030_0138640 and maybe making it look easy here and it will be frustrating if you're just starting out just sitting down and beginning to throw 
how_06885_0138790_0140950 but you really have to do this over and over again 
how_06885_0142040_0144540 and after a while you'll get the hang of it 
how_06885_0145750_0151850 but don't be intimidated it doesn't work out first time it doesn't work out the first time for anyone 
how_06885_0158170_0159980 so we have a pretty nicely scented up 
how_06885_0160300_0174910 a difference to the difference between centering clay for a pot and centering clay for something like a platter is we're actually going to make it we're going to central platform and make it much wider and we normally would 
how_06885_0179630_0185560 is pushing it down onto the wheel centering on form 
how_06885_0187860_0202330 squared up a little bit take some access off the edge 
how_06885_0202740_0212850 so now we have a scented piece of clay on the back and the next thing we're going to do is enter the form and pull out the walls of this planet 
how_06885_0213340_0215710 will be doing that in the next part of this lesson 
how_06943_0000360_0005960 the next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially his inner courtyard or stomach forty four 
how_06943_0005960_0010420 this one's really easy to find it's literally between the second and third toe 
how_06943_0010710_0013390 so you're just going to rub in between the toes 
how_06943_0013390_0029080 run your finger in their massage and between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain relaxing the muscles and dogs like t generally have their feet massaged by their owners they don't like i'm touched by the vets much quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything 
how_06943_0029440_0031830 you can do a four foot massage on them if you like 
how_06943_0031830_0040340 good acupressure points in between the other toes as well but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain and the back limbs 
how_06943_0040800_0048270 want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this nice hurting is compensating by using this leg 
how_06943_0048300_0051690 so you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs 
how_06943_0052150_0053330 we want to work that point 
how_06943_0053630_0064660 again this is a massage just rubbing that muscle between your fingers that tissues between your fingers and really rubbed up fairly hard feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area 
how_07012_0003500_0010110 in this clip we're going to talk about what you do once you get on top of the ramp 
how_07012_0010440_0014840 as i said in the overview you're going to want to get as much as your way up on the front tires possible 
how_07012_0015700_0027290 we also want to get a spin in there so basically you come up the ramp and you want to get a little bit of a hop and in this way or this way whichever way you feel comfortable spending 
how_07012_0027910_0030960 it on the front tire squeezing the brake and rotating 
how_07012_0031480_0038530 when you've cleared the lip here a little bit that we don't roll back into it when you get right about fear that's when you want to let go of the break 
how_07012_0039100_0042870 we're also going to want a little bit of lean into your tire that we are momentum doesn't just tip you off 
how_07012_0042870_0053070 you want to enter the ramp a little bit and that will help with your rotating too 
how_07012_0053390_0057420 if you're going too fast you're going to fly up over the bars 
how_07012_0057820_0060790 if you're going to slow you're just going to slam your back tire down 
how_07012_0061520_0065320 petals always want to be in the three and nine i remember medium speed 
how_07084_0003150_0008390 today i'm going to be showing you how to a gourmet french fries cooked in duck fat 
how_07084_0008390_0014950 so we're currently heating up the oil at this point you're gonna want to be very very careful unless you render the duck fat yourself 
how_07084_0015170_0019720 i bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat 
how_07084_0020760_0023360 so what's happening as you'll see all the bubbles on top right there 
how_07084_0023890_0034360 the moisture that's the water actually coming out of the oil and which means it was probably improperly stored at the store or was allowed to partially thorn in the refrigerator 
how_07084_0034360_0037730 so i'm going to go until they don't see any bubbles in there 
how_07084_0038300_0040150 i do have it a little hotter than usual 
how_07084_0040150_0041810 but three for the right now i want to get to three twenty 
how_07084_0041810_0046980 five so i was going to turn down a little bit back off some while only from these bubbles to come out 
how_07084_0046980_0048770 but like i said be really really careful 
how_07084_0048820_0051820 already popped on me twice really really big 
how_07084_0051940_0058970 by two foot high oil explosions so just be really careful makes you don't bring your house down which you don't bring yourself 
how_07138_0000440_0009450 and we're going to stringer put our string around the perimeter and mark the love we each ant foot round locations 
how_07138_0010410_0030160 soon our running the string and string always makes a straight line so it's very handy for very handy for determining the strip the straight lines and then from the straight line you can determine the offset to make your curve 
how_07138_0030230_0034050 i'm going to pull the string pretty tight right here too 
how_07138_0035200_0049040 we want to make sure that the string doesn't doesn't move as as we lay cloth over the top of it 
how_07138_0051150_0053910 so there we have are rough sale perimeter 
how_07138_0055080_0062990 so again with a pushpin come down about fifty percent and in this case we're going to be three inches of home 
how_07138_0065280_0071630 in a larger cruising genoa you may you may want to use up to about nine inches of leach home 
how_07138_0073130_0076760 model each i use will also depend on the kind of cloth or using 
how_07138_0077120_0079260 i said moreover racing oriented say 
how_07138_0079260_0083290 can run a lot less leach hollow because the cloth is so much stiffer 
how_07138_0083830_0091130 in the case of these days sales were using a four point one ounce cruise in slashed to sail in cloth from challenge 
how_07138_0091540_0096800 so if you look along as edge here now we have to segmented straight lines 
how_07138_0097200_0099420 what kind of approximating a curve 
how_07138_0099480_0110760 it 's still just straight lines but we have a much better general idea of where the very edge of the sale is going to be in were not laying out more cloth and we need to 
how_07138_0111390_0116780 along the foot again we're going to go about fifty percent 
how_07138_0118420_0126790 where we put this pushpin will also determine where we're going to put the foot take up seem 
how_07138_0127700_0132050 go for about five inches and foot round like i said 
how_07138_0135150_0142550 so pleased to push fan about five inches off the off the straight line foot 
how_07138_0142790_0150160 we have a segmented line and we will transform this into a curve with the loft in bad 
how_07160_0001590_0009430 another we've covered walk in property let's work on an eu focusing on one point so we're actually moving or we're moving up the body as we go 
how_07160_0010020_0020120 one point if you can look at the center of mass is going to be belly button anywhere from two to three inches down dependent so right about where this boat 
how_07160_0021490_0033030 now one point is the principle of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place 
how_07160_0033640_0039390 one way of thinking of it is that if you have somebody its tensile strength 
how_07160_0039940_0054640 and if you have somebody grab onto your arm there ought to be a living breathing connection that yes you there it feels very strong it feels like a fire hose 
how_07160_0055300_0058550 fire hoses almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it 
how_07160_0058850_0064860 living entity and therefore one point is very much the same thing it is living entity 
how_07160_0065360_0071760 and you are looking for that constant relaxed natural power of tensile strength 
how_07160_0072260_0082430 not muscular by any means and it is certainly not structural it but there is well i shouldn't say that because there is an aspect of structural to it 
how_07160_0083360_0089360 with correct structure and correct relaxation you build on on tensile strength 
how_07160_0089750_0093680 and we will continue on this subject and shortly thereafter 
how_07395_0001440_0005340 the principles of aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations 
how_07395_0006790_0009730 it can be applied in your family with your spouse with your kids 
how_07395_0010180_0013520 can be applied at work if at an irate boss or coworkers 
how_07395_0013520_0015530 could be upset drivers 
how_07395_0015530_0016870 it could be something with road rage 
how_07395_0017190_0023430 we're going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques just to emphasize the principles and we just take a peek 
how_07395_0023480_0033410 for example if there's somebody coming at you with road rage is probably best not to to block not to stop them with your car but just to let him go right by with a look something like this 
how_07395_0033650_0036410 showing 
how_07395_0040960_0043980 so that's one way you can just let them go right by 
how_07395_0043980_0049130 if you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this 
how_07395_0055250_0061470 that that last technique as phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction 
how_07395_0061470_0063190 we can see exactly what they're seeing 
how_07395_0063660_0065910 we can get a little different perspective 
how_07395_0066320_0072990 we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately 
how_07395_0073160_0076820 as he attacks his turn 
how_07395_0077880_0079840 if everything is blending and harmonizing 
how_07395_0080160_0081600 some can be a little bit more direct 
how_07395_0081630_0083800 others can just not connect with that energy 
how_07395_0083800_0087660 if it's negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it 
how_07395_0087660_0094520 it has many different ways as you can see to to deal with each individual situation and principles will help you deal with that in daily life 
how_07449_0000550_0000940 
how_07449_0010720_0013600 i'd like to tell you about the wire that i use 
how_07449_0014090_0022360 the wire for the bracelets right here are twenty four gauge wire 
how_07449_0022390_0027190 comes in a school of twenty five yards and i just buy it at walmart 
how_07449_0027930_0029760 and this is the twenty four gauge 
how_07449_0030070_0033850 q you can use twenty six gauge twenty eight games 
how_07449_0033850_0036510 are thinner easy to crochet 
how_07449_0036930_0044550 twenty two gauge twenty gauge is really stiff and it's it's really hard to crochet 
how_07449_0044550_0046160 some of the candy with crochet 
how_07449_0046570_0053700 it comes in the silver and gold so you can choose whatever color you would like the project 
how_07449_0054130_0058690 you can also get it at the hardware store in a black color 
how_07449_0058740_0060430 this is a doll black color 
how_07449_0061280_0067270 this is a two thousand and four gauge its black if you would like that color 
how_07449_0067700_0070780 sometimes on the internet you can find different colors 
how_07449_0072160_0074970 used a black red pink 
how_07449_0075040_0079860 for this project and read or a green would be cute 
how_07449_0080180_0082420 we're just going to use the silver today 
how_07742_0000360_0001640 thrusters 
how_07742_0002190_0005710 right now we're going into a more complicated exercise 
how_07742_0006000_0007870 integrating more of the body 
how_07742_0008080_0015160 cameroon developed more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion 
how_07742_0015720_0015990 
how_07742_0015990_0018480 so jones and you want to go ahead and show thruster is 
how_07742_0019020_0022340 it doesn't take a couple of dumbbells bring them up to his shoulders 
how_07742_0022610_0025630 were basically he's going to sit back into a squat 
how_07742_0025630_0029520 and we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press but it's not that simple 
how_07742_0029520_0031210 not segmented like that 
how_07742_0031740_0032810 sit back 
how_07742_0032980_0041620 and as he drives up again driving on his heels drive and his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then forced the arms up 
how_07742_0042160_0042490 good 
how_07742_0042870_0047730 then there was a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbells right above his shoulders 
how_07742_0047880_0050480 and not out to decide not back but right above 
how_07742_0050990_0051640 good 
how_07742_0051640_0052530 good work jones 
how_07742_0053050_0061530 again work in from the heals up work with your breath fuel that your job and your hips forward and up each time good work 
how_07742_0061860_0068120 ten of those and then ruined sega three to five minute break and then come back to it 
how_07742_0068490_0075910 again i want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing thruster that is working from the ground up and it's one smooth movement 
how_07742_0076140_0077250 it 's not segment 
how_07742_0077320_0080210 not the squat and the shoulder press 
how_07742_0080620_0082000 one smooth movement 
how_07742_0083430_0083790 strike 
how_07815_0000290_0003510 we have some very good news for you about feral cats 
how_07815_0003840_0019390 in los angeles police department is now employ feral cats who otherwise would have been euthanized at shelters to fight rats and mice at two police station one the southeastern branch the other the central branch 
how_07815_0019600_0027490 and they report excellent success because once the rats and mice smelled the presence of the cats they flee 
how_07815_0027600_0029260 cats don't even have to chase them 
how_07815_0029960_0039590 it said that a parker center downtown la their main center there are now going to enjoy having a feral cats drive out the rats there 
how_07815_0039630_0043100 and you know i think this should be carried out around the country 
how_07815_0043100_0053820 wherever there's a problem was it be police departments are elsewhere because of feral cats do an excellent job and they otherwise i'm sorry to say would be youth 
how_07815_0054750_0058530 alpha south korea we have another case of cancer it's very interesting 
how_07815_0059000_0062770 and i've just cloned glow in the dark kiddies 
how_07815_0063050_0069840 yes they have given them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultra violet light 
how_07815_0070170_0074810 a very cute and of course people want to buy them their turkish and gore's 
how_07815_0075050_0080430 and ideas that this research may actually lead to cures for human disease 
how_07815_0080830_0083170 right now it's just a very cute idea 
how_07815_0083610_0084730 i say that 
how_07815_0085090_0089710 ha ha ha 
how_07913_0002630_0005860 and we're going to be learning how to play portal again by our software 
how_07913_0005920_0007870 a company with which i have no affiliation 
how_07913_0009220_0010270 all right 
how_07913_0010270_0012800 here we are in test chamber eight 
how_07913_0015220_0016910 some new icons here now 
how_07913_0016940_0024080 the old familiar power involved death power of all our conduits and now it looks like we've got some other ones 
how_07913_0024080_0027850 the risk of drowning and don't drink the water 
how_07913_0027880_0034460 so we look here and test chamber 
how_07913_0034460_0039070 we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic do 
how_07913_0039830_0043010 sort of toxic view that you wouldn't want to find yourself in 
how_07913_0043320_0048140 so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber eight at all costs 
how_07913_0048460_0055100 but look over here on our left we've got a powerboat spencer and an orange portal and power condiment 
how_07913_0055860_0065060 so what we need to do is find a way to get the powerball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit 
how_07913_0065830_0074110 but we need to be careful because if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the powerball we will die 
how_07913_0074690_0077990 so we need to find a different way of doing things 
how_07967_0000520_0003190 the line up for flashing wind to floss 
how_07967_0003860_0006440 people will vary in when they'd like to do it 
how_07967_0006610_0016750 most of the time what will find is that you'll flossed first then you'll do your tooth brushing then you'll do your tongue deep clacking and then rinsing after that 
how_07967_0017190_0023700 so when you're setting up for a year rum hygiene sessions but you want to do is you'll get everything out 
how_07967_0023700_0025430 get your floss out as well 
how_07967_0025720_0031540 you want to begin by preparing your floss for the actual procedure 
how_07967_0032330_0045370 again usually what we have there is that you'll take about anywhere between twelve and eighteen inch piece of loss and if you are able to floss manually that is all you would need

how_08072_0017530_0033990 traditionally the silicone gel filled implants have been the preference of most plastic surgeons because of the qualities of the gel in that there is better cohesiveness and softness possibly less rippling and a more natural feel to the implant 
how_08072_0035060_0046810 what happened was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two the silicone gel implants were taken off the market because there was concerned that the silicone gel would potentially leak out of the implant and then cause diseases in the body 
how_08072_0048080_0078970 sixteen years later just a few years ago it was decided to allow them to be released back onto the market again with certain restrictions in that people would have to make sure to follow certain guidelines as with being only over a twenty two to have silicone gel filled breast implants and then having an mri which is a special type of x ray done later in the future to make sure that there was no problem with the implant

how_08706_0056790_0063760 chimps service suffering from cancer 
how_08895_0004100_0009630 everybody so let me share with you some other ideas that you can use in a complete routine 
how_08895_0009730_0012000 i did a lot of them with you 
how_08895_0012800_0020580 if any of the tricks that we've talked about any of the principles that we've talked about with a svengali deck you can certainly use in a routine 
how_08895_0020960_0024300 put something together that you think is entertaining 
how_08895_0024610_0028180 one thing i did want to talk about is 
how_08895_0028180_0035610 if you're going to do this this is kind of interesting what you want to do is get a queen of clubs that's normal 
how_08895_0036840_0050800 we want to stick it on top of your deck and then you want to have them pick a card like this and then you're gonna pull a normal queen of clubs right off the top of the deck ok because you don't want to use one of your own one of your cut short cards for this 
how_08895_0051120_0063350 then you could tear this up and make it vanish using any of the methods we talked about some of the other card videos and you could produce another one from your pocket 
how_08895_0063350_0064910 another idea you could use 
how_08895_0065800_0073420 you could do this whole routine that we talked about with all the cards looking the same and everything and then have a prediction sealed envelope 
how_08895_0073720_0082420 don 't be afraid to combine a bunch of stuff i've showed you and you some of your own ideas as well to create a foreign routine that you can do for your friends and family 
how_08895_0083330_0084940 have fun with a svengali deck 
how_08900_0003450_0011270 another very good use although a slightly more risky use of awaiting wedge is carrying a backboard across moving car 
how_08900_0012370_0022700 while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationary and study in a way this is a last resort so you can use 
how_08900_0023460_0032250 we need a lot of people the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where its position in the middle 
how_08900_0032830_0041270 head should be at the front so that way if the feet get dropped into the water the water will tend to plain the blackboard up to the surface of the water 
how_08900_0042860_0050760 about old times during this way you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the blackboard 
how_08900_0051100_0058010 if at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board 
how_08900_0058010_0067080 if you have the opportunity to do this that person should be facing downstream over them in a better position to maintain the airway 
how_09149_0007970_0011250 if you look out on the market you're gonna find a lot of different types of equipment 
how_09149_0011580_0016130 for two big ones i want to talk about though right now or metal versus plastic 
how_09149_0016330_0019420 if you remember to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat 
how_09149_0019630_0026130 typically if you find metal processors you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better 
how_09149_0026430_0029060 we also want to look for good mixing as well 
how_09149_0029320_0037530 but also because we are dealing with a flammable substance from ethanol it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tank 
how_09149_0037630_0046280 also if your heating within the tank you don't want your tanked melton yet so i i can recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks 
how_09149_0046620_0053360 do your research look hard but look look for the plastic looked for the metal see which ones work the best for you 
how_09149_0053420_0060930 again calling it referrals but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with with metal tanks 
how_09372_0000600_0008020 what i'm going to be performing here is called a front squad now that traditional squat usually see the bar behind the neck 
how_09372_0008490_0010680 this is in front of your body 
how_09372_0010680_0012530 is going to be laying on your shoulders 
how_09372_0013370_0018690 cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold 
how_09372_0019570_0022620 now the first word develops year tear drop 
how_09372_0022680_0024060 what we call it at the gym 
how_09372_0024310_0027820 which is the front part of your claws that's neither kneecap 
how_09372_0028580_0032500 we want to go down with the bar come up 
how_09372_0033170_0037200 but again it's just like the squat and when a push from the heels 
how_09372_0037810_0041330 keep your body steady throughout the whole flow 
how_09372_0042960_0050540 about depending on the amount of what you're doing to go we will have you want to do about eight to ten reps 
how_09372_0051180_0055570 going through a light you want to do about ten to thirteen 
how_09372_0056930_0066580 again the first why they're going to cost a lot on the front part next to the niqab to help develop those better 
how_09372_0067780_0070490 and that's how you perform the francois 
how_09385_0000980_0001350 below 
how_09385_0001540_0005410 my name is john stewart and this is how to select an area for setting up a team 
how_09385_0006000_0010840 first thing you want to look for when setting up a tent in a as you want to look for flat ground 
how_09385_0011300_0015300 flat ground is going to be key to getting the nice solid platform setting up your team 
how_09385_0015890_0025150 we don't want to find low lying areas where there's holes valleys anything like that because water will pull up if it rains and it can leak into your team 
how_09385_0026240_0029300 a third thing is you don't want to find real rooted areas 
how_09385_0029300_0031180 we don't want to put it in public trails 
how_09385_0031530_0033080 quantifying clear areas 
how_09385_0033150_0036410 that you won't have to move later when setting 
how_09385_0037210_0039340 also you want to look for widow makers 
how_09385_0039760_0045650 winter makers are logs dead trees anything like that they could possibly fall in your teen during the night 
how_09385_0046640_0053010 these could leave you really really hurt at night if something like this did happen so you want to try to avoid all these things 
how_09385_0053390_0057670 and lastly you want to find an area that is near other people 
how_09385_0058090_0061800 public shelters and stuff like that just in case of an emergency 
how_09385_0062470_0066040 and this is john stuart on how to select an area for setting up a team 
how_09473_0001460_0006660 i got my first job back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four on a tv series called miami vice 
how_09473_0007510_0011000 they were down in miami filming locally of course where the series was shot

how_09473_0023720_0026640 so i went in not knowing what to expect really 
how_09473_0026970_0029440 this is my first introduction to it and i got sides

how_09738_0069060_0071800 and that is a claridge cocktail 
how_09738_0071860_0072360 bottoms up 
how_09758_0000370_0005350 this clip we're going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise 
how_09758_0005760_0008850 a number one last for these birds his flight 
how_09758_0009500_0013140 these guys are finally beginning to be really careful if you have them loose in your household 
how_09758_0013470_0015540 a lot of these birds aren't team 
how_09758_0015800_0017690 people get them and they just have two or three of them 
how_09758_0018010_0023180 as your opening up the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away 
how_09758_0023210_0025670 when they panic they fly and they don't come back 
how_09758_0025720_0026920 flat your windows 
how_09758_0026920_0028520 will fly out your front door 
how_09758_0028520_0038020 will be think that everything sealed and you go to clean the papers in your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that verges flies right out 
how_09758_0038020_0042360 can be very very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flight 
how_09758_0042360_0045090 it seems to be the number one way to lose 
how_09758_0045090_0048370 once they get loose outside predators get to them very quickly 
how_09758_0048510_0054280 these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they don't survive 
how_09758_0054850_0058270 the other divisions and worry about is teflon pan 
how_09758_0058270_0067810 if their heat into a high temperature and give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them to basically fell off their perch dead 
how_09758_0067810_0070260 there 's nothing you can do about it and it's very quickly 
how_09758_0070260_0071770 it's kind of a silent killer 
how_09758_0072800_0079670 so if you have them in the kitchen if you're going to cook with teflon with them to another room in the house so that you can protect them 
how_09758_0080010_0093310 parcels spring for bugs spring perfumes around the house on all those sorts of things these parts have very very sensitive upper respiratory tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol can irritate on their lungs 
how_09758_0093310_0096890 these guys only have a few breaths before though die 
how_09758_0096890_0100640 so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house 
how_09758_0101020_0115760 and lastly there so so tiny so basically anything your house a dog a cat anything they can get switched into door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or your cat where your kid they'll just squish 
how_09758_0115760_0119570 so there's not a whole lot to them they're not that robust they're mostly feathers 
how_09758_0119570_0122860 so have to be fairly careful with these birds 
how_09758_0122860_0125540 at least in a in a physical way 
how_09758_0125900_0129170 those are most of your household dangers 
how_09758_0129170_0134020 again if you're cooking in the birds loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan 
how_09758_0134300_0138010 we don't want toilet seats open if they're flying around your house because they could fly in and drowned 
how_09758_0138830_0145200 be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house 
how_09758_0145200_0147790 and make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked out for 
how_09758_0148120_0158760 and if they're alone in their cages just make sure that your other pets if it's a smaller cage cannot their cage over in either let the birds fly out or they can't reach through the viruses 
how_09758_0158760_0163850 like a cat might and dig through the bars that small enough and be able to grab ahold of the bird 
how_09758_0164350_0173960 and if the birds outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine reckons have been known to break into their cages tear through the bars and rip into these guys 
how_09758_0173960_0178410 so you've got to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time 
how_09758_0178820_0186590 more or less covers just be careful remember your birds very small and sensitive much more sensitive to chemicals than many other pets are 
how_09919_0001050_0005150 follow the j b with asr homebrew supply in austin texas 
how_09919_0006270_0015310 talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home 
how_09919_0015710_0017790 wine or cider socks 
how_09919_0017870_0020580 he got a lot of different things you can make here 
how_09919_0020580_0021020 so 
how_09919_0021670_0039980 one of the things you want to do at the end of or during the process of making beer especially bear making or even wine is you need a rack or transfer some strange terminology nerve wracking means to transfer from point a to point b 
how_09919_0040440_0052210 so especially if they're making la times you're moving hot liquids from one point to another especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point 
how_09919_0052210_0058520 what 's going to be really difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it 
how_09919_0058560_0080050 so so that being said we carry food grade pumps that the reason their food grade is there's a space between where the motor housing is in the actual pump drive with a magnetic drive between 
how_09919_0080480_0086400 a complete difference between the motor and where the actual liquid comes through 
how_09919_0086710_0088580 subsequently its food grade 
how_09919_0088610_0099180 in other words there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleum lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here 
how_09919_0099180_0099480 said 
how_09919_0100030_0102300 these guys are called food grade palms 
how_09919_0102560_0117040 and made by a company called march and these guys do a great job of moving hot boiling were or beer from point a to point b without having to pick up big kettles full of hot boiling liquid 
how_09919_0117070_0117510 so 
how_09919_0118090_0121300 food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing 
how_09996_0000880_0006560 began here dotted now art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as the daughter 
how_09996_0007000_0013810 stylists comes with different sized round it ends on it anywhere ranging from very small two very large 
how_09996_0014410_0018730 but there's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do 
how_09996_0018900_0033010 for a very small intricate design like an eye you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have whereas if you're wanting to do something large such as facade and you're going to want to use the largest you have 
how_09996_0033630_0039790 also sizes if you want it to do things like buttons or just small designed like that 
how_09996_0040300_0046590 for your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting 
how_09996_0046670_0056980 i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen 
how_10017_0008230_0013000 one of the ways that i continued to create my sound is i use what's called a loop station 
how_10017_0013400_0027950 in a loop station is basically live recording that's an exile our input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have that goes into the loop station in what you do is you press basically a pedal and it starts to record 
how_10017_0028340_0041350 when you press the pedal again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience and in doing so you can create mean sound with a lot of stuff layered over top of it 
how_10017_0041650_0052420 be very creative it's a very creative way to to show people what you're about to help facilitate really what your music is about creating a sound onstage 
how_10017_0052740_0060920 people really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to to broaden your musical horizons 
how_10199_0000060_0004800 i'm going to show you how to make a raspberry sun splashed wonderfully fruity cocktail 
how_10199_0004800_0006920 we 're going to start off with our eyes 
how_10199_0007560_0008480 like so 
how_10199_0008690_0017580 for that into your glass and then we're going to add to that three fourths of an ounce of coconut room any brand will do so choose your favorite 
how_10199_0017650_0019460 one drinking it and i want you to like it 
how_10199_0020060_0023670 we 're going to add three fourths of an ounce of raspberry li cor 
how_10199_0024650_0025340 he just likes 
how_10199_0025340_0027440 it 's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor 
how_10199_0027570_0030730 and as is our peach tree snobs 
how_10199_0031420_0034380 so three fourths of an answer equal parts 
how_10199_0035340_0039410 when we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine 
how_10199_0040630_0043030 those legs so 
how_10199_0043390_0047420 about an ounce of orange juice 
how_10199_0047420_0051850 and they were going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice 
how_10199_0053610_0056430 this is going to be so wonderfully tropical 
how_10199_0058470_0059380 since the name sons 
how_10199_0059380_0065110 flash shaken 
how_10199_0065240_0067450 if you have a hurricane glass great 
how_10199_0067480_0070640 if not you can also serve this in a highball glasses 
how_10199_0074120_0082070 garnish with cherry and there you have it raspberry sun splashed 
how_10199_0082070_0082540 for years 
how_10374_0000070_0011300 now i've taught you on the leg and pass series but i'm going to go over it again discussing more the structure of learning body throws in preparation for learning things like bat crosses over the shoulders and penguin catches 
how_10374_0012170_0025600 now as i talked about in the last clip you need to practice getting the trip down one at a time and it's very important to keep good posture and good head position and not be scrambling all over the place to make your catch 
how_10374_0026100_0032270 now always start with one object and for on the leg always remember to bring a leg up to you 
how_10374_0032470_0042430 if you start to lean towards your leg your tendency to be either the throw out or you won't be able to see what's coming down so you can catch it 
how_10374_0043020_0055720 if you bring your leg up to you it takes more energy from the waist town but you can work your agility and it will also make the throw and catch much worry it's much easier 
how_10374_0057890_0069450 when learning to put them all together with any body throw you want to have a structured practice 
how_10374_0069890_0092090 in short controlled runs as i've mentioned before a very important but also the pattern which you throw them every third throw jugglers tennis maybe every third throw alternating 
how_10374_0094240_0097290 you can mix up the pattern but it's important to get it down 
how_10374_0097680_0102810 you may also want to practice your balance with under the leg by just doing it constantly on one side 
how_10374_0102940_0107470 this is a whole different trick but it may help with some things 
how_10397_0006230_0010380 beatniks consumption is that the dog's tail is wagging that he's had 
how_10397_0011080_0017940 while the dog wag their tails when they are about to attack as well so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail 
how_10397_0017940_0022710 if his tail is tucked then he's afraid and that you should not be petting him at that time 
how_10397_0023390_0027610 and never pet dogs afraid because it will just make them more afraid 
how_10397_0027890_0030490 if it is laying like this and this is just normal 
how_10397_0030790_0035350 when he wagged his tail and it's about here in the middle that's happy that's a normal state of mind 
how_10397_0035780_0044860 and when the tail starts to go out and using wagging like this that's when you can tell them yourselves in a more oppressive state of mind 
how_10397_0045050_0055400 another thing about dogs when you walk into a lot of times to see their ears perk up their ears perk up in an assistant paying more attention 
how_10397_0055400_0071400 but you can see a lot of time that they will get isn't tedsters in their fixating on something and as soon as their fixating on something that's when you need to correct that because that's being obsessed with that object whether it be a person or another dog or anything like that 
how_10397_0071430_0080270 so it's ok for dogs to be curious what if the sphere 
how_10468_0000440_0008300 we're going to work on an arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you 
how_10468_0008300_0009670 call it painting the walls 
how_10468_0010440_0018700 so this one what you're going to start with let's take one hand first it's going to the risks is going to come down and the rest is going to come up 
how_10468_0018700_0025940 so basically arrest is going to be leading the movement and let the fingers follow nice and relax where the wrist is going 
how_10468_0025980_0029650 don't let the fingers take over but the risk to all the guiding

how_10733_0013750_0023480 crying irons come in various diameter as they come very small you're half inch they go to three quarter inch the one inch the one and a half inch and then that too 
how_10733_0023530_0028330 the water the larger the diameter of the use of the wave is going to be 
how_10733_0028470_0033410 when somebody like heathers hair you also must take into consideration the length of her hair 
how_10733_0033660_0048130 if i was to use this on this section it would only do one term it will be very very loose and he would do something like this are shorter here just to kind of give a little devil around the face 
how_10733_0048260_0055640 scientists agree that kind of get the hair to either go under or flip out the smaller diameter or s on her hair 
how_10733_0055890_0061410 another great benefit with a criteria such as this one is it does have a heat adjustment on it 
how_10733_0061490_0066340 adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order cater to your hair

how_10753_0001150_0006970 so we've been working on directional rolling and as we've discussed we are talking about five degree incremental 
how_10753_0007550_0016250 well as five degree incremental increase you can't roll down the long part of your body anymore 
how_10753_0017290_0020610 we have to start changing the angle as the angle increases 
how_10753_0021160_0025390 so in the closer you get to ninety degrees the more you have to be going across your shoulders 
how_10753_0026040_0033040 so as it approaches ninety degrees regardless because it's essentially a forward role until you hit ninety degrees 
how_10753_0033040_0039930 we 're just getting used to the idea of falling from an aspect that you're not used to 
how_10753_0040300_0050880 so if this is my zero line and that's my ninety degrees at forty five you're still essentially doing a forward role but there's more on the shoulder 
how_10753_0051750_0056380 and as i said as it approaches ninety you're moving more across the shoulders 
how_10753_0056380_0058890 so how do we do this with killing ourselves 
how_10753_0060850_0068390 we started the same way we started the break for more of the beginnings of break for in which the leg goes back 
how_10753_0068670_0069040 k 
how_10753_0069910_0073390 now ladies going to go back but it's only going to go to the other leg 
how_10753_0073670_0075630 or you can also stretch it out 
how_10753_0075660_0078680 i prefer to stretch it out it gets closer to the ground faster 
how_10753_0079440_0087750 so what happens is going to stretch it out lean into it go ahead and touch the floor 
how_10753_0088660_0095440 we're going to use a slight kick off with this leg to give yourself some projection into them into the side direction 
how_10753_0096150_0098140 a number zero ninety degrees 
how_10753_0098550_0100210 why should be able to see the whole time 
how_10753_0100440_0113710 so it's across the back across the shoulders but your instead of going across your body you're having to go across your wingspan and your shoulder blades 
how_10875_0003600_0009960 from sweet sixteen studio and i'm here to talk to you about soundproofing for a recording studio 
how_10875_0011050_0016150 would like to go over a few points about the air conditioning system that i've installed in this studio 
how_10875_0016980_0022940 first of all located the air conditioner on the roof as far away from the studio as possible 
how_10875_0022990_0025370 in fact it's darn here on the other side of the house 
how_10875_0026160_0028960 i say my house because my house attached to the other side 
how_10875_0029230_0030680 it 's over on the side of the house 
how_10875_0030760_0033730 pipes come in the dumps come in the studio 
how_10875_0033730_0039710 reason is self explanatory really you want to keep that sound noise out your studio 
how_10875_0040290_0050620 good point is to budget permitting if you can install an air conditioner there is a much larger than the one that you really need 
how_10875_0050960_0059000 is a thousand square feet and i have an air conditioner on the roof that can cool four thousand square feet 
how_10875_0059620_0075470 a recent being runs much less it's way more efficient at quieter because i hear them installer three speed fan so i can turn fan way down low and air just trickles in can hardly here 
how_10875_0076060_0079200 that way you can keep cool and record at the same time 
how_10875_0080340_0085590 ok i'm showing you the air conditioning vents inside the studio now 
how_10875_0085590_0093930 bears eight of them in this particular studio and i just want to make a point that you don't need to put those air conditioning greats over them 
how_10875_0094540_0100610 it 's better to leave those off and in fact they cost like thirty bucks each you can save yourself some bucks there 
how_10875_0101140_0110130 but leave him off so that your air just comes drifting in nice in quietly and it's not obstructed by those grace they normally put on ac unit 
how_10875_0110160_0116910 what i did there was took some foil tape and went around the edge to make it look pretty 
how_10875_0116910_0119450 no i hope you think it looks pretty to me it does 
how_10923_0000700_0005580 one of the most important things about drawing are coming up with ideas is having a sketchbook 
how_10923_0005610_0008550 and that's a place where you can draw whatever it is that you want 
how_10923_0008550_0010700 and you don't have to worry about whether or not it looks good 
how_10923_0010700_0015690 sketchbook isn't a place that you keep all your best drawings or even any good drawings 
how_10923_0015970_0018870 it 's just where you doodle ideas you just kind of let your pin flow 
how_10923_0018870_0020200 we don't have to worry about 
how_10923_0020450_0021850 it 's like your personal diary 
how_10923_0022100_0024740 so i just want to flip through this is my actual sketchbook 
how_10923_0025020_0029570 some studies in here and some of it looks good looks on finish 
how_10923_0029840_0032140 i mean a lot of it doesn't make any sense 
how_10923_0032170_0040330 it is an actual study of this and sometimes i'm just messing around and doing whatever i feel like and have beautiful aren't like this that's quality 
how_10923_0040360_0045290 i can put that my sketchbook and nobody is going to judge me in the art world because it's my sketchbook and i can put one on one 
how_10923_0045680_0058540 so first you have to get a sketchbook then you have to just scribble all over it so that there is nothing that's keeping you nothing that's blocking you from letting out whatever idea is that inside you that you want to get on paper 
how_10923_0058810_0070290 and you have to be able to be comfortable scribbling in his sketchbook before you're going to be comfortable drawing on an actual drawing there isn't an expensive piece of paper that means something to you that it's going to be a piece of art in the end 
how_10930_0000360_0019830 foot placement required for switchboard slide is very similar to the foot placement for the regular for its line just picture everything backwards the only difference is going to be is they imagine you're getting into a switch front side when eighty because the foot position needed is very similar to that 
how_10930_0019830_0026610 what you're going to do is hang the tip of your tell over the board or the tip of your heel and just a big toe 
how_10930_0027220_0033490 the reason for this is that you need to get a ninety degree switch on and this is going to help you push the board in that direction 
how_10930_0034210_0052020 another foot as to be right behind the trucks and the reason for this is so that when you get into the switchboard slide it ends up being about right here that's the only way you're going to be able to get out of the board slide because if you have your foot on the tail so that you could put the wait to get out of the switchboard slide 
how_10930_0052920_0070330 so remember similar to a switch front side when eighty and imagine with any switch trick it's like turning it around and doing it the other way so if you already know how to do a board slide just imagine a mirror image of the foot placement that's needed and you can imagine how it will be for the foot placement switchboard slide 
how_11433_0007400_0011410 how can i create great sponsorships from my after them and you cry 
how_11433_0011410_0014540 when the words because that's exactly what the segments about

how_11525_0022550_0036590 but the important thing that you never want to do it starts a cruise pushing around longer its associated with your front foot tall we throw your direction often send in all sorts of places you don't want to go 
how_11525_0036940_0045550 because remember as i said in the first series aiming your front foot pretty much the determining factor in the direction that you're gonna go in 
how_11525_0045550_0058620 so when you push mongo like this name with your back would soon as you him back on the board you might be able to go in the direction you want to go in but more often than not somewhere that you don't want to go 
how_11525_0059250_0068830 but screws around get a feel for your board feel for the ground for he started trying tricks and he can just move forward 
how_11536_0003210_0005750 and today we're going to learn how to set up a drum kit

how_11536_0040500_0043790 seafood hid it from here there's a possibility that it gets it 
how_11536_0043990_0044820 we settled there 
how_11536_0044860_0047120 it 's a good place right now for it 
how_11536_0047420_0048720 and now i have to extend it 
how_11536_0049860_0058380 so we can take this loosen it titan 
how_11536_0059360_0060840 would receive all in this right now 
how_11536_0060970_0062850 we will have to definitely adjust 
how_11536_0062850_0066410 you can take to some extent a little bit more 
how_11536_0069070_0073150 and then this is the boom and then this is the head 
how_11536_0073150_0087230 will loosen go ahead loosened both of those and get the head to where you think it's close enough to an angle of the angle and then the boom and titan 
how_11536_0087230_0091510 the tickets were just eyeballing 
how_11536_0091510_0092420 i think that 
how_11536_0092420_0094530 is pretty close for right now 
how_11600_0000330_0002630 i am danny back in from laughing dog farm 
how_11600_0003120_0005550 today i'm going to talk to you a little bit about mixing soil 
how_11600_0006150_0012850 so to produce large numbers of beautiful food seedlings early in the season we need some good soil 
how_11600_0013360_0021550 and there's a lot to the science of soil but you might know that it's also an art as much as a science 
how_11600_0021890_0036470 so we're going to be mixing various ingredients into this wheelbarrow to come up with the most rich potting soil that we can to give these valuable heirloom vegetable seedlings extremely fast and robust start 
how_11600_0037550_0039450 so what do we need to know about mixing soil 
how_11600_0040050_0046280 well essentially soil is made of clay silt and sand three different sized particles 
how_11600_0046660_0055590 depending on the combination of the clay silt and sand in your soil you're going to have a soil at either is well drained are not so well drained or downright waterlogged 
how_11600_0056120_0065130 good soil is a combination of of particle sizes so you have your say and you have your silt you have your clay and then you have organic matter 
how_11600_0065850_0075340 when we make soil we're going to want to bring into the equation organic matter nutrients in the form of manure compost and then something to bulk it up 
how_11600_0075540_0079480 something to give a body that the plants can grow and send their routine 
how_11748_0000710_0004700 so i'm going to take these hands over and go ahead impress them down 
how_11748_0004750_0008520 and i'm going to show you how we're going to mark were really cut off the pants 
how_11748_0008520_0015360 solos cover your to my work table slash earning table 
how_11748_0015490_0023420 so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and earnest down just like i did the other leg just kind of pull it a tiny bit if we go 
how_11748_0023420_0026810 with our right here along the same 
how_11748_0027230_0038280 like i said before i like doing that just because i know the fabric is right we're supposed to be you give it that we will press 
how_11748_0039280_0040350 sign 
how_11748_0041080_0048290 i 'm going to open it up and get that crease that put me 
how_11748_0048290_0052160 i want to do the enzyme also 
how_11748_0052160_0060730 we 've already done that's what some 's gonna get after it do it 
how_11748_0062540_0074760 so now that i have this press still going to go ahead and flipped these pants back out because only to see that makes us fabrics are can determine where i'm going to cut it off 
how_11748_0075420_0076790 came here we go 
how_11748_0077260_0084830 and when i do this if i have to cover the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric on the inside 
how_11748_0084830_0091600 there is a good idea just in case say someone else wants to wear alone or you know they'll have a little bit to work 
how_11748_0091600_0097550 if they need to let him because you can still wears the pants out to have some original him left 
how_11748_0098000_0106270 so i'm going to start right here we're up with that one little seen that also myself in look on it
