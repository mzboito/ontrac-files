i will come back 
in this segment we're going to be discussing how to make the client comfortable on the side tables 
so in this case we're working with a massage table other individuals are there and i chaired bad yoel deal with that as it presents itself to you 
so milan you care to demonstrate with 
have you first said green

america 
first ghana table like this and then we have them swing their legs under the table gray 
then slowly lower yourself supporting her back in her hand

by judy carrier with jewels by park lane and i want to tell you how to clean your sterling silver jewelry 
first volley foot a pot of water on to boil just like you would if you're having a baby in the old movies 
he had a glass pot or a an aluminum pammy than one will work 
if you have a glass potter something just fill out of line it with aluminum foil just plain aluminum foil that you use on the turkey 
then take some baking soda and sprinkled liberally over the hump the foil 
put your jewelry and there 
set it in and then you pour the hot water over it 
it 's gonna fears up smells like rotten eggs and it's not the nicest smelling 
we let it sit there a while until it's completely dissolve and you might want to shake the panel little or just start to make sure that the baking powder is completely dissolved 
while that is claiming you may want to air out the windows or something that opened a window get that smell out 
pour the water off when it's quit fizzing and take it out rented and pat it dry with a lint free cloth and your joy should look as good as new 
beauty carrier withdrawals by park lane and that's how you clean sterling silver jewelry 
how does a snake grow 
well it's a good question 
snakes growers kind of different way than we do 
people shed scale skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around 
snakes scales are a little different they're more like an armor coating on the outside and then it will allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like dragged down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake well not really too much of a baby anymore 
what they do is they they they rubbed their head against something here's the head over here 
how to get something to split their skin and then slowly rode off some kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out 
when it comes off and its inside out 
and you can actually see all the individual little scales on the top and you can see all the belly skills and the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snakes 
baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really berries as to how often they are going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they're growing 
obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they're going to shed a lot less but they do you still need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales repair any damage their male occurred and and continue on with their healthy life 
and next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension headache is happening 
my hair back so that you can see this little bit easier 
while that's going to happen as you're going to be seeded in your easy seated posts again with your citizens on the floor or on a block 
we 're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches so that you're sitting tall but you're not going to be propped this way 
if you're sitting this way than to relax your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine that the crowd of your head is still reaching 
inhale and then as you exhale just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder 
notice how my shoulders stone creep up as i drove off the air down there 
stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine and an axe haley to just shut my writer toward the right shoulder taken 
couple press here inhaling and exhaling and then in and out through the nose remember and then 
exhale you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest again when 
we 're here the shoulders aren't creeping up their stone 
melting down on either side of the spine you're going 
inhale think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades and exhale secrets 
with three part breath into the belly into the rib cage and then into the heart 
in hell you're going on the left here come over toward love shoulder notice again 
the right shoulders and going to pop up and the left shoulder current to support the area and just keep 
them gently falling down so it 
and you're going to breathe here slowly 
began to connect these movements acts hailing as you drop the in chen toward the chest and healing as the air also towards the shoulder blade and do this as long as you're comfortable and safe 
at least twenty repetitions 
keep it going for a minute that scrape stick with the breathless 
breastfeeding emphasis for every movement and ever let yourself give the breath away 
falling thinking the game 
from the standpoint tonight with covered a lot information 
basically about the stance we've talked about how to move the ball through the stans we've talked about release position we've talked about spare shooting we've talked about how to speed on the ball 
it gives me a lot of him for faith standpoint it's time to take information go out on the lanes to play with 
the first product and i'm going to talk to you about is the product called egyptian magic 
is one of my favorite things to use for hair skin lips soars everything 
great 
when it comes to this product the best quality that is that it's all natural ingredients 
and as you can see a kind of starts out looking like a wax but when you dig them out you just stick it in your hand and then a melt slowly and turns into oil 
this makes it really easy to massage into his scalp and to run through somebodies hair this i really like to use in pre treatment 
if you rebel lot of this throughout the hair it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and keeps it moisturize throughout the whole braiding process 
in that way it doesn't giant anytime in the middle but it's great for your skin 
it also after braiding style is complete it's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each brain 
we just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturize 
since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time 
ok 
fish has been in the oven for about twenty minutes so now it's time to take it out 
we can see the ground is still here and here's our fish packet 

but garlic still needs to cook 
iridium 
and we're just going to let 's sit here and crew and i like to call residual cooking 
they always do that when you take them out of the heat the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat 
best it's going to keep it moist and incredibly delicious texture soft texture 
meanwhile let's just quickly do our broccoli 
this is where we can take our knife and the broccoli and just cut the ends off of our fleurette like 
so just enough for two people is what we need 
do and if you if you have more than two people you're welcome to save the stems and ethan to have 
i happened to prefer just the broccoli 
threats and to this regard to go to the sikh so we can put an end 
water we just need a little bit of water here the bob just a little bit 
war and i'm going to put the broccoli florets in here 
so i'm going to cover them and then i'm going to put them on this vote here we go on with oil 
with high heat so just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming so it's not going to be overcoat such a great 
screen and i'm going to check them every once in a while but it takes about 
seven minutes to cook so keep clicking will get close 
in this section we're going to talk about full body movement 
so what i mean by full body movement from your upper body down your lower body 
upper body you don't want to be timid are shy i know it's going to feel a little silly if you don't really move your arms but you should really be moving your arms 
and the reason why you'll see the arm movement a lot especially as the intensity increases in let's say you come to that hill you really want to make sure you move your arms because you're now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body and you're getting more oxygen into your lungs and your breathing in the fresh air blowing it back out and full body movement 
as far as your lower body your legs you want to make sure that you put most of the way down your calves 
cc if i was running as running on put most of the weight on my calves and moving my body moving my arms and my shoulders 
in britain and through the nose bleed out through the mouth 
notice the difference the next time you run just remember in your mind what i said 
for more than you move your arms you're going to see yourself increasing speed and you're going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there were just very little movement 
do you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country running 

horrible moment 
if you can move on 



if you open 
he said 



once again this is something that we don't sell a whole lot of these days but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all at their stories chlorine 
this is a very good way of being able to test the level of chlorine that you have in your water 
that being said that's just a little bit about chlorine test papers 
ok now let's talk about turning the compost pile it's all good and you put this file together i don't have to turn the compost pile 
because if you layered it right and you ordered it right and you get your micro organisms and their you put the compost and not ruin their you shouldn't have to turn this fund 
obviously this is a brand new violet we just made today 
if for some reason your pile didn't cook down which mean if your pile is four feet high when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half 
in ancient cooked down it should go down and you should be able to see that it looks like campus not like this material 
if you come across your pile and it hasn't done those things then you're going to want to turn your pile 
the way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning 
we would play holes in the ground though would drain good 
we would create add some more stick which we've run out of 
we have plenty in the woods 
add your leafy your garden debris for variation and then 
would start to turn your pile 
take the top and you would put it on the bottom just like this and that 
my name is dave andrews 
demonstrated how to run a macro and excel from access 
began opening up excel 
first create our macro by clicking the view 
quantum macros and saying record macro 
with the name this macro on to say ok 
caused macros going to do is type the number one two three four across the top 
pro so stop recording by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record 
we have our macro created 
so let's save this as a macro enabled work 
click on your office burn 
savers 
we're going to say macro enabled work 
name it book one and just stay safe 
and our need to go and access by clicking the start button programs microsoft office 
it's open access 
we need to create a new database by clicking on the office burned and saying no 
was going to leave the name as database one and say create 
or a new database 
to run that macro from xl macro from access hold down the alt key on your keyboard 
preserve eleven 
which brings up the visual basic coated 
to the top 
say 
we're going to say module 
when are coded are going to begin taboo against go 
we have our function created an access i'm going to go over whether you're a quake 
first thing it does is it creates a variable called exhale and in the science itself 
to create object function launches a new excel application scheme 
but then opens up a excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that have typed in an inner simply says exhale that run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one 
linked to this function xl test within an object in your database 
one day rangers and i've just showed you how to run an excel macro from access 
this is john and in this clip will be talking about the portable shop table 
as you begin to accessorize your wood shop you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table 
will notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs and at the other side we just have our standard feet 
and now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily will it to the next station maybe you're going to a table saw or a planar 
now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic uncomfortable or if you're looking for more of a custom mobile workbench you can always go online and search for free mobile workbench plans and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself 
you'll notice that are workbench fear in the shop is made of metal 
now if the surface gets scratched it will scratch your lumber so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it goes gets scratched you could refinish it and make it smoothes again 
below 
by name is effort clark dahlberg from miami dog training 
in this clip we're gonna teach you how to walk a dog 
number one is what the leash 
sometimes you know people you're confident overconfident with their dog's leash and something spooks the dog sees a cat runs out into the street and that can cause problems 
so walking the dog number one should be done on the leash 
preferably a five to six foot leash 
i prefer five foot leash 
and the leather leash you tools are or your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog 
so walking with doug you always want to make sure that you are the leader year in the front 
so i'm going to show you an example of that right now 
she stays behind me 
if she's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next 
if she should be always looking for a cue from you 
so as you can see when i stop she sits and she's relaxed 
so when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled 
and i was walking on one side so they're not confused about going back and forth 
is africa dahlberg and this has been how to walk a dog 
first of all i want to tell you when you are doing business over the phone you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate 
what i'm talking about is no longer do you have any nonverbals to work 
on the other end of that phone that can't see your face that can't see your body they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment 
so basically all your left where is your tone of voice 
your attitude which comes through in your tone of voice and this is what you have to work with 
this is what will convey your professionalism 
this is what will convey your willingness to listen and to help and to be a professional 
so it's very important that we focus on the specific 
fluoride is a messiah stroke that it's basically just stroking the horse 
and you can do it either with your hands with your fingers clothes and just stroking down the side of the horse keeping one hand on the horse all the time or you're doing it 
you can have your fingers more open inserted a cone shape stroking down the side of the horse starting at the pole and working all the way back 
but it's actually a fairly safe stroke to use either form of flourish horses most likely they almost always enjoy it 
they don't find it to be too invasive it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the unless you're being really careless it's a fairly safe strove to be using 
so again i'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of calming on the horse or having your fingers clothes and stroking down the sides of the horse 
just patting them 
it 's a nice gentle stroke it helps them to relax 
i am jason 
so they were painting on glass 
we have put the first coat the liner and to fill in on all three of the steps 
look and blankets ready now to be so we can really start touching up the liner 
can really touching up the black 
we look at it we can see spots that that filled in and spots that didn't we don't have to worry about how these thick lines of the real really looks bad right now but we're just in the beginning stages so really 
we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect everywhere that we know they're going to need to and the all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to do so 
please take the angled brush back again the black back out and really the less paint you have on here to better just a very little on the tip of your brush discipline 
it needs to be filled in and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes were just 
and set the pain right on it phil 
just like that we don't win 
to do anything anymore 
feeding the purposeful just 
spread that paint thinner and thinner and just be frustrated in the end so this 
here and it is not touching 
please put a little dab of black their same as up here just basically 
everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in the white said 
patents and fill in everywhere you go to fill in a look at it and we'll wait for the right touch 
if the wind 
hi everybody i'm john grain from the martial arts teachers association and john graden dotcom 
how do you practice your kickboxing moves 
as a great question 
kickboxer this is one i'm particularly fond 
when here's a common mistake that people make when they're doing their kickboxing moves 
if i'm hitting the bag or i'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move 
will try and slammed the bag as hard as i can remember what happens when you do that is one you waste a lot of energy to tense the body up three tend to run out of gas faster 
if you don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how's that 
have techniques that i'm just going to snap that's going to pop out there so i'm like a snap snap snap and about every seventh or eighth or bad raw file and recover 
power so i'm mixing my snapping speed techniques with my power techniques to every time you step and so every time you saw technique you want to make sure your penetrating with your footwork and i was not standing in one spot dig a hole 
every time you throw your first move you always close the gap and your opponent calm in engage and then clear step out reopen the gap with a clearing technique electrically with a job or are clear with the front round cake 
so i engage step in fire fire fire clear and then here's the biggie change my alignment on the bag will target and then repeat the process 
so we're mixing are snapping techniques with our power techniques not just doing power all the time to every attack penetrating for work engage clearing footwork change your line that's always the pattern 
penetrate engage clear change alignment penetrate engage clear change your life 
make sure that that's the parents are developing in the ring in the gym so that when you're in the ring that's how you fight comes out 
john gray 
hope that helps 
thanks very much 

so i'm going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch 
here 's our rip and if you're doing a real repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment 
branches closely as possible but for purposes of showing you and so that you can see exactly what i'm doing and what the stitch looks like i'm going to use of black thread 
it should make it easier for you to see 
now start with you want to not your friend like i showed you the nice could not and we're going to come up from the back of the garment about a half an inch from the start of the rip 
we 're gonna come up in from the back to the front of the fabric and then you're going to make a deal go back in just a very small amount like centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch probably an eighth of an inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you'll go on the opposite side of it where you came out to go in and take again about an eighth somewhere between a quarter an eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider 
we're going to start very small and close a little wider a little wider and you'll see what we're going to get 
and here we go so now you're stitches started small bigger bigger and their straight up and down perpendicular to the rip about an eighth of an inch and go in down here 
and now we're were up to where the rip begins and we're going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter of an eighth of an inch stitches and now we're going to go across the rip we're going to enter here again 
about an eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip to 
as long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't it won't be coming out there 
we pull that through 
see how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rear and let me get a few more and then i'll show you what to do 
so then once we get a bunch of those and we're going to pull them very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together 
it almost looks like the same 
so the smaller the stitches the more delicate repair will be 
scimitars leone and scimitars another very powerful artifact equipment 
once again he had to put it in play and attach it to a creature through its equip cost to put this in the play and honor creature 
again isn't uncommon at the basic black 
once again the basic block is currently in tenth edition as we see from the icon 
an uncommon to me as a costume forty or fifty cents at your local gaming store 
leon instant scimitar caution you want to put them play in costume on a quick 
which means it costs you to take what creature 
well with this cause you're going to get a plus one plus one on targeted creature which doesn't seem that great for two but remember that when that creature goes to a graveyard this stays and boy 
so the next creature it will only take one to equip it to that creature 
again this is very important and makes it a very powerful car 
normally what i would do if i was doing a spell for healing is i would write out a petition 
that would be almost like a prayer saying what i intend to do and for whom i intend to do it 
then i sometimes use a pop it as i had mentioned before and i would wrap herbs around it 
for if say they had a broken leg i would concentrate the healing on the lake part 
sometimes what i do is take a photograph and put the photograph over the face so that it actually looks like the person 
that's called sympathetic magic 
where i'm not actually doing the magic on somebody but i'm doing it on some thing instead 
then i would place it on the tentacle and i would continue with the spell saying what i would want for the healing and want for the person 
and of course for the highest good of all and that it harm none 
this edge weapon attack we're going to look at the hooking attack one more time 
but this time i want to use a twisting or a locking type techniques 
or use the same type of set up i did here 
come out similarly continue to roll it over the movement disposition here 
some already moving naturally enough as it in that direction again 
here 's my arms come here 
plenty to do is step as a come in here but my elbow overhears and then draw him dan and through 
his hand is above his elbow and cause a great deal distress and easily pop the blade 
here are just going to draw him around 
and as i do that my initial my inertia my spinning drags him along with me 
i had to do very little to make that happen 
pressed down and in the blade comes out eject the attacker away 
this remember i'm getting off the line 
concerts here and do this 
from here i'm off the line making pause and contact with the risk 
already really kind of started this way so continue in arm over and and i go 
pressed down in pop and i found 
eject the attacker 
by now we're going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project 
got here my hand as a paint will 
it gives the different colors that independent stores will offer 
so you can have this great selection to choose from 
depending upon the application you're going to either want to get a flat an eggshell san blas semi glass all that can be done regardless of your coat color choices 
personally i would put a glossary semi gloss on your doors and an eggshell or sat in on your walls 
it can use flat to go along your shillings or you can use a satin finish for that as well 
the reason for this from a different sheen's is to bring out the different colors the different textures and also durability and clean ability 
higher gloss paint is going to give you more of the cleavable surface whereas a flat pain is not easily is clean 
and you can't see it 's not going to have to explain it but it is not a box light so whatever when you haven't at an angle whatever whenever catches on this side is going to write down and go to run out that you're going to have your stockpile down at the end 
it doesn't gathered up on both sides and bring it through 
it'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or relocation dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side 
this this unlike the box blade he is not box hand and so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and will eventually go over to the side 
when you want that for snow removal or or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road after the side of the road and that's what this kind of blade with before 
very with michael britain films that org look at in salt lake city utah we're talking about using microsoft windows 
and now want to talk to you about how to save a file with a different name 
this is very helpful 
for example if you create a file in a word or excel and then you decide you want to change the name or like let's say for example you're creating a spreadsheet for your budget for the month of january and then come the next month you want to use the same spreadsheet but it's for the month of february and you want to separate 
warner re save over the january once you're going to want to relay will that february and say to you that the same location or another location and so i'm going to show you how to do that 
let me start by saying that windows xp as a registered trademark of microsoft and i am in no way affiliated with microsoft 
to save a file with a different name is very important because you might want to reuse some of the same files and eventually changed the name so that you don't really save over the yield file so that you still have the old file 
i've gone ahead and opened a word document here called document one 
that is the default name for any word document when i opened it up 
we 're gonna go ahead and just type in a bunch of jargon here 
well let's save this document 
we say let's just go ahead and save as and we're going to choose it to go to our desktop 
it automatically chooses the first couple of letters of our of our text so what we're going to do this we're going to go ahead and change this to test document and there were in a scroll of here to save and it's going to save it to the desktop 
and as you can see up in the upper left hand corner or document now is called test document microsoft word 
glenn close out of this document 
as you can see over here in our desktop we've created a file called test document 
what i'm going to do is i'm going to double click on this and reopened as because while we want to do is let's say a couple of months have gone by in our test document whatever he typed and that was really important but we need to make some changes but even though we make the changes we still want to keep the original file 
what we're going to do so we're going to open our original file and then let's say we want to make some changes by may be dropping some of this text down maybe want to add some text here maybe want to add some numbers or something 
what we're gonna do as with when we go to file we don't want to click save because what that's going to do is over right our existing test document that erasing what we've had originally 
so if we want to keep the original and save this is a new separate file we're going to want to go to save as again 
this time when it comes up it's going to bring it up as the old named has taken me 
we do not want to click save just yet 
let 's say we want to add in test document to so that we have a part to actually better yet let's write poetry test document part two 
and now we can either hit enter or left click with their mouse on save 
we've chosen the same into the desktop 
now says if you look in the upper left hand corner as test document part two 
closes document and we see that on our desktop we have now created we now to documents created 
we have test document and test document part two 
that 's how you successfully save the file with a different name thus organizing your desktop or your computer a lot better 
to suited ace three suited this is pretty much the best omaha high low hand because it gives you gives you the aces when the high if you catch another acer too 
it gives you suited ace to suit at age three 
with these you can pick up a high of a straight you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush 
so you have a number of ways to when the high also you have a number of ways to win the low 
what does that mean visually 
well let's look at this board here that i've laid out 
we've got a board of jack ten eight three and five and our opponent has played a rather dubious hand for omaha high low 
but played it nonetheless and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to the queen 
alas he does not when the low with his five to he doesn't qualify for low because he matches the five 
we on the other hand have a low hand we have eight five three deuce ace so we would win half the pot 
bouquet sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and occasion cooking are sausage making that they stuff about just about anything 
to casings in the sausage you can do rabbit can do ghosts can do chicken turkey catfish i mean basically anything 
the trick is to figure out the right seasonings the goals will what those meat that you use or they're fascinating 
today we're going to do as a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and we're going to use some pork to actually bind together 
another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg white to create and by 
for this recipe we're going to do some a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our feelings so let's get started 
another important thing for you to remember and this is going to be a little difficult because we all tend to like to please people we all tend to like accolades and praise 
but it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech 
everyone does not have to love you 
found that out many many years ago as a college professor when i used to try to please all of my students 
invariably i would have one or maybe two a semester that just they soon like me 
it didn't matter what i did they didn't like me 
that was oh 
ok if one or two people disagree with your speech 
ok if one or two or three people don't like you 
you have to continue to allow that to be ok you also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker 
while the last time i did that speech everybody hated it 
or everybody said i was bad 
past failures of people not liking your speech or not liking you have nothing to do with present and future presentations 
maybe that happened before 
ok so what 
and move on 
it won't happen this time just because it happened last time 
what we'll do at this point is mount the blanks on a mandarin 
when she take off the excess pushing center nudge slide your blank on the second bushings 
are important because they'll size you on each end 
and now that we couldn't put the second blank on because it's a little bit too long so we'll use a spacer a washer and not to hold the pieces 
it has a number to taper to fit this and and you'll see at this and there's a conical conical hole 
way this works you'll see it into the man drove into the spindle and bring up your tail stock a cone center in it and bring it up snug 
titan 
if you tighten it you're going to cause this to bow and it's going to cause a cause of vibration 
there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking 
the first one that need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored or right 
and a lot of this has to do with structure which i'm going to talk about in a minute but you're thinking on your feet 
you know the topic but you have to while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation you have to keep your audience interested 
he can't ramble on you can't have random organizational patterns you have to keep the audience with you 
so that's something that you run the risk of this is your audience not staying with you 
obviously you're your goal your aim is to appear affective as a public speaker giving a well thought out speech 
while you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought out speech you just met the topic 
so you have to try and present a well thought out speech but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time 
also one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details you haven't had time to research you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech so you're going to miss out on some of those details 
and those are some of the negatives that there are not in such great things about impromptu speaking just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech 
know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them 
the next environmental factors that you want to look at our the date in the year 
when does this take place 
in one thousand nine twelve 
is it a thousand nine hundred and sixty's 
a two thousand and eight 
in the future 
getting real important to know what time period because people acted differently the social norms were different in different time periods 
we also want to take a look at the seas 
what time of year does this take place 
and it could change throughout the player the movie but is it taking place in the winter 
is it taking place in the summer 
the fall 
a sprain 
these are real important things because let's say it's taking place in new orleans and the summer 
that means it's going to be hot and muggy and that's going to directly affect how your characters going to respond 
or is it taking place in north dakota in the winter where it's very very cold 
that will affect how your character react in response and moves and so forth and so on 
you also need to take a look at the time period in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this player movie take place 
is it a day 
a week 
with that in mind 
is that a year 
everything usually take place in the morning or in the middle of the night or in the daytime 
all of those things can affect how your character actor 
also you will also want to take into consideration the date 
meaning and are there any specific holidays 
does it take place on a sunday 
what do people usually do on sunday 
is that take place on a monday 
what are people usually doing on a monday 
take place over st patricks day or presidents day or christmas 
taken to affect all of those environmental factors 
we look at it from from several aspects and the first thing that i would want to speak to would be the owner of the business the ceo and in my profession i work for a company that provides wellness programs 
we 've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful producing results 
and so the real key to it is you mr ceo you mr owner of the business and why would that be 
well if you're not healthy can you have a healthy organization 
if you're not setting the example if you're not being the leader than who's going to lead 
i've spoken with several different companies can remember one particular a bank president and his senior vice president we sat down together we started to talk about this subject of because he wanted a wellness program and that's why i was there 
so we started talking about it and i said to him well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really healthy group of employees 
and i said well one of them would be exercise 
and you're going to have to have some way of getting your employees involved with regular exercise 
another one is drinking water and we're going to get into these more detail 
another one would be eating a proper diet 
when will we got to that i said you know and it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the the bad foods 
and i said well you know like ice cream ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time it's got so much sugar and it is really going to have an effect on the present so will we can't go there that's my favorite food 
so then i said well maybe sodas who would be something that you would start with 
he said oil and vice president said we can't go there because he is addicted to soda 
so the net net is after our presentation i called back and i wasn't getting any called 
we want to wellness program but we really don't want to lead 
but when you think about that is is that going to get the job done for 
so i speak to you mr ceo mr corporate owner mr corporate president that are trying to to produce something positive in your company you need to pay attention to your own health 
think about it if you have a heart attack if you're hit with cancer what is going to duty organization

part of the drink that we are about to make is a black and tan 
well there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan 
but if you ask most people will tell you that it's guinness and bass ale 
first thing to do is going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your bass halfway 
are going to fill the rest of the way with guinness 
the guinness is darker 
we will see the difference between the top and the bottom 
should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see 
atop should be a little bit darker than the bottom 
and that's a black and tan 
so anytime you want to spice up your guinness a little bit and you don't feel like haven't just a bass make yourself a black and tan mixture of both 
bottoms up 
another important aspect of the pre flight is check our control surfaces 
we want to check just like with the other structural stuff we want to check and make sure that all the rivets and all the are in good shape and cracks or any damage there 
when you check for freedom of movement so we want to be able to move this 
binding sounds nothing of that nature 
best want to check in the cockpit while we're doing this and make sure that they control yolk is moving the proper way 
while we're here we also want to check the trim tab this is an integral part of our elevator 
and make sure that that is freedom of movement as well 
we also want to check the rudder control surfaces well and make sure that we have some movement here no binding and make sure there's no damage to the skin or the rivets here as well 
we went to check our ailerons 
one on each wing 
we want to check and also for freedom of movement 
in this case we want to make sure that when one goes up the other one goes down 
on the underside of the aileron we also want to check the three hinge points to make sure that all the votes are secure and that the hinge pins are also in place insecure 
outside

this is another version of a counter to an arm or defense 
setting up the armed bar i want to make sure i control one arm and with the same sound but that same put on his hip 
from the amateur nine degrees bring this leg up in a good situation 
bring this one here and clamp this one straight down towards the floor prince the knees together amperage 
soon though as he feels it coming i'm just too slow 
this position he's going to stop me 

standing up on my neck which is not a corner 
i 'm not ready to abandon my technique yet 
hey maintain control of my left him keep it tight keep my knees together people from escaping 
i'm going to let go of my right hand and grabbed his heel 
lift his leg and throw it that way as i throw my feet towards the four here maintaining control again keep money together and then bridge 
ok so or kimchi is pretty much all mixed up now and when you're doing this at home you could really set this aside can let it let the tickling process happen for a good solid half an hour to a tower and you can see now already the difference in the texture of the kimchi 
and cucumbers not stiff anymore and it'll still break and when you eat it has a nice crunch too 
so once it's running all we have to do is revisit our race which has now done in the rice cooker 
spoon some of it out wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi 
and you can do it over the rice you can do run side of the race you can do it however he like canned if you're really ambitious and he went to the asian market and got yourself some kimchi traditional kimchi 
put that into and there you have your basic korean male vegetarian 
the hottest become very popular here of late is the circle hooks circle hook had been use japanese fishermen longliners for years and years but in recent years if develop lighter smaller ensure type hooks which are very well suited particularly the folks at or into the hook and release type fishing 
facebook basically is designed to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth 
this type of work when you get a bite you can't jerked rod to set the hook 
we basically just real down and get the line tight and official take off and when he does usually turns comes right in a corner of his mouth and srx really like a kind of like a bottle opener 
watch once you get it in there it is very difficult to remove this hook so you catch a lot of fish when you hook up the fish are rarely ever lose and because of that particular mechanism 
the nice thing about the circle hook is good hook a lot of fish 
damage a lot of fish 
simply getting up to the bone 
if you want to relay seem you can relay seamer cut the hook out and it's a pretty it's a pretty friendly hook for fishing 
it 's really easy to do you can throw at a call from your home phone to your cell to your office to your neighbor for all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated 
in my case that seventy three 
i hit star seventy three here a message he tells me what to do 
generally i would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to and then automatically it happens on him thinking about it 
hang up walk away it happens 
the easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that review so that you can undo it 
because when they come home you want to get the calls back to your phone another number in my case star seventy three 
listen and it will undo that call forwarding 
phone company will have a different sequence of numbers 
so make sure you check that before you start taking take advantage of that facility 
call forwarding it's a really really grateful for home or for business

we're talking about weight loss tips 
a really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group 
having friends to do with you family members or even join in the support group 
it occurs we do offer nutrition classes that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other 
tips on different salad dressings reviews that are lower fat that taste better 
so just to have a group of women doing it with you or even friends or a spouse someone that's there to support that knows what you're going through 
can help you through it and you can help them 
so if you want to find one you can bring a friend if not if you do go to a facility like curves or other facilities they do offer support groups where you can deal with that group of friends and economic together 
another part of our support group is we with these ladies on the wall they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they may come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people that make him they find it hard to work out they stay in our camp and we keep track of them column let him know that we're going to their they haven't had their three times a week that we 
and as different ways that we support our ladies through exercising three times a week 
did you know that vista can actually use more than one processor 
diana fossil of unfold i t and afonso consulting and this is how to set vista processor affinity 
processor affinity is a fancy way of saying you can allocate which processors run for which applications 
now you want to do this if you have an application that uses a lot of resources and you really don't want running on all your processors taking up all their time or if you want to split up your processes across sea views in a bit more of an organized fashion rather than one vista do it itself 
it 's not a very common thing but if you're burning a dvd if you're making videos if you're doing anything requires a lot of processor time and still any your machine to be usable 's a really good thing too 
so organ to do is i'm just going to bring up the task manager by right clicking on the taskbar clicking on task manager 
over here we're going to see a lot of programs under the processes tab find the one you want 
just grab one of them camp suit sure i'm going to set the affinity 
now it's going to come up with what can i send it to 
said the cps zero cp you want 
the two processor machine starting at zero suddenly felt no he can only run on cp one hit ok 
boom 
you shouldn't need to do this very often 
really it's only going to happen if you're doing a lot of video editing sound processing or anything it requires a lot of processor time and it should be used with caution because it can wind up annoying or just otherwise making programs run kind of funny but used properly it will make your experience a little bit better and make this a little bit more tolerable 
dan afonso and that was how to set processor finnerty on vista 
sex program talking about is on one to do a necklace and i'm going to make a turquoise tackles since i have was a turquoise here to choose from 
and i'm going to use a toggle class which has the circle and i also has an piece here with a chain 
so i'm going to put the second mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace 
this is the type of beer and many years 
scada flat disk 
also this type but i'm going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it's going to be sixteen inches 
most manufacturers when you buy your bees they come in sixteen inch length 
because this is such a simple design here i thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice 
so i was going through my large beads hair and i was looking to see which one would match it nicely 
when looks a little too blue here 
see what would look nice with the the necklace and i think this one with the mind as a centerpiece 
that would look really good 
what will do as will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece 
the beat 
will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design 
that would be the beginning of it

and you can adjust the pressure of the tire then you change tyre pressures every time you come in different non track conditions jagged continues to change everything on time you go out there 
it 's really easy to use as gods the number engage on it 
especially love into this though and it will show you are read 
industry in the ticks and you just have higher pressure with this little but it just looks air out of the time 
it's really easy to use 
tire air pressure in the tires by an air tank it is pressurized which thin thin thin and spreading pressure and the person that our friends 
on how much to drag is changing my time with only one or two p s eyes that you're thinking in or out of the tire 
my name is dave shack and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing 
some of the things to prepare it would be obviously some upper body stretching 
upper body and abdominal exercises 
that always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sorry 
probably use muscles that you you haven't used before but with that soreness will come and a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun 
and having out being out on the mountain and just you won't be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again 
but again the more and more you could prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be 
some of the muscles that you'll use would be obvious you your forearms your biceps your lattes your back 
it will be a number of things that you will can find muscles that you didn't forgot you even had but those are really the upper bodies is doing an awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work 
so but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles 
it 's going to be how much fun you had just won't be able to wait till you get back up and do it again 

and we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about 
it doesn't matter if they love them or hate them or they love to hate them preferably a little of everything 
not nest site with the same character and i'll be a little conflicted back with a range of characters that people are having knees and commercial experience and are able to identify with these people as they read 
and right now i'm talking primarily about stories were short stories are novels but there's actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting advertising and if you're writing a story more for commercial 
you still want to know how to develop good characters 
so but primarily out and take money from a standpoint of traditional story 
so one thing that i find it very helpful and a lot of really great writers have mentioned and neither writers who were rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them and is to develop a really great character 
have a little bit of information that natural much information so 
if they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of bodies that character someone from rural life that they know that that they don't know too well 
do is and retain their writing from that characters perspective or about that character they will think what would that person that i do how they react how would they sound how they look kind of looked at from that perspective 
and it's not someone that you know sipper well and so there's still a lot of imagination and creative interpretation which i think is very important which is why they do that so basically 
we have this really great base where you you know the person enough that you have something he started but you don't know so well it takes away the wonder so try 
your characters are not should really gave me something to start with a really great framework 
s and a little shadows to our selection here 
so as you can see we got our sandy text 
double click here 
going to drop shadows select and of course emerge motors and multiply and or opacity as at seventy five and i like that so far 
switch or angle will switch and around to see this third way it looks pretty good 
will put it there and let's say our distance stickers distance of just a couple more pixels seven looks pretty good take are spread let's take it out quite a bit arrogant now it's kind of gotten pretty pretty funky here 
take her size it will take it down to zero 
well it's not so funky notions barely there 
scientists around the corners of our thing 
inlets shoes and new contour for this school ahead and click here and let's use let's use this one right here 
and arrogant 
get a little rough texture going on here 
seems pretty good 
and click any allays legs 
and let's take our noise and we're just going to leave or noise and zero 
so everything looks pretty good right now so we're going to go ahead and hit ok illness 
and as you can see we got a little bit of a little bit going on here with little outlying color and whatnot so we're going to do is we're not pause here it will pick this up in the next part 
now we're gonna be talking about the direction of the ball 
basically you have to directions and we're talking about 
for four hundred underline the same concept you're going to be hitting the ball 
we 're gonna hit it just a little more behind 
this is john stewart and this is some repair tips for your team 
first thing you're going to run into were repairing a lonely get small holes rips in your tea at the mesh in other parts of the tent 
the easiest way to repair the duct tape 
we can put a piece of duct tape on the inside of the rip and on the outside of the rip and just sandwiched together 
this stuff will hold up during your camping trip but you do want to get a further repair once you get back 
other things you might run into is a broken pole 
polls will tend to crack once they get back into phonic he shapes that she might put them into 
when you do encounter this is the crack as small once again put some duct tape over it and this will keep it from expanding and getting bigger 
if you break a pole and half you can repair this by having an extra feral or a poll protector 
another way to do this is to take to really hard sticks duct tape them on their together 
this will get you through a camping trip but you probably want to replace your poll after that 
the poles bungie breaks on the inside the pole will still go together it's just she had to put it together piece by piece instead of just having it snap together 
the rain flab against leak or your tent begins to leak you need to take and replace the same ceiling on it 
just by to the same sealer runner and across the seams and this a waterproof your seems to where you don't have any leaks or drains into your team 
yeah punctures and your ground flaw probably ought to replace the ground flax this is the main protector from the bomb your teen so you don't want to have any punctures or anything like that and graham flop 
and this is how to some repair tips for setting up your team 
and i'm going to show you how to make a blue bird 
this drink is stirred not shaken so you don't need much ice 
fatigue put it into your glasses 
going to add an hour and a half of jan 
so get your jigger 
foreign an ounce flip it over and add half an hour 
we 're going to add an ounce of triple sec actually half an ounce of triple sec 
scrub that 
for the small side of that 
if you're going to do half an ounce of the blue caraco 
despite its blue for flavor it has an orange taste behind it 
to add a couple of dashes of bitters so have the handy 
with just a couple 
it should be good 
and then you're going to start to have your sister available 
put it in the sit around just like that 

and then you're going to strain it into a glass 
so grab your class heavier strainer available and gently poured in 
like so 
and you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist can twist 
for and just like that but in your straw and then you have pooper 
when you're running a press or some of the differences running a press one thing that you want to learn how to do is break that press 
travis and i'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that when you're on on the basketball court 
a number one when there is a press or suppress what you want to make sure you do is when you have the guy in the person inbound the ball you want to make sure that they have options 
somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble because you don't want them out out of bounds for five seconds when they get into trouble they can find someone to pass it to 
unusually it'll be you'll have to god you'll have your point guard and you're shooting guard back here 
what they'll do for each other is they'll sit screens and when he or she smacks of all you have them split try to get oprah was the ball is inbound and they get the ball then that point guard let's shoot and god will take control of the game and look for their actions 
the two guards are back here you'll have you may have the sinner all the way back or you may have a sinner somewhere closer to the top of the key on the opposite top of the key 
but you also want to have your forwards around half court so that they have so that your guards have options if they get in trouble 
you want to make sure that you pass a half court line within within the timeframe that timeframe but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly move because you break an oppressed as pressure is going to be pressure gets you that's what the press is 
so you want to have your office of players down the court constantly moving and constantly setting screens for each other so they can get open 
once that is the key to breaking the press 
suppressed once a guard has the ball in the middle of the court the press is pretty much broken then then the thing is finding someone to pass it to and getting a downpour 
so try your best to get that person whoever is going to have the ball actors inbound to get into the middle of the court so that they have options on the right and on their left 
once that happens there you have it breaking the press 
with the kill the white team today we're going to tell you how to buy a house 
the pre qualification letter it's very very important for so many reasons 
pre qualification letter is going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers find your credit score and everything 
find out how much that bank can lend you 
because this is important because you're not really buy the house that bank as far in the house 
the bank is blooming you the money to buy that house 
so this is a pre qualification 
for that reason is important is first of all we find out how much you can spend 
sometimes it's a pleasant surprise sometimes they say oh my god 
but most of the time it's at present pleasant surprise 
and what would do that pre qualification letter when time comes to present the offer were always include the pre qualification letter for two reasons 
first of all it shows the cellular you are serious and it shows the real true that you do have that money to purchase that house 
pre qualification is really important 
you 're getting ready for the ball to come over the net into it it 's important that you are moving side to side and bones balls of your feet 
you should never just stay put 
b movie because that's going to give you the energy to get above now 
wish they'd have your knees bent your feet spread out will be side to side 
your back should be so that you are right 
particularly badly in order to get up to go get the ball 
so when it's all working right you're going to have your feet moving at all between your your hands and your racket moving inside decide your shoulders your eyes following the ball 
this exercise is what i call it advanced level lunge because the back leg is going to stay straight 
in our regular laundries would bend the back knee 
in this exercise the backlog is going to say straight while the body moves forward over the forward quadriceps 
do this onto the bosu and incorporate again and upper body exercise along with it 
like to do a lot of back work because typically are anterior tight and are backus stretch so it's nice to have muscle balance and do a lot of backward 
so they advanced level land where stamp on the toe on the back keep the heel off the floor keep the legs straight the knees slightly soft lunged forward and then come straight 
so as a lunge my nice thing over the center of my foot 
if your knee goes past your toe than just scoots your back leg forward or backward back a little bit and i'm going to incorporate a row 
when a lunge row and come up lunch 
forward row for the back of the shoulders the lads or i can change that to incorporate a reverse fly 
i'm going to go into that forward advanced level land where the back like a straight do a reverse fly and come up 
again my challenge comes from this forward foot being on the unstable surface forward 
and one more safety point for you we never want the spine rounded 
when it lifted chest open and reverse fly 

for the first bit on this thing we're going to do is i'm going to show you how to pick out ingredients 
first off together tomato tomato needs to be nice and from all the way around 
we want there to be no bruising or no big dance and you wanted to be bright red 
bucardo for the guacamole you want to recover to be nice and tender 
we don't want to be real hard or anything like that you want to be able to pushes circle button on the very time you press a button in and if it goes inland sinks and just like that and that means it's nice and permanence 
you get your mango you want to make sure your mango is pretty tender if you push it down he can go in but you don't want to be so sop to wear your thumb goes right through 
we wanted to be kind of from but at the same time you want to also be tender 
same thing with your line you want to see a nice tenderness going all the way around it and you want it to be bright green 
if you see any browning or if it's kind of hard and that means it's older line and you don't want to go around that line you want to stay away from 
which are serrano's you also want them to be bright green and look around and make sure that there's no holes or bruising 
onions kind of hard to tell what it looks like because it has a wrap around it just want to go around you just feel and make sure there's no holes or anything like the same thing with charlotte 
wanted to go around and make sure there's no holes and that is how you can pick ingredients for making this meal 
next trick we're going to be doing this column grind transfer 
the trick based off grinding 
basically you're moving from one part of your body to another 
transfer and the as its grinding from one person 
let me show you what it looks like 
goes from one arm to the other 
i think this is a really smooth looking trick it shows we have a lot of control over the air 
going from one arm to the x 
other variations you can do for 
some people or atlanta and their palm and shared across 
but anyway you do it your transferring the grind from one hand to the next 
lots of variations 
i'm going to show you my favorite which is the one from the arm to the arm 
so what you want to do 
start with the non throw him out and just practice land and a grinding down there 
it 's going to sit there for a couple of seconds get the feel for it 
eventually what you want to do is as grind up to your hand and this is when you bring your other hand and intercepted 
so try this again 
so the oil lands on your non throw hand it comes up and this is when you bring your other hand 
shoot straight across 
i'm going to show you in real time with this looks like again 
again you need a really strong throw it's really important they are really strong throw when you're doing this 
needs to keep up momentum from one hand to the next 
we should already have good grinding skills from the first grain video with and we just went over the basic grind 
practice that practice controlling up your arm get that really strong and good 
it 's really important that you can do that well if you want to be able to transfer from one on to the next 
practice that and you'll be able to transfer your crimes 
an extra time on the edge of a snowboard 
is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of boy 
separately with a freestyle board it would have a complete wrapped around a free ride board would have a complete wrap around an almond oil would have a complete wrap around but as he got to a german rail board that's where it might differ 
gibran real board towards the center of the board they would either be an indentation on the rail or no real at all on the entire void 
the only other exception to the rule is the magnet traction sidewall which is a seven to its serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the void and what that is to do is literally supposed to cut into ice 
fewer to have a side wall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with the serrated edge and cut right into it and do better tunes 
now i want to make a kind of the santa fe style power 
as the ones that are going to come out in the bottom and they come in like that usually their hand built coil built and then after they set up you take a stone to and you burn a shit up real nice and they make to make it real shiny 
so we're going to start by not coil building it as i got this we'll hear a lot of style centering your claim 
and all the apprentice grind from the wheel had bigger if you want 
they want to come down like your hands lock your legs like your arms and legs paring down on it while we alleging and you're setting a piece of clay 
chocolate have like that 
and when you turn parts it's kind of a little bit more important to make sure that it's license center for little stafford's it's all right so our center but if you are a part that's going to really be a pain in class and it correctly 
there is centered 
right now we're going to talk about laying out the job 
what are you going to want to do is go and measure where the fence is going to to be and make yourself a hand drawn diagram 
we've measured out a yard and determine that we're going to have a certain footage on this side along the back the other side and drawn it out how we want to wear out with the fence and the gates 
from this hand drawn diagram you can then come up with a custom lay out did depending on what spacing you want to set your posts 
we 've got a custom lay out here that goes right along with that hand drawn diagram 
where we've taken a seventy seven inch center dissenter spacing which is a seventy two inch opening between posts and figured out what each side how many sections would be on each side determining which posts will be required and how many of each kind of post 
with this diagram you can then prepare to lay out the job on the ground 
depending on your style of play if you like to play offense defense should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field 
if you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see that the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates to move forward 
of defense isn't your thing he liked to play more of an offense when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense 
ask him where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to be able to not get shot from an area where you're not looking 
for playing offense and europe front make sure you laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team for not shooting at you 
if there's clay on here what happens is as you as you come down here and you start take nick clay pot see if i don't keep clean and that tool after all it does is keep going round and round around 
sometimes it sticks to your pot sometimes it doesn't 
so when you get clay on your and your tool any tool for that matter matter clean it off set it aside 
so when you start with a nice clean tools so that as you take your tour touch your piece remember this is still a sticky clay does your clay trimmings doesn't transfer from utah back on your part 
trying to get it off your partner 
come down in here again clean some more of that 
seniors get it all down there 
he added cleanness off 
sometimes you just get little pieces of clay 
completed off it's got a lot of time 
jim nice smooth bottom down there

yogurt is a bulgarian yogurt nonfat so it's very healthy to lomong the sour side as far as yogurt go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour 
i would recommend using middle eastern yogurt if you can on the homeless because it just tastes so much better than regular yogurt you get an a to b you can 
we can usually find vanity to be and if you can then go to your local middle easterners store and they will have yogurt and i just want to add about two tablespoons to yoke to your hummus 
just give it a great flavor but it also makes thomas a little liquidity and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this 
a lot of people use olive oil in their hummus to make it a lot thinner than when it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out chunky 
it's a lot better to get it more pure aid that way it has a better texture into it 
this yogurt again like i said as nonfat it also comes in a version that is not nonfat so you can pick whatever one you like but it's definitely very good yogurt 
and this one right here is my favorite and i think it's white mountain foods 
you can go in order this 
definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt sauce 
yoga in the middle east is kind of like catch up here in the united states and that is it for the yogurt part of the honey 
and now we're going to go over fireball 
bible is a vein longstanding staple of the red series of this game 
it 's erickson or read much like blaze 
however firewall is a little different 
fireball sorcery but you may pay the x damage and have a deal to a single creature or player 
five or as the extra added saying that you may deal damage to multiple targets 
so he would divide that damage evenly among the targets but you also had to pay one additional colorless manner for each additional target 
so if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red and then you would start counting manner for the x 
likewise with two three and so forth 
but you also get to realize that eric's will be divided evenly rounded down amongst the number of targets 
my name is abbey jones and we are talking about moving into a new space and how to make that process easy and efficient 
so right now specifically we're talking about how to arrange furniture in your living space 
so other than your couch and coffee table and shelves which are pieces that a lot of people have either miscellaneous pieces of furniture that that will vary from household the household 
some of the miscellaneous pieces of furniture that i have our this and this stool that goes along with my couch and have a footstool kind of thing 
and these big pillows that i like to use to sit on that i put out when guests come over and that kind of thing 
other pieces of furniture that people might have are additional chairs side tables tv 
table these kinds of things 
so things to think about when you're placing this furniture is just act and things that i like to think about are and how to create an intimate and harmonious spaces 
so for instance what i'm going to do with this with my with this footstool is since i don't have that much room in my living space and the central living space 
i'm actually going to put it behind my couch so this over here and that will help i guess fall under the category of creating a ruinous space because it's not going to be just sitting on the middle of somewhere 
the pillows because i have a small space i'm actually going to put them over to one side of my shelves as storage but i can pull them out when guests come over when i want to to put them on the floor next to my coffee table so people can sit on them 
something i like to think about what i'm placing chairs although i won't have any in this particular living space is creating a kind of conversation group areas so think about your house 
if you had three people come over to your house or for people and how could they all sit so that nobody felt like they were on the other side of the universe or or your living room as it may be 
and how you can create small intimate spaces within your larger space 
then from to the us and standing on your left leg bend the right knee 
pick the strap back to the balls of the toes and stretch your right leg straight out in front of you 
keep the effort even in both flags and stretch your left arm out to the last does the left arm goes to the laughed open the right hip toward the right 
good effort in the legs but then surrender and softness a little wavering is totally fine 
inhale comeback dissenter exhale and release 
let me show you with a wall just in case 
that 's harder to balance he can come and take one hand to the wall 
standing on the right leg then the left knee take the strap to the foot and then stretch the left leg out and friends they just have the wall right there for steadiness 
we're now going to start lunging the horse 
will notice that i still have the chain over by horses nose 
give me a little bit more control 
i also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides to want to behave and stay on the circle 
it also lets you grip the lines like a little bit better 
cows and have lunch with and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also close arena 
if something does go wrong he can get out 
so i'm just going to start by just letting him come until small circle around me 
this video is about learning how to play the didgeridoo and i'd like to share a few secrets with 
as with any instrument playing a didgeridoo requires practice 
yes practice makes perfect 
the more you play the better you're going to get and the more fun you're going to have 
be creative with 
have a good time 
it's relaxing to play this thing 
when i come home after a hard day at the tv station i sit down in a closed room with my didgeridoo for about a half an hour 
i can sometimes when my noses and plugged up circular brief for up to half an hour 
some people can do it for a couple of hours at a time 
start out with ten seconds thirty seconds or minutes two minutes five minutes turn it into a game that your friends to buy one turn it into a competition and eventually play with multiple people 
in this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of qi gong breathing 
the essence of archie going exercisers is in the exercise of the breath and although there is wonderful energetic reasons why we do that particular chico exercises we do i like to talk more about the western physiological reasons of why the belly breeding that we often times do is so beneficial 
one of the main reasons it is the lymphatic system of our body 
the lymphatic system has two pubs 
when we get through exercise muscle contraction and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm the muscle that were supposed to use and respiration 
but don't shaped muscle that's here right underneath our lungs and the way we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out at comes up 
that action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of them fat lymphatic fluids of our body limping i hate to say it the book of our body or that the waste products of many of our body systems 
so one of the best ways we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing 
it has other benefits were in that it actually works towards helping regulate the ph of our blood which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis and so although the calcium and our bones as the primary way the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat them 
so we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly 
will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing and we'll talk about in the next segment 
so remember barely breathe it's the way we're supposed to breed 
you could they existed before richard florida extreme 
you still have to scan the floating around 
it 's going to add more flour and it takes six steps so you need together 
its great if you have one of these really be measuring cats 

get the glasses 
i have been here for 
some more 
commerce is curves 
now this is just down the whole thing in their uganda gradually the flowering there 
throw in your flower prints

baby couple gaps in return 
today we're going to talk about how to diagnose and ailment of your fish 
started keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them every day 
when we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn they're not in rough shape they're not sitting at the bottom 
once you're keeping your fish for a while you're gonna know if they're acting different 
a common problem with fish his iq which has tiny white spots over the entire fish itself 
a lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves 
one thing that i like to start with irregular ailment going on is using a natural product 
we have a mellow fix an appeal fix mela fix is an anti bacterial and effects as an antifungal what i like to do is use both of them together because it's not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well 
simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much she used when you should use a lot to do a water change 
another thing that you put can put in your tank is aquarium salt 
aquarium salt raises the wreck electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress 
my name is michael it today we're talking about how to diagnose and ailment 
another technique is you can break the hair on first and then start rationing because some people have really short here and wouldn't create the look with adding the hearing 
so no matter what the length of your hair long as is long enough to add or at the here on we can start vibrating at on then re rap and you can make these as thick as you like whatever size like whatever color you like 
like the lack extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all because you can add color without actually coloring your hair he just wrap on a different color 
but really like that 
you can get instant length which i love 
you have a skinny and we have a lot of fatter ones 
we can make them even fatter 
whatever length we can just keep adding here forever and ever and it will just go on and on 
we can make them as long as we want 
hi my name is floyd i'm talking to you today from the acoustic musician dot com and sand utah and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music 
the most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature 
that is this line here and what it is is it each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar 
would be your high he this would be your loewi and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play 
and now the line appears standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read 
but this just shows finger position and and and note placement on the strings to be able to play the play the guitar 
we've just completed our two flowers 
so they've been clear in boston than they've been in boston classic ways and now when i'm going to do is i'm going to make a center for each of these flowers 
and i'm using the jumbo islets and my crocodile and i'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the three sixteenths punch 
punch it out and do the same thing with the smaller flower 
punch that out 
and i'm going to be using the pewter islets 
but i'm just going to push down 
sometimes cannot lined up quite right if laid on its front you can push it down a little bit better 
one 
this second one 
and just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room 
right now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that i 

right and then the little one same thing 
right now we want to hang this off the reef so i'm going to need a smaller hall 
i needed three sixteenths so i'm going to adjust poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there 
and i'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this onto my race 
it shows the natural hemp twine because the reef that i've chosen is the grapevine race and you can see ivan bost and glassy glazed a variety of flowers 
attach them with the help twine and that i've tied it all together with the five it was certainly salary grosgrain ribbon to make a beautiful reef that your mom will be proud to hang on her front door 
in the segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets and combinations it's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot 
it makes it a lot easier to to complete the move 
so you really want your your foot brushes to be right in front of you so when you go to set it up and kick it it's going to be right in your wheelhouse 
for now the wind does change directions a little bit so we're going to maybe go here 
so i went to toss it to ryan he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me 
and if you notice it was right in the perfect spot right here off of his set to my foot brush 
now if you want to do several different combinations way of putting a couple of foot brushes together you could toss it up here toss it up here here here 
so you can do with tons of different combos 
can actually go there left foot and right foot 
that will go on to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board 
here we have the den in d c six thirty five cd player 
has many features 
some of which are fantastically useful 
play some music here 

so what has your basic cd cd player features 
stop obviously 
play 
pause no surprise there 
important things you need to know about the player is when you want to change tracks use this button that's called push and you turn it sideways 
push it turn it sideways 
and you can see the track numbers is advancing 
one two three 
ok 
so there we go 
it 's a change tracks 
and when you're ready to play hit play obviously 
and now a great feature of the cd player is if you decide this is the track you want instead of hitting pause which just pauses it or hitting stop which actually would bring you back to track one you can hits go find to find the track you want again track three in this case 
it play 
that's what i want 
then you hit the queue button and what that does is is it brings you back to the beginning of track three 
so find your find your track with the turning this button that says push on it paradoxically 
then use cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play 
so we are in the roll your own portion of shotgun 
we reach rolled one card without a betting round 
what happens now 
well we're going to roll another card right 
player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts 
we see where he's trying to sell their 
is trying to sell a straight or flash or straight flush or a royal flush 
you roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit 
we 're trying to sell a straight flush a straight flush or a royal 
to your left we see again a sales pitch and i rollouts a potential straight 
so we're all selling here and considering that these hands are on similar footing i don't think any of us are going away but you should bed and we'll talk more about that in the next segment 
in this clip we'd like to show you how to load your shotgun your pump action shotgun first 
for most important part to loading your pump shotgun is always make sure that your safety is applied 
in order to do that you always want to make sure that the red dot is showing or your safety is and safe position now 
there are two different ways a load of pump pump action shotgun 
first way would be to take the shotgun open the action put around in the chamber and close to slide down and 
once you have the ground in the chamber at that point you could load the additional rounds in the magazine too 
second way and i'm going to show you this a little more clearly if you take a closer look here is to take the rounds push down the loading gate right here and then take your shotgun shells and push him in 
and here the spraying that inflationary against as my finger goes in once 
says loaded you cannot fit another shotgun shell in their lunch 
for magazine tube is completely loaded you again take the slide release pulled back and then load shotgun 
you load a pump action shotgun 
we are back and we're going to talk about the music alphabet 
so i'm sure you all know the english alphabet is twenty six letters and forgotten 
the music alphabet is much easier there is only seven letters a b c d e 
when i got there with members 
but anyway after gee we start over on a and this is important so that we can read music we can understand music and we can write music it's important to understand 
let me show you the first string 
i told you earlier was the eastern after eight we're going to play the f and the gene was the first and ultimately going to go ahead and move on and the second and third strain but it will take some time if this is your first time to get used to the snow 
such as strong as mainstream followed by a say in the ceiling 
string as a g followed by a j 
if i start on this a climb up you can see the alphabet a cd after a the 
we might have noticed i sometimes move only one for open to the first sometimes i moved to france from seem to do 
i want you to think of two for its as a holster that's good terminology 
remember holster to friends and half step is one for open to one 
for miners 
so we have the first three strings g c 
so do that about a thousand times and then we'll come back and we will large technique for the left hand will start plants and stuff and have some fun 
tim gibson m talking about troubleshooting your refrigerator 
if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator first two things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not trapped in your main breaker box 
so you want to locate where that is and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is a reset 
if it is pop you want to make sure you reset it to the on position 
the next thing would be to check the power cord manhattan the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet 
so that's basically on the power 
now if you still do not have power you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point because it could be something internal to the refrigerator 
this particular refrigerator it has all electronic controls so it has its own centers which really tell you what's going on 
this particular model up here if you have some food that may not be staying cool and humid check your temperature control 
and this particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to 
recommended settings are anywhere from about thirty four degrees to thirty eight degrees depending i really how hot how cold you like to keep some of your product particularly dairy products 
then the other side here on the fraser side some of the common thing you can run into is whether your ice maker is not distributing irish properly or your waters now coming out 
water not coming out most of these are equipped with a filter so in this case this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filtering and it tells you when to replace it 
on the ice occasionally managers come in here where these are frost free freezers this can actually warm up where some of your ice melts together and the air agitating arm can actually get stuck 
so you want to come in here and break up your ice occasional 
so i'm tim gibson and that are some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator 
we 're talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shaped trace 
we want to reduce reduce the with at the sides so you want to go with a bob you know something short 
probably a little bit shorter than this but something like this would be really good 
diamond shaped faces needed a narrow sides and fullness at the chin so if it came down to your chain that would be really good at what sanctuary your look 
avoid wearing high thun top where volume on the sides 
can ease some french or being to cover a narrow forehead so there's something like this would be really great right about here like this it really helps change the shape of your face and give you just have better luck throughout 
applause 
right now we're going to talk about chopping of our onion for our garlic committed reset 
neat about a quarter cup of onion 
which were due credit and really thin slices 
we're gonna miss this 
other side 
so that the sun 
and as you can see the pieces are pretty thin 
help for the missing part 
we get them all going the same way that our work 
go against the wake up before 
skipton together 
and if you want to pivot your edge of your knife on one side and fan out hope as well 
and then find a new pivot point because their wages not cutting the exact same thing 
when you want your pieces enough about that big 
we have the bottom prepared and we've got our little ball that has the pedestal and this is set up as well 
but also as leather hard 
and as you can see when i set it on their if the little too big 
it doesn't quite slip into that pedestals 
so i have to trim this as well 
what i need to do in order to trim this first you want to get the wheel headway 
this is important because i just use section for hold my pieces to the wheel 
and that's going to happen because when i put this wet lip against the sweat peace and i'm going to drop it kind of hard 
now it sucked on there 
from hitting it it's not moving 
so again i'm going to spend it and i'm going to tap it on center 
and pressed down in the middle you notice it slid at first that was the section releasing 
pressed down in the middle and that recreates that section 
so it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center 
and next will criminal 
one thing as you notice we don't have any three point lunch here but that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during sometime during that period three point line 
with three point line is actually i talked about it earlier in one thousand nine point nine for college and high school and actually an mba at the nba lies a little further out twenty three now twenty three feet noni juice 
so whenever you shouldn't same shooting mechanics 
we want to take you take your three point 
i'm going to show you i'm going to take actually go across court here to show you exactly where around about whether three point shot would be being is how we don't have actually have a three point line or when al gore 
so check me out 
coming over here in the shooting the three point shot same shooting mechanics applies irregular shot no changes you just might down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot unless you're strong enough to actually get it would etc 
so you'd taken to taking your three point shot you want to make sure if you're playing outside outdoors you gotta laugh for the way and that's the thing about plant outside 
we always got a lot for them 
so if you take a little more distance so you shoot me three points shock to allow for the wind and just like that you take the sat 
so saying shooting mccain is a black and there you have it shooting the three point shot 
view gathering she from heaven and earth 
i want you to if you'd like to follow along with me be great 
but gather chief from heaven and earth one of the things and she going what's great about she dome is that the movements can be very very simple 
we don't have to do any complex movements here 
complex movements later on in higher levels of chewing gum 
but the wonderful thing about she gum is that she gung can be done with any age group 
in the age group 
have movements in she go that eighty year olds can do nine year olds can do 
we have movements and she goes that require a stronger flexibility more deterrence and so on 
the point to this is that when we do chico you can do so many different movements 
so many movements and she gun that when you learn a great amount to chew gum you can pick what she would like to do what your body can can handle 
pay 
real simple one is gathering chief from heaven and earth 
what i'd like to do is demonstrate the forum for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this 
we always want to start out in the who will cheap posture 
first one always stand the will 
work your way from the feet up to the top of the 
once you do that and you go to you 
breathing inhale 
hail 
from here once you have a feeling of peace and focus the mind isn't racing around anymore that you're very calm and relax let speak in the movement 
then begin the posture and the movement of what we're going to juice which is gathering she from heaven 
let 's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that 
again so many variations 
want to show you something simple and basic 
my theory about shoulder width apart pretty much have to do a decent squat 
take my tubing up and i'm going to open up my palm so they're facing forward 
what am i doing with this 
as i go down and up in a squat position i have to resist the tubing right 
trying to keep me from coming up 
as i stretched to be straight up and down it makes the squat harder 
once again you don't want to have been forward too much on this 
key on this one and something to keep in mind on this position is this 
if you're to being is really tight you might not be able to get up and less your legs are close together 
squat position close together doesn't work very well 
so the key on something like this is that you're too been what you've purchased or what you have has enough flexibility that when you stand on it you can really stand wide 
but it's definitely a great exercise and i highly recommend it 
right now i'm here with two personal trainers ryan reagan's berg and josie and we're doing some renegade rose 
so what i want you to do is go ahead get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands or as rinds going to show his later on a little variation for it 
jones is here in a pushup position 
and what you're going to do is going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your ribcage shifting your weight back and forth 
if you're just starting on this you may want to work with really wide field 
and i will give you more balance and support as you perform all right 
but at the same time he wanted a little bit more of a challenge bring your feet closer together as you work 
exhale as you pull up and you feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your beliefs as you go back and forth 
brian go ahead and get down 
and ryan is going to do a one handed renegade rose 
so basically he's his own work one sided time 
the hand on the ground will give them a little more support and will make it a little easier 
and then once he does five he says on a switch over to the other side 
again for this work out we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation now wants you to work on or consider if you could do it is a push up renegade roller jones is doing here 
each time you go down you're going to do a push up and then come back up 
it helps were a couple of different reasons helps again condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row are right 
good 

once you're done with fifteen or twenty reps grab some water meters on the next exercise in the next clip 
all right in this clip will be doing the upper body on our acute more cartoon ized angel and we're just going to give him a simple white robe 
for an extent drawing his neck and then i that may be given a v neck shape to israel there 
the top edges of 
what was going to come down and do his shoulders like that 
down swooped down and give him some flowing robes here 
we're going to draw the sleeves coming into his side like that and as you draw his robe coming down to his boat would be can give it a little bit of outward curves so that when you come in and draws belt like that and a little bit of a realistic little space where the fabric would kind of bend in there like that like that 
little swooping details of the road like that and then chas hands in there 
standard cartoon hands before fingers 
and this guy looks like he's wishing as peace on earth and goodwill toward men 
there 
at the top of his robe his sleeves little belt there his hands and that will work well for his upper body 
and in the next clip will move on to the lower half of his body 
it 's important to maintain even tile courses on each side of a gabled roof wherever possible when using barrel trims 
even length trims kind of the peak create a visual problem 
it is of equal importance to have a uniform title courses starting on each side of a hog valley where possible and practical 
fans are installed five inches apart centered on the valley 
battle space or position sideways ensures that this accurate spacing 
as the valley flashing is a gutter that sits down in the bat and you should frame the valleys first otherwise you will have to cut out eve berlin's to install the valley gutter 
valley transitions onto a roof you should end the valley framing just short of the law retail coursing

today i'm going to be corn rowing my baby sister's hair 
for name is actually 

ashley is twelve years old and she's got a great head of hair 
we we don't look much alike because many of my siblings and my and my home and my family are adopted 
with talk a little bit more about that but 
ashley has been one of my models since she was a baby girl 
and i've been doing her hair and many other people's hair for a long time now 
but today we're going to be corn rowing her hair 
specifically and we're going to be putting in false hair 
it 's called extensions 
and we're going to be corner and that into her hair today 
so thanks for joining us and we look forward to working you step by step through corn rowing ashley's hair 
i am aren't going to be discussing how to add natural highlights at home 
if you do not feel as if you the right to go to a salon just want to add your change your color up a little bit at a little bit more dimension you can go to any drugstore or any beauty destination and get a hair home whitening kit 
ultimately he will mix up whatever the hair leitner is that they give you 
will come as a good bit of a brush ships such as this or it may have a little bit more of a harder bristle than this one actually does 
we will then simply mix up everything that they give you and they follow the directions that they give you 
he would paint it on your hair 
the best way to do that is to dip your brush in and then literally stroke it answers tiny sections that you would like to be a writer 
weigh them gently over the rest of the hair and then let them go you would do this with each section 
we do not want to push them down because what will happen is that or start to whiten those hairs underneath and cause you to have spots 
very gently and weigh them down 
so that maybe they're not even directory touching that hair that's underneath 
it prevents any spot in any errors that could occur 
so you're going to put it down very gently just kind of release it 
we can do that all throughout the head so that way you can whiten as many sections as you want 
one nice things that this is a bit more placed so you can kind of say i'd like a highlight here and then you can actually put that highlight their 
if you do have wider hair color more of ikea very light brown or your dark blonde the home haircut hair lightning systems may work out better for you 
if your hair is very dark you may just want to go to your vote or salon because they are whisked action tends to not be as strong as whatever professional can get and what will happen is that a weave your highlights looking very brassy very very orange in very very bright 
i tend to find that people with a wider based color have a bit of an easier time and better results in doing home hair lighting kids 
and that is how to whiten your hair 
veronica bathroom radical covers the line and days 
you never lean back you're comfortable 
this is where we're going to use warm water 
born the warm side banana 
coal will really be ready sampler at the very end of the champ when closed to give it a cormorant that fills the cubicles 
people don't realize 
it 's going to be a little cold but it feels the critical period 
rarely use our shampoo week to bring the ph balance them 
is that the total continuation of processing 
now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub sections what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products 
but i have to do first is i like to eat the hair after a little bit of mainly young 
can you beat up the hair 
i like to do is go home with my fiber pliable paste 
why do you use that product before you go and finalize unfinished 
i like to think about it as like getting your car payment 
they do before they paint your car 
primates 
basically what this is doing for me as priming your hair and getting ready for that last shot of color 
in this case hairspray 
does it make the shine stay more 

basically what i do by heating up the hair and you'll notice when you put it in a kind of melts in your hair 
it 's like putting butter 
the heat up butter butters going to spread bettor so basically that's what this says 
with sliced bread and butter 
with the dryness 
not going to it's not going to if this isn't helping with the dryness 
moisturizing conditioners what's going to help of the dryness of your hair 
with this is going to do is just how to keep its shape what we're going for 
and it's pliable and its fibrous and it gives you some of that separation you on your as 
heated up into homes and just pull through 

when go into our next section 
actually how to play the game there is another element called speeding it up will take a look at that in the next clip 
high 
we put our garlic interval and we're not going to just kind of some celery as well 
i'm just going to cut off the top end of that celery and when i'm going to do is just good slice lengthwise and another time lengthwise pretty good just put them together and just started tiny little pieces 
i'm gonna need for all the way through 
need about a quarter cup of celery but i like to chuck these viruses 
what i'll do it then start again doing my job emotion my blade coming back away from an up and down 
i got to the shop real find the way i wanted it so i'm just going to answer my ball and then jump up was repeated 
external chop up everything so it's all prep zoloft prep work right now 
come on back 
for saying you want to do is make sure you get your very good quality a piece of equipment 
well we're very fortunate boateng named it after me that color to general 
and it's an incredible ball i'm really impressed with a way to shoot it 's an amazing product 
this is a little device i found it makes it easier to keep in a blind and make it stand to there's got to make sure you have a good good stabilizer on 
this little wrestling and gives you comfort when you're holding a bow 
a different side she says a lot of shots you can turn off the lights dim on it 
is a dual camp system with a fall away risk 
i like a lot of people don't do the rope on the on the bow are the rubber deal on it but i always want to make sure that this is back in line to perfect every time and hunting situation as primary will not do as hunting 
glib we're talking about the holidays and howard defining the line in the technique that we're using 
you can see i'm dip and each time 
can petroleum jelly and work in an area 
some of this area up top 
and you can see how i by titan these lines 
and here's an example what i'm going to do 
and this curved line right here you can see in the segment that line might take the seven mag work at an angle 
bacteria in the final line on the way down 
wind down the iraqi the finest why moving up a small skating motion 
can play the part of it 
and you see that defined it and tightened up the edges 
we're going to do the same thing over here on the thud 
it is used in the theremin mag to clean up the edges of the line which is which is fine in cases like this 
we're just going to continue on 
when you talk about color you can't forget the neutral 
is you know there are times when you need grace there are times when you need colors that just aren't colors and obviously with soon as you say craigie think black and white make great 
indeed here is a classic value scale 
black painted the bottom white paint at the top and thinness i try to get sort of even increments of grays between light and dark 
the average value scale is generally like between nine and twelve steps 
it 's sort of like a scale 
so this is a scale of black to white 
and now in color you know the gray is obviously doesn't seem to have any color and neutral really does mean when you can't really make up your mind with the color is 
we played without a little bit and saturation we're going to play with it just a little bit more and do some adjusting 
so i'm going to go back here in yellow and violet range and see if i can get something that is how gray how close to a grey can i get without really without using black and white 
the answer to that is actually to try to use all the colors in a way without getting too much stuff 
so i've got my purple or violent and i'm going to i know that has red and blue and 
so i've got my yellow and i'm going to add some yellow to it and i'm going to stick with the darker yellow for now so that i don't get to messed up here 
we still have to pay a dell purple 
this is really this qualifies as the dell purple 
we 've pretty much fixed or leaky little problem here 
so what we did was we took this all housing off and we replace nor our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one 
i think we've probably solve their problems 
at this point there's going to be no more leaks in the shower 
again this is something that you can do at home 
it's really not that hard if you know the tricks that's it for me today 
hello have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce wombat deflation i'd like to share a few tips with you 
preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect whether the or the male or female in the relationship 
one of the things you want to consider especially if you're the female is that for instance today most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation 
self the partner wanted to go back to school and be career oriented that it gives them three years time and preparation 
so that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself 
if you've already had a career in your and the working world it's not quite as frightening but chances are your assets are pretty well divided and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself 
want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interests or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive it's not worth it 
you may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afforded on one person is pay 
the other thing that you want to prepare for his housing 
if you have children you need to prepare if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools get them registered 
and you may need to actually enlist family support for childcare 
you may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out in terms of who keeps what belongings that personal belongings in the house who keeps what 
if you are the caretaker of the children you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children 
in either case i wish you good luck 
and remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy 
good luck factor felicia goodbye 
ok so we're throwing a platter here large plate 
and the first thing we're going to want to do is centered the clay before we start to throw 
i like to do first get the clay nice and wet 
and the first thing i'd like to do is push the clay down onto the wheel to make sure it's stuck like so 
is pushing down on the clay to make sure it's nicely stuck onto the back 
centering is a process of squeezing the clay up through your hands and pushing it back down and as you push it back down your your forcing the clay onto the center of the wheel 
i'm going to use this part of my hand to force them to santa 
and i'm going to lock that into a part of my body and my gut here so that i have nice control 
i'm going to use this part of my hand to push the clay back down and push it onto the surface 
first we're going to bring it up 
and i'm just going to use these two parts of my hand to push to play 
and i'm going to push it back down 
it's important to note that i'm not simply drawing the clay from the outside and pulling it up around the edges i'm actually squeezing the clay up into itself 
whereby centering the entire piece of clay 
if you have some clay at the bottom now which is throwing you off you can see how that's not on santa 
simply take a rib to take that offer them 
going to do a few more times to demonstrate squeezing the clay up 
and pushing it back down 
and maybe making it look easy here and it will be frustrating if you're just starting out just sitting down and beginning to throw 
but you really have to do this over and over again 
and after a while you'll get the hang of it 
but don't be intimidated it doesn't work out first time it doesn't work out the first time for anyone 
so we have a pretty nicely scented up 
a difference to the difference between centering clay for a pot and centering clay for something like a platter is we're actually going to make it we're going to central platform and make it much wider and we normally would 
is pushing it down onto the wheel centering on form 
squared up a little bit take some access off the edge 
so now we have a scented piece of clay on the back and the next thing we're going to do is enter the form and pull out the walls of this planet 
will be doing that in the next part of this lesson 
the next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially his inner courtyard or stomach forty four 
this one's really easy to find it's literally between the second and third toe 
so you're just going to rub in between the toes 
run your finger in their massage and between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain relaxing the muscles and dogs like t generally have their feet massaged by their owners they don't like i'm touched by the vets much quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything 
you can do a four foot massage on them if you like 
good acupressure points in between the other toes as well but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain and the back limbs 
want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this nice hurting is compensating by using this leg 
so you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs 
we want to work that point 
again this is a massage just rubbing that muscle between your fingers that tissues between your fingers and really rubbed up fairly hard feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area 
in this clip we're going to talk about what you do once you get on top of the ramp 
as i said in the overview you're going to want to get as much as your way up on the front tires possible 
we also want to get a spin in there so basically you come up the ramp and you want to get a little bit of a hop and in this way or this way whichever way you feel comfortable spending 
it on the front tire squeezing the brake and rotating 
when you've cleared the lip here a little bit that we don't roll back into it when you get right about fear that's when you want to let go of the break 
we're also going to want a little bit of lean into your tire that we are momentum doesn't just tip you off 
you want to enter the ramp a little bit and that will help with your rotating too 
if you're going too fast you're going to fly up over the bars 
if you're going to slow you're just going to slam your back tire down 
petals always want to be in the three and nine i remember medium speed 
today i'm going to be showing you how to a gourmet french fries cooked in duck fat 
so we're currently heating up the oil at this point you're gonna want to be very very careful unless you render the duck fat yourself 
i bought this at the store and there appears to be a great deal of moisture in the actual fat 
so what's happening as you'll see all the bubbles on top right there 
the moisture that's the water actually coming out of the oil and which means it was probably improperly stored at the store or was allowed to partially thorn in the refrigerator 
so i'm going to go until they don't see any bubbles in there 
i do have it a little hotter than usual 
but three for the right now i want to get to three twenty 
five so i was going to turn down a little bit back off some while only from these bubbles to come out 
but like i said be really really careful 
already popped on me twice really really big 
by two foot high oil explosions so just be really careful makes you don't bring your house down which you don't bring yourself 
and we're going to stringer put our string around the perimeter and mark the love we each ant foot round locations 
soon our running the string and string always makes a straight line so it's very handy for very handy for determining the strip the straight lines and then from the straight line you can determine the offset to make your curve 
i'm going to pull the string pretty tight right here too 
we want to make sure that the string doesn't doesn't move as as we lay cloth over the top of it 
so there we have are rough sale perimeter 
so again with a pushpin come down about fifty percent and in this case we're going to be three inches of home 
in a larger cruising genoa you may you may want to use up to about nine inches of leach home 
model each i use will also depend on the kind of cloth or using 
i said moreover racing oriented say 
can run a lot less leach hollow because the cloth is so much stiffer 
in the case of these days sales were using a four point one ounce cruise in slashed to sail in cloth from challenge 
so if you look along as edge here now we have to segmented straight lines 
what kind of approximating a curve 
it 's still just straight lines but we have a much better general idea of where the very edge of the sale is going to be in were not laying out more cloth and we need to 
along the foot again we're going to go about fifty percent 
where we put this pushpin will also determine where we're going to put the foot take up seem 
go for about five inches and foot round like i said 
so pleased to push fan about five inches off the off the straight line foot 
we have a segmented line and we will transform this into a curve with the loft in bad 
another we've covered walk in property let's work on an eu focusing on one point so we're actually moving or we're moving up the body as we go 
one point if you can look at the center of mass is going to be belly button anywhere from two to three inches down dependent so right about where this boat 
now one point is the principle of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place 
one way of thinking of it is that if you have somebody its tensile strength 
and if you have somebody grab onto your arm there ought to be a living breathing connection that yes you there it feels very strong it feels like a fire hose 
fire hoses almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it 
living entity and therefore one point is very much the same thing it is living entity 
and you are looking for that constant relaxed natural power of tensile strength 
not muscular by any means and it is certainly not structural it but there is well i shouldn't say that because there is an aspect of structural to it 
with correct structure and correct relaxation you build on on tensile strength 
and we will continue on this subject and shortly thereafter 
the principles of aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations 
it can be applied in your family with your spouse with your kids 
can be applied at work if at an irate boss or coworkers 
could be upset drivers 
it could be something with road rage 
we're going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques just to emphasize the principles and we just take a peek 
for example if there's somebody coming at you with road rage is probably best not to to block not to stop them with your car but just to let him go right by with a look something like this 
showing 
so that's one way you can just let them go right by 
if you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this 
that that last technique as phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction 
we can see exactly what they're seeing 
we can get a little different perspective 
we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately 
as he attacks his turn 
if everything is blending and harmonizing 
some can be a little bit more direct 
others can just not connect with that energy 
if it's negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it 
it has many different ways as you can see to to deal with each individual situation and principles will help you deal with that in daily life 

i'd like to tell you about the wire that i use 
the wire for the bracelets right here are twenty four gauge wire 
comes in a school of twenty five yards and i just buy it at walmart 
and this is the twenty four gauge 
q you can use twenty six gauge twenty eight games 
are thinner easy to crochet 
twenty two gauge twenty gauge is really stiff and it's it's really hard to crochet 
some of the candy with crochet 
it comes in the silver and gold so you can choose whatever color you would like the project 
you can also get it at the hardware store in a black color 
this is a doll black color 
this is a two thousand and four gauge its black if you would like that color 
sometimes on the internet you can find different colors 
used a black red pink 
for this project and read or a green would be cute 
we're just going to use the silver today 
thrusters 
right now we're going into a more complicated exercise 
integrating more of the body 
cameroon developed more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion 

so jones and you want to go ahead and show thruster is 
it doesn't take a couple of dumbbells bring them up to his shoulders 
were basically he's going to sit back into a squat 
and we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press but it's not that simple 
not segmented like that 
sit back 
and as he drives up again driving on his heels drive and his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then forced the arms up 
good 
then there was a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbells right above his shoulders 
and not out to decide not back but right above 
good 
good work jones 
again work in from the heals up work with your breath fuel that your job and your hips forward and up each time good work 
ten of those and then ruined sega three to five minute break and then come back to it 
again i want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing thruster that is working from the ground up and it's one smooth movement 
it 's not segment 
not the squat and the shoulder press 
one smooth movement 
strike 
we have some very good news for you about feral cats 
in los angeles police department is now employ feral cats who otherwise would have been euthanized at shelters to fight rats and mice at two police station one the southeastern branch the other the central branch 
and they report excellent success because once the rats and mice smelled the presence of the cats they flee 
cats don't even have to chase them 
it said that a parker center downtown la their main center there are now going to enjoy having a feral cats drive out the rats there 
and you know i think this should be carried out around the country 
wherever there's a problem was it be police departments are elsewhere because of feral cats do an excellent job and they otherwise i'm sorry to say would be youth 
alpha south korea we have another case of cancer it's very interesting 
and i've just cloned glow in the dark kiddies 
yes they have given them genes that make them glow in the dark when they're subjected to ultra violet light 
a very cute and of course people want to buy them their turkish and gore's 
and ideas that this research may actually lead to cures for human disease 
right now it's just a very cute idea 
i say that 
ha ha ha 
and we're going to be learning how to play portal again by our software 
a company with which i have no affiliation 
all right 
here we are in test chamber eight 
some new icons here now 
the old familiar power involved death power of all our conduits and now it looks like we've got some other ones 
the risk of drowning and don't drink the water 
so we look here and test chamber 
we can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic do 
sort of toxic view that you wouldn't want to find yourself in 
so we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber eight at all costs 
but look over here on our left we've got a powerboat spencer and an orange portal and power condiment 
so what we need to do is find a way to get the powerball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit 
but we need to be careful because if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the powerball we will die 
so we need to find a different way of doing things 
the line up for flashing wind to floss 
people will vary in when they'd like to do it 
most of the time what will find is that you'll flossed first then you'll do your tooth brushing then you'll do your tongue deep clacking and then rinsing after that 
so when you're setting up for a year rum hygiene sessions but you want to do is you'll get everything out 
get your floss out as well 
you want to begin by preparing your floss for the actual procedure 
again usually what we have there is that you'll take about anywhere between twelve and eighteen inch piece of loss and if you are able to floss manually that is all you would need 
if you find that you're a person who needs to have a floss aid that should be at your disposal at that time as well as their rings that can be aiding in that circumstance where whereby the rings will save and spare your fingers from turning blue and from being too tight 
so you'll get whatever age you have available to help you with this flaw sing at that time 
at this point what we'll do as well prepared to do the actual lacing manually 
risk control the news from a slash and attack 
we're going to do from the outside 
want to create a protective barrier once again 
created diversionary framework is the only comes in here and follow that motion trap on top of the wrist right here and as it begins the polar bear to get position i want to follow him once again 
but technique we've seen several times for 
what is exceptionally effective 
which is why we're seen and again 
create a concrete my protective line 
off the line of attack 
blades far enough away from me that if it misses it misses 
from here 
from here 
and then i control the hand 
he wants to bring it back naturally 
flow with him 
we don't want to get into a wrestling match 
and i want to fight him down here to keep it here there's no need 
he wants to bring it up 
that 's fine 
go right with him 

we want to control the motion and use his energy against him as much as possible 
this motion is nice and small and ever shrinking circle going gently passes form down into the ground 
i don't want to heave him forty yards away 
on the ground at my feet as quickly as possible 
it down 
and that is a good risk control from the slashing attack 
in this clip will talk about different types of breast implants 
there are two essential types different types of implants 
one implant is filled with a silicone gel and the other implant is filled with saltwater are sailing 
traditionally the silicone gel filled implants have been the preference of most plastic surgeons because of the qualities of the gel in that there is better cohesiveness and softness possibly less rippling and a more natural feel to the implant 
what happened was in one thousand nine hundred and eighty two the silicone gel implants were taken off the market because there was concerned that the silicone gel would potentially leak out of the implant and then cause diseases in the body 
sixteen years later just a few years ago it was decided to allow them to be released back onto the market again with certain restrictions in that people would have to make sure to follow certain guidelines as with being only over a twenty two to have silicone gel filled breast implants and then having an mri which is a special type of x ray done later in the future to make sure that there was no problem with the implant 
this after of course all of the evidence weight of evidence showed that it was very unlikely that there were serious systemic effects from the silicone breast implants 
system of medicine has been around for over five thousand years 
before recorded history between one hundred b c and two hundred a d the yellow emperors classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon the tiny continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across 
observation as a key point 
it was sacra just dissected the human body so the systems of acupuncture accu pressure as well as use of herbs all came about through trial and error there was an observation of the of the constellations of the stars and an idea of reflective of the macro and micro so that points were developed for the purposes of releasing this natural flow of cheap 
in this next segment will talk about the six external causes of illness 
paloma names rebecca her license massage therapist in wilmington north carolina and i'm here to give my review and massage parlors 
first of all massage parlor is a very david term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and work hard to get the respect that that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves 
so having said that when you're looking for a place to get a massage you can call it a massage therapy center or a wellness center something of that nature and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing their 
we want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapists 
and you can check with local local networks newspapers other massage therapists in the area for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on research priorities 
take your shoulders right back 
we start off by opening the sternum southern party a chest mountain positive feelings in the body 
so shoulders go right back 
beyond just hanging down relax so they can touch it dies 
well that your chin go up as a chain goes up towards a seal and the thyroid is exposed

it urban legends are often the on written beliefs that people have and announced to others 
well what are the unwritten rules for women about dating 
dr paul author of boomer girls a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of asked dr paul 
if they're unwritten then how do we know them 
well there passed on and the best thing i can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman as a woman to give you valid information 
but guess what ladies there is equally involved with finding the answers as you are and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them 
it 's a vicious cycle 
if you have questions as i often say if you want to find out about a man why ask a woman ask a man asked dr paul 
if you are at the point where you're asking your girlfriend's for their opinions and their input then you're doing the wrong thing 
so the on written beliefs that you're going to get that data that you need from your girlfriend's is totally absolutely unequivocally wrong 
there are no more successful than you are the probability is you're more successful they may have their own agenda as well 
so i would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girlfriend's to give you a valid input for your choices 
and that's what it's all about 
dr paul 
be your fantasies of today be or realities of tomorrow 
and now i've been applying product both eyes and i'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye 
opens relax and open those eyes 
i look for even and these are beautifully evenly done 
cnn what i would do is get ice packs out and have the before i even start the bottoms just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort i would pack ice pack arise and litter relax and take five minutes while i set up for the step two to the bottom 
trim off a little of the roots section and peel off that outer brown skin ok now to chop an onion you want to leave that little bit of roots section on 
where and when you cut into the onion you only cut in here you start that you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole falls apart if you can start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together see how the onion stays together 
and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cat eye and you can just at that point cut up the rest of the route section 
set them aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that peel it off by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vaporous you get to because you're not chop chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted and it's very quick to cut an onion like this 
just continue that with all your audience now i'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife flatly and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off 
another way to crush the garlic is to take a sturdy glass or a jar and just that a little whack that also will crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off which is kind of rough chop the scarlet and add it to our onions next will prep the leak 
one of the most common faults in we'll thrown pottery is an aircraft 
this is a typical shallow as crack which can form either in the drawing stage when the piece reaches the bone dry stage or it can be noticed in the disk firing stage or in the glaze firing stage 
it occurs from the clay platelets not being online correctly 
essentially at fault caused by improper technique on throwing on the wheel 
it can be easily aleve olivier aided and certain clay bodies are more forgiving of improper technique and others 
certain clay bodies are not as forgiving 
but it comes down to handling the clay correctly on the wheel and performing the proper wedging procedures before gets to the wheel 
and what that will do is a line all the clay platelets in the correct direction and they'll be stable on trying 
is seen as seen from our most recent production here at rudy vallee theater called run for your wife british farce about a cab driver with two wives into apartments 
in this scene a police officer who was checking up on some reports of a missing person 
and the cab drivers friend stanley upstairs neighbor is trying to convince the police officer that he is john smith but here's the cab driver 
strands wife mary is in the scene 
he walks into the scene after scene begins between the police officer at and stanley stanley leads to act the part of mary's husband 
and of course he's not her husband 
as the upstairs neighbor whom she finds extremely annoying 
boys pestering them and borrowing money and so on 
suddenly he's trying to show affection to her and this upsets her tremendously 
the audience gets more and more involved in this scene progresses 
if she's asking the police officer wears her husband and so on and then he's stanley standards as well i'm right here at home 
it gets terribly confused and upset 
one of these mistaken identities and trying to cover something up scenes which gets more and more bizarre as it progresses 
in fact stanley has told the policemen that he was planning to spend the morning in bed with his wife 
so the policemen is quite surprised by how she was acting toward him and it ends up with with her screaming at him mimicking herzl this is a little for play a game playing and that he runs out of the apartment 
a couple of occasions this kind of brought the audience to their feet applauding at the end of the season 
for very very talented actors and an extremely well written seen combined to make for a really good part of the show here

everybody so let me share with you some other ideas that you can use in a complete routine 
i did a lot of them with you 
if any of the tricks that we've talked about any of the principles that we've talked about with a svengali deck you can certainly use in a routine 
put something together that you think is entertaining 
one thing i did want to talk about is 
if you're going to do this this is kind of interesting what you want to do is get a queen of clubs that's normal 
we want to stick it on top of your deck and then you want to have them pick a card like this and then you're gonna pull a normal queen of clubs right off the top of the deck ok because you don't want to use one of your own one of your cut short cards for this 
then you could tear this up and make it vanish using any of the methods we talked about some of the other card videos and you could produce another one from your pocket 
another idea you could use 
you could do this whole routine that we talked about with all the cards looking the same and everything and then have a prediction sealed envelope 
don 't be afraid to combine a bunch of stuff i've showed you and you some of your own ideas as well to create a foreign routine that you can do for your friends and family 
have fun with a svengali deck 
another very good use although a slightly more risky use of awaiting wedge is carrying a backboard across moving car 
while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationary and study in a way this is a last resort so you can use 
we need a lot of people the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where its position in the middle 
head should be at the front so that way if the feet get dropped into the water the water will tend to plain the blackboard up to the surface of the water 
about old times during this way you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the blackboard 
if at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board 
if you have the opportunity to do this that person should be facing downstream over them in a better position to maintain the airway 
if you look out on the market you're gonna find a lot of different types of equipment 
for two big ones i want to talk about though right now or metal versus plastic 
if you remember to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat 
typically if you find metal processors you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better 
we also want to look for good mixing as well 
but also because we are dealing with a flammable substance from ethanol it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tank 
also if your heating within the tank you don't want your tanked melton yet so i i can recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks 
do your research look hard but look look for the plastic looked for the metal see which ones work the best for you 
again calling it referrals but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with with metal tanks 
what i'm going to be performing here is called a front squad now that traditional squat usually see the bar behind the neck 
this is in front of your body 
is going to be laying on your shoulders 
cross over your arms to keep the bar steady and to hold 
now the first word develops year tear drop 
what we call it at the gym 
which is the front part of your claws that's neither kneecap 
we want to go down with the bar come up 
but again it's just like the squat and when a push from the heels 
keep your body steady throughout the whole flow 
about depending on the amount of what you're doing to go we will have you want to do about eight to ten reps 
going through a light you want to do about ten to thirteen 
again the first why they're going to cost a lot on the front part next to the niqab to help develop those better 
and that's how you perform the francois 
below 
my name is john stewart and this is how to select an area for setting up a team 
first thing you want to look for when setting up a tent in a as you want to look for flat ground 
flat ground is going to be key to getting the nice solid platform setting up your team 
we don't want to find low lying areas where there's holes valleys anything like that because water will pull up if it rains and it can leak into your team 
a third thing is you don't want to find real rooted areas 
we don't want to put it in public trails 
quantifying clear areas 
that you won't have to move later when setting 
also you want to look for widow makers 
winter makers are logs dead trees anything like that they could possibly fall in your teen during the night 
these could leave you really really hurt at night if something like this did happen so you want to try to avoid all these things 
and lastly you want to find an area that is near other people 
public shelters and stuff like that just in case of an emergency 
and this is john stuart on how to select an area for setting up a team 
i got my first job back in one thousand nine hundred and eighty four on a tv series called miami vice 
they were down in miami filming locally of course where the series was shot 
call came out to all the actors aspiring actors in the area that casting director was looking for people that had skill and we're comfortable in front of a camera to work on a tv show called miami vice 
so i went in not knowing what to expect really 
this is my first introduction to it and i got sides 
when i was told to memorize the sides or look at them and then come back in and i'm going to put you on camera doing this 
so i did that and they like me 
i got hired as an actor on miami vice 
that was my first job 
i was playing a russian kgb agent 
i think i was a little bit thinner lot better than and i had really high cheekbones and because of the way i look somehow ahead or a russian look to me 
the director who have eddie all most who played captain castillo on the series he saw my face mr strong face great balance 
rushing to 
putting money in the suit so to speak 
so i was an ex kgb guy running around trying to kill crockett and to the machine gun for most of the most of the show 
i think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with the real high quality project 
i did monster we shall east around in two thousand and four 
and it was a little independent movie 
it was actually lower than the screen actors guild standard and we all get a low budget pay for it 
but that's the great great thing about this business you never know where or how the project you taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated generalist some films do 
for her got her an academy awards 
so i was in a scene was surely around in monster 
during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that i think it was either the screen actors guild award show which was telecast on tnt or something i think turner's broadcasting showed that she mention my name 
if she thanked me 
daily worked one night with 
we had a long scene to do 
i remember being very cold and i was very bloody and in my underwear which makes you wonder why i'm gonna go back and read that now 
yet do that go rennet because residuals also help as actors and anything you can do to help me out appreciated 
so go rent a movie and check out the same 
plants have a long and varied history throughout time and today i'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones 
when i say no and will teach you how to make a clove hitch 
hitch technically isn't or not but it falls in the same category of the macrame style 
so we're going to do is going to look down to our table here and we can see i have my own have my oh my right here i'm going attached my line too 
what i'm going to do is i'm going to take my line initially i'm going to roll it up and over and then bring it under like so 
going to go over the standing in that was my working and back up and over 
and it's going to come under and then back through the loop like so 
bagel 
this is basically to half inches put together and it's just a clove hitch 
and that's really tired 
i mean you can hold things were 
we can't put a whole lot of attention because it will slip through 
but it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items 
that will merge 
our show 
once again go over well go under over or standing in 
overlay so back under and through the loop with created and there it is 
bears are clove hitch 
by name as rubber segunda and enjoy tying knots 
in this segment i'm going to just start painting in the background color 
when you do a children's wall mural you probably most likely want to always start with like your sky first 
into your background before you get all your objects and those are should always be last 
what i've got hairs and got a little bit of benjamin moore acrylic paint and i gotta in them in a flat paint so am i 
a chip brush and i'm just going to kind of dry brush it a little bit under the wall and 
do way solid onto the wall and just 
start tapping on and get in the wall color on there 
we need to mix it down a little bit than i can always use a little bit a medium or little bit of water to dilute it 
keep a painted on 
faster on the edge to edge painted in the skyline 
derek hill here eternity 
and to find the edges and then just drove brescia to fill it in a little bit 
from too much pain on the wall and 
we really don't need to use a lot of pain 
we need a lot of pain on your brush 
and just take it easy and then use more pain issue start filling your details 
just tiny did this 
entire merrill is going to kind of fade into the wall 
be a wall to wall mural so i just want to make sure that i use less paint the farther out that i go 
the drink we are about to make is a claridge cocktail 
we were in a sort of this as a martini so if you want to set your martini glass to the side with some water and ice and it will get a nice and cool for when you're ready to serve the drink 
we got our ice and and glass and we're going to do one shot of gin 
and follow that up with a shot dry vermouth 
next we will do a tablespoon of apricots brandy and also a tablespoon of triple sec 
all right 
shake these ingredients separate 
serving it up 
ice if you want to make sure you get a nice and full for that will stay cornwall person is drinking it 
we go 
forget our martini glass and strainer 
one important 
great 
and that is a claridge cocktail 
bottoms up 
this clip we're going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise 
a number one last for these birds his flight 
these guys are finally beginning to be really careful if you have them loose in your household 
a lot of these birds aren't team 
people get them and they just have two or three of them 
as your opening up the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away 
when they panic they fly and they don't come back 
flat your windows 
will fly out your front door 
will be think that everything sealed and you go to clean the papers in your daughter son husband walks in through the front door and that verges flies right out 
can be very very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flight 
it seems to be the number one way to lose 
once they get loose outside predators get to them very quickly 
these guys are not suited to live in the united states they are not native here and they don't survive 
the other divisions and worry about is teflon pan 
if their heat into a high temperature and give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them to basically fell off their perch dead 
there 's nothing you can do about it and it's very quickly 
it's kind of a silent killer 
so if you have them in the kitchen if you're going to cook with teflon with them to another room in the house so that you can protect them 
parcels spring for bugs spring perfumes around the house on all those sorts of things these parts have very very sensitive upper respiratory tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol can irritate on their lungs 
these guys only have a few breaths before though die 
so you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house 
and lastly there so so tiny so basically anything your house a dog a cat anything they can get switched into door if they get mouthed even a little tiny bit by your dog or your cat where your kid they'll just squish 
so there's not a whole lot to them they're not that robust they're mostly feathers 
so have to be fairly careful with these birds 
at least in a in a physical way 
those are most of your household dangers 
again if you're cooking in the birds loose be careful with them landing on a hot pan 
we don't want toilet seats open if they're flying around your house because they could fly in and drowned 
be careful you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage you basically bombproof your house 
and make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked out for 
and if they're alone in their cages just make sure that your other pets if it's a smaller cage cannot their cage over in either let the birds fly out or they can't reach through the viruses 
like a cat might and dig through the bars that small enough and be able to grab ahold of the bird 
and if the birds outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine reckons have been known to break into their cages tear through the bars and rip into these guys 
so you've got to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time 
more or less covers just be careful remember your birds very small and sensitive much more sensitive to chemicals than many other pets are 
follow the j b with asr homebrew supply in austin texas 
talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home 
wine or cider socks 
he got a lot of different things you can make here 
so 
one of the things you want to do at the end of or during the process of making beer especially bear making or even wine is you need a rack or transfer some strange terminology nerve wracking means to transfer from point a to point b 
so especially if they're making la times you're moving hot liquids from one point to another especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point 
what 's going to be really difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it 
so so that being said we carry food grade pumps that the reason their food grade is there's a space between where the motor housing is in the actual pump drive with a magnetic drive between 
a complete difference between the motor and where the actual liquid comes through 
subsequently its food grade 
in other words there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleum lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here 
said 
these guys are called food grade palms 
and made by a company called march and these guys do a great job of moving hot boiling were or beer from point a to point b without having to pick up big kettles full of hot boiling liquid 
so 
food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing 
began here dotted now art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as the daughter 
stylists comes with different sized round it ends on it anywhere ranging from very small two very large 
but there's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do 
for a very small intricate design like an eye you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have whereas if you're wanting to do something large such as facade and you're going to want to use the largest you have 
also sizes if you want it to do things like buttons or just small designed like that 
for your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting 
i prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen 
one of the ways that i continued to create my sound is i use what's called a loop station 
in a loop station is basically live recording that's an exile our input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have that goes into the loop station in what you do is you press basically a pedal and it starts to record 
when you press the pedal again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience and in doing so you can create mean sound with a lot of stuff layered over top of it 
be very creative it's a very creative way to to show people what you're about to help facilitate really what your music is about creating a sound onstage 
people really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to to broaden your musical horizons 
i'm going to show you how to make a raspberry sun splashed wonderfully fruity cocktail 
we 're going to start off with our eyes 
like so 
for that into your glass and then we're going to add to that three fourths of an ounce of coconut room any brand will do so choose your favorite 
one drinking it and i want you to like it 
we 're going to add three fourths of an ounce of raspberry li cor 
he just likes 
it 's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor 
and as is our peach tree snobs 
so three fourths of an answer equal parts 
when we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine 
those legs so 
about an ounce of orange juice 
and they were going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice 
this is going to be so wonderfully tropical 
since the name sons 
flash shaken 
if you have a hurricane glass great 
if not you can also serve this in a highball glasses 
garnish with cherry and there you have it raspberry sun splashed 
for years 
now i've taught you on the leg and pass series but i'm going to go over it again discussing more the structure of learning body throws in preparation for learning things like bat crosses over the shoulders and penguin catches 
now as i talked about in the last clip you need to practice getting the trip down one at a time and it's very important to keep good posture and good head position and not be scrambling all over the place to make your catch 
now always start with one object and for on the leg always remember to bring a leg up to you 
if you start to lean towards your leg your tendency to be either the throw out or you won't be able to see what's coming down so you can catch it 
if you bring your leg up to you it takes more energy from the waist town but you can work your agility and it will also make the throw and catch much worry it's much easier 
when learning to put them all together with any body throw you want to have a structured practice 
in short controlled runs as i've mentioned before a very important but also the pattern which you throw them every third throw jugglers tennis maybe every third throw alternating 
you can mix up the pattern but it's important to get it down 
you may also want to practice your balance with under the leg by just doing it constantly on one side 
this is a whole different trick but it may help with some things 
beatniks consumption is that the dog's tail is wagging that he's had 
while the dog wag their tails when they are about to attack as well so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail 
if his tail is tucked then he's afraid and that you should not be petting him at that time 
and never pet dogs afraid because it will just make them more afraid 
if it is laying like this and this is just normal 
when he wagged his tail and it's about here in the middle that's happy that's a normal state of mind 
and when the tail starts to go out and using wagging like this that's when you can tell them yourselves in a more oppressive state of mind 
another thing about dogs when you walk into a lot of times to see their ears perk up their ears perk up in an assistant paying more attention 
but you can see a lot of time that they will get isn't tedsters in their fixating on something and as soon as their fixating on something that's when you need to correct that because that's being obsessed with that object whether it be a person or another dog or anything like that 
so it's ok for dogs to be curious what if the sphere 
we're going to work on an arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you 
call it painting the walls 
so this one what you're going to start with let's take one hand first it's going to the risks is going to come down and the rest is going to come up 
so basically arrest is going to be leading the movement and let the fingers follow nice and relax where the wrist is going 
don't let the fingers take over but the risk to all the guiding 
make sure that our feet are parallel and our knees herself 
belly buttons pull them pressing it toward our spine and our chests has lifted and our arms so relaxed our shoulders so nice and relaxed 
first serves the one hand going up and down 
we keep this right in front of us you don't want to have in front of your face of the block yourself 
want right in front of your solar plexus 
go up and down let's switch hands and 
settlers fingers relax 
together they are going to go opposite 
it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable 
it 's real easy to actually get your fingers sullied so try not to let them do that 
what the risks to all the leading 
a minimum one by three counter buttons are run vertical and center to or existing rafters 
and moisture membrane of felt try flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lab to allow the membrane to loop over the counter abandoned 
the main framing and details are then continued 
care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations 
cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape 
in a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a backset feature you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles 
in order to hold the panels in plain you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of that usually a one inch wide board will suffice 
and ten as a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot 
have bali is one of those shots 
so here's a drill that helps you get the half volleys 
and you can use a wall which is great 
but in this case your practice partner in this case it will be may be throwing the ball to dare 
so imagine that you've had a nice shot you're coming to the net where we've had a nice servier coming to the net and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet 
it bounces off and you've got to just walk at forward 
so that's what this jaws 
sudan's demonstrated 
to throw it via speeds 
we just gives block at forward as he comes into the net 
so just just a way of taking a ball 
we 're not really doing much worse 
it is blocking it forward 
john mcenroe was a master of this shot 
but you have to have it 
various apropos and doubles that you're able to block the ball back as if they valued at your feet you just gotta be able to block it right back 
so what you want to do is you just see the whole basketballs 
armani in a row you can make 
see many out of fifty you can make it as the number of balls and practice improves your results on the corner also going to improve 
from here to discuss short curly locks 
the tourists you're going to want to use to create a curl up can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your house 
crying irons come in various diameter as they come very small you're half inch they go to three quarter inch the one inch the one and a half inch and then that too 
the water the larger the diameter of the use of the wave is going to be 
when somebody like heathers hair you also must take into consideration the length of her hair 
if i was to use this on this section it would only do one term it will be very very loose and he would do something like this are shorter here just to kind of give a little devil around the face 
scientists agree that kind of get the hair to either go under or flip out the smaller diameter or s on her hair 
another great benefit with a criteria such as this one is it does have a heat adjustment on it 
adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order cater to your hair 
heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot 
she 's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your high speed or your heart temperature 
the course or your hair as the hotter you will most likely need your thumb styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair 
i drive this is so after the coral is the better it will be especially considering they're gonna fall 
so you can see that that hero is very tight varying ring with me 
that 's what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair 
it 's going to help you achieve your style and it's there 's going to help you maintain your movement maintain your curl and also its volume 
so we've been working on directional rolling and as we've discussed we are talking about five degree incremental 
well as five degree incremental increase you can't roll down the long part of your body anymore 
we have to start changing the angle as the angle increases 
so in the closer you get to ninety degrees the more you have to be going across your shoulders 
so as it approaches ninety degrees regardless because it's essentially a forward role until you hit ninety degrees 
we 're just getting used to the idea of falling from an aspect that you're not used to 
so if this is my zero line and that's my ninety degrees at forty five you're still essentially doing a forward role but there's more on the shoulder 
and as i said as it approaches ninety you're moving more across the shoulders 
so how do we do this with killing ourselves 
we started the same way we started the break for more of the beginnings of break for in which the leg goes back 
k 
now ladies going to go back but it's only going to go to the other leg 
or you can also stretch it out 
i prefer to stretch it out it gets closer to the ground faster 
so what happens is going to stretch it out lean into it go ahead and touch the floor 
we're going to use a slight kick off with this leg to give yourself some projection into them into the side direction 
a number zero ninety degrees 
why should be able to see the whole time 
so it's across the back across the shoulders but your instead of going across your body you're having to go across your wingspan and your shoulder blades 
from sweet sixteen studio and i'm here to talk to you about soundproofing for a recording studio 
would like to go over a few points about the air conditioning system that i've installed in this studio 
first of all located the air conditioner on the roof as far away from the studio as possible 
in fact it's darn here on the other side of the house 
i say my house because my house attached to the other side 
it 's over on the side of the house 
pipes come in the dumps come in the studio 
reason is self explanatory really you want to keep that sound noise out your studio 
good point is to budget permitting if you can install an air conditioner there is a much larger than the one that you really need 
is a thousand square feet and i have an air conditioner on the roof that can cool four thousand square feet 
a recent being runs much less it's way more efficient at quieter because i hear them installer three speed fan so i can turn fan way down low and air just trickles in can hardly here 
that way you can keep cool and record at the same time 
ok i'm showing you the air conditioning vents inside the studio now 
bears eight of them in this particular studio and i just want to make a point that you don't need to put those air conditioning greats over them 
it 's better to leave those off and in fact they cost like thirty bucks each you can save yourself some bucks there 
but leave him off so that your air just comes drifting in nice in quietly and it's not obstructed by those grace they normally put on ac unit 
what i did there was took some foil tape and went around the edge to make it look pretty 
no i hope you think it looks pretty to me it does 
one of the most important things about drawing are coming up with ideas is having a sketchbook 
and that's a place where you can draw whatever it is that you want 
and you don't have to worry about whether or not it looks good 
sketchbook isn't a place that you keep all your best drawings or even any good drawings 
it 's just where you doodle ideas you just kind of let your pin flow 
we don't have to worry about 
it 's like your personal diary 
so i just want to flip through this is my actual sketchbook 
some studies in here and some of it looks good looks on finish 
i mean a lot of it doesn't make any sense 
it is an actual study of this and sometimes i'm just messing around and doing whatever i feel like and have beautiful aren't like this that's quality 
i can put that my sketchbook and nobody is going to judge me in the art world because it's my sketchbook and i can put one on one 
so first you have to get a sketchbook then you have to just scribble all over it so that there is nothing that's keeping you nothing that's blocking you from letting out whatever idea is that inside you that you want to get on paper 
and you have to be able to be comfortable scribbling in his sketchbook before you're going to be comfortable drawing on an actual drawing there isn't an expensive piece of paper that means something to you that it's going to be a piece of art in the end 
foot placement required for switchboard slide is very similar to the foot placement for the regular for its line just picture everything backwards the only difference is going to be is they imagine you're getting into a switch front side when eighty because the foot position needed is very similar to that 
what you're going to do is hang the tip of your tell over the board or the tip of your heel and just a big toe 
the reason for this is that you need to get a ninety degree switch on and this is going to help you push the board in that direction 
another foot as to be right behind the trucks and the reason for this is so that when you get into the switchboard slide it ends up being about right here that's the only way you're going to be able to get out of the board slide because if you have your foot on the tail so that you could put the wait to get out of the switchboard slide 
so remember similar to a switch front side when eighty and imagine with any switch trick it's like turning it around and doing it the other way so if you already know how to do a board slide just imagine a mirror image of the foot placement that's needed and you can imagine how it will be for the foot placement switchboard slide 
how can i create great sponsorships from my after them and you cry 
when the words because that's exactly what the segments about 
take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors 
begin with you can utilize your very own golf program that you can be printing 
depending on the size of the sponsorship you can offer order page half page or full page ads 
fatal sponsors might get advertisement on the front or the back cover of the actual programs 
another great burke offer a vendor table at the event 
companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event 
well let's not forget your charity or event website 
is a great place to promote your sponsors as well 
we can do this through the honors links to their website or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor 
finally i hopefully going to handle lots and lots of wires 
in a flier is a great way to promote the sponsor 
again depending on the level they might just get their website lifted 
the large sponsor they can have their logo or a full ad 
for more colorful and wright flyer the better

once you figure it out your stance and how to push expires just to enjoy the border around 
jamie front foot forward just cruised around 
once you get pushing regular down and available the spinning around and try to push on the other way 
but the important thing that you never want to do it starts a cruise pushing around longer its associated with your front foot tall we throw your direction often send in all sorts of places you don't want to go 
because remember as i said in the first series aiming your front foot pretty much the determining factor in the direction that you're gonna go in 
so when you push mongo like this name with your back would soon as you him back on the board you might be able to go in the direction you want to go in but more often than not somewhere that you don't want to go 
but screws around get a feel for your board feel for the ground for he started trying tricks and he can just move forward 
and today we're going to learn how to set up a drum kit 
so now that all the drums are set up and we've set up our high had stan going to set up our first crash symbol stand 
same concept loosen the wing nut spread legs to a nice sturdy situation 
more tighten it up 
what do you want to do here this is kind of important you want to take this first leg or one leg and you want to put it facing the inside of your drum set are facing where you're going to be sitting because when you hit it from that angle you don't want to tip over 
seafood hid it from here there's a possibility that it gets it 
we settled there 
it 's a good place right now for it 
and now i have to extend it 
so we can take this loosen it titan 
would receive all in this right now 
we will have to definitely adjust 
you can take to some extent a little bit more 
and then this is the boom and then this is the head 
will loosen go ahead loosened both of those and get the head to where you think it's close enough to an angle of the angle and then the boom and titan 
the tickets were just eyeballing 
i think that 
is pretty close for right now 
i am danny back in from laughing dog farm 
today i'm going to talk to you a little bit about mixing soil 
so to produce large numbers of beautiful food seedlings early in the season we need some good soil 
and there's a lot to the science of soil but you might know that it's also an art as much as a science 
so we're going to be mixing various ingredients into this wheelbarrow to come up with the most rich potting soil that we can to give these valuable heirloom vegetable seedlings extremely fast and robust start 
so what do we need to know about mixing soil 
well essentially soil is made of clay silt and sand three different sized particles 
depending on the combination of the clay silt and sand in your soil you're going to have a soil at either is well drained are not so well drained or downright waterlogged 
good soil is a combination of of particle sizes so you have your say and you have your silt you have your clay and then you have organic matter 
when we make soil we're going to want to bring into the equation organic matter nutrients in the form of manure compost and then something to bulk it up 
something to give a body that the plants can grow and send their routine 
so i'm going to take these hands over and go ahead impress them down 
and i'm going to show you how we're going to mark were really cut off the pants 
solos cover your to my work table slash earning table 
so the first thing i want to do is go ahead and earnest down just like i did the other leg just kind of pull it a tiny bit if we go 
with our right here along the same 
like i said before i like doing that just because i know the fabric is right we're supposed to be you give it that we will press 
sign 
i 'm going to open it up and get that crease that put me 
i want to do the enzyme also 
we 've already done that's what some 's gonna get after it do it 
so now that i have this press still going to go ahead and flipped these pants back out because only to see that makes us fabrics are can determine where i'm going to cut it off 
came here we go 
and when i do this if i have to cover the fabric i like to leave about an inch excess fabric on the inside 
there is a good idea just in case say someone else wants to wear alone or you know they'll have a little bit to work 
if they need to let him because you can still wears the pants out to have some original him left 
so i'm going to start right here we're up with that one little seen that also myself in look on it 
go 
this sign also on the neck side 
some of the room 
so in in a minute i'm going to show you how i'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off 
and i'll show you how to do that next
