back in new york i am the head of development for a nonprofit called robin hood 
when i'm not fighting poverty i'm fighting fires as the assistant captain would volunteer fire company 
in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire seem pretty early to get in on any action 
i remember my first fire 
it was the second volunteer on the scene so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get 
still it was a real foot race against the other volunteers get to the cap and in charge to find out what our assignments would be 
down the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life 
it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames 
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let's call him lex luther got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog jog i was stunned with jealousy 
here are some lawyer money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature just because he beat me by five seconds 
well i was next 
captain waved me over 
bezos i need you to go into the house i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes as well 
so not exactly what i was hoping for but off i went up the stairs down the hall pass the real firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes 
i know what you're thinking but i'm no hero i carried my payload back downstairs where i met my nemesis in the precious dog by the front door 
we took our treasures outside to the homeowner were not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine 
a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed and saving her home 
the act of kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes 

both my vocation and robin hood in my application is volunteer firefighter i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale but i'm also witnessed the acts of grace and courage on an individual basis 
what i've learned they all matter so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success i would offer this reminder don't wait 
one way to make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life 
if you have something to give give it now 
food a soup kitchen clean up a neighborhood park be a mentor 
every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one 
so get in the game save the shoes 
thank you 


applause 
i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival 
it 's a place where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day were fun is serious business 
no this is burning man or san francisco ladies and gentlemen major costume 
it is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo 
bonobos are together with chimpanzees you're living closest relative 
means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago 
now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression 
applause 
but unfortunately we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in a narrative of human evolution 
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin 
with chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guy bonobo society is run by empowered females 
guys are really worked something out and lead to a highly tolerant society were fatal violence has not been observed yet 
but unfortunately bonobos are the least understood of the great apes 
believe in the depth of the congolese jungle and it has been very difficult to study them 
congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war 
and not surprisingly this destruction also endangers bonobo survival 
bushmeat trade and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we're not even sure that to be honest 
yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter swaying the tree 
who are the guardians we know them as they make love not war apes they have frequent promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and soul social issues 
now i'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems there's more to life than the kama sutra 
bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire life 
plane not just child's game 
for us and them play foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerant 
were willing to try and where we learn about the rules of the game 
play in p g and resilience and it's all about the generation of diversity diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors diversity of connections 
when you watch banal clay you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human lactic down and rachel 
play is the glue that binds us together 
now i don't know how you play but i want to show you a couple of unique clip fresh from the wild 
first it's a ballgame bonobo style and i do not mean football so here we have a young female and male engaged in a chess game 
look what she's doing 
in my view their evolutionary origin of the phrase she's got him by the wolf only that i think is rather loving it here right 
perfect play is common in both bonobos a human 
the heat is really interesting because it shows the village really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and and joseph howe play both require extra and fosters trust while at the same time being tremendous fun 
but play for shapeshifter could play for shapeshifter and it can take many forms and some of some of which are more quiet imaginative curious maybe we're wonder is discovered a new 
i want you to see this in folklore young female and she's quietly playing with water 
like her we sometimes play alone and we explore the boundaries of our inner and are our world 
he slept playful curiosity that drugs to explode dreyfus to encourage and then the unexpected connections will form the real hotbed for creativity 
so these are just mulcahy this into the insights that bonobo give us to our past the present 
but they also hold a secret for a future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation the secret is that play in the key to its capacity 
the word play their adoptive wildcard 
in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play 
but really make the most of her playfulness 
play is not frivolous plus pancho for bonobos and humans alike life not just red in tooth and claw 
in times when it seemed least appropriate to play in my view the times when his most urgent 
so my fellow primates little embrace this gift or evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity fellowship and wonder 
it thank you 

to imagine a wearable robot gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users standing and walking again 
for me at berkeley bionics call these robots 
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning and it will give you extra strain and we will further enhance your speed and will help you for instance to manage your balance 
actually that through integration of the man and the machine 
but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there 
it 's just not on blue sky thinking 
to show you know what we're working on by starting out talking about the american soldier up an average does carry about one hundred pounds on their backs and they are being asked to carry more equipment 
obviously this is research thing into a major complications back injuries thirty percent of them chronic back injuries 
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue 
so let me now introduced you have or the human universal load carrier 
over very terrain for many hours 
flexible design allows for deep squats crawl and high agility movement 
it senses what i want to do wear on a go and then augments my strength and endurance 
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device is new exoskeleton this year 
so this for real 
now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users something that i'm particularly passionate about 
sixty eight million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide 
this is about one percent of the total population 
and that's actually a conservative estimate 
we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of the light twenties or thirties forties hit the wall and divinity is the only option 
but there's also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers 
and the only option pretty much stroke or other complications is the wheelchair 
that is actually for the last five hundred years since it's very successful introduction i must say 
so we thought he would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility 
so let me introduce you to elect that is worn by amanda boxtel that nineteen years ago a spinal cord injured and as a result of that he has not been able to walk for nineteen years until now 
applause 
samantha 
powered electric said that has sensors it's completely noninvasive sensors in a crisis that sends signals back to our on board computer that is sitting here after back 
battery pack here as well that power motors that are sitting at their hips as well as a knee joints that move forward in this kind of smooth and a very natural gate 
i was twenty four years old and at the top of my game when a freak somersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me 
in a split second i lost all can station and movement below my pelvis 
not long after a doctor strode into my hospital room and he said amanda you'll never walk again and that was nineteen years ago 
key rubbed every ounce of hope from my being 
adaptive technology has enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again to rock climb and even handed cycle 
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk until now 
applause 
applause 
so you can see we have the technology we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you 
in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations not only for the soldiers or or amanda here and all the wheelchair users but for everyone 


have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous 
i went to prison difficult 
i worked in a coal mine dangerous 
i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous 
and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end 
in fact most of my career i have been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations where the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience 
so when i knew i was coming here through a tedtalk there was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different 
some of you may or may not have heard a couple of weeks ago i took out an ad on ebay 
i sent out some facebook messages some twitter messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my two thousand and eleven tedtalk that's right some lucky individual corporation for profit or nonprofit was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again to buy the naming rights the talk you're watching right now that at the time didn't have a title didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really get much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be 
so what you were getting was this your name here presents my tedtalk that you have no idea what the subject isn't depending on the continent could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said it's a very good media opportunity you know how many people watch these ted talks a lot that's just the working title by the way so even with that caveat i knew that someone would buy the naming rights 
and he would have asked me about a year ago i wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty 
but the new project that i'm working on my new film we examined the world of marketing advertising 
and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could read me for anything as difficult orange dangerous and it's going into the rooms with these guys you see i had this idea for a movie 
what i want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising or the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising 
so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from beginning to end from the above the title sponsor you'll see in the movie which is brand x now this brand me qualcomm stadium the staples center these people will be married to the film interpreter forever 
the film explores and certainly on its way through improper that was more 
period 
for every but not only we're going to have the brand x title sponsor but we're going to make sure we sell out every category and canada film 
so maybe we sell issue and it becomes the greatest show you ever wore the greatest car you ever director from the greatest movie ever sold the the greatest drink you've ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold 
so the idea is beyond just showing that brains are probably like could actually get them to finance the film has identified in the film 
actually we show the whole process of how does it work 
the goal of this whole film is transparency 
we 're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie 
the whole concept the whole film start to finish 
i would love for sanjay to help make it happen 
it's funny because when i first here it is the ultimate respect for an audience 
i don't know how receptive people are going to be to it 
perspective or dear i don't want to use angle because they serve as a negative thing but i know how this is going to play out 
i wanted to do 
one point five million with it 
i think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with him but i think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple of really big brands 
who knows maybe by the time or film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots 
what do you think the responses 
the responses mostly will be no 
whichever so because the film or sell because of me 
both 
not so optimistic so can you help me an email 

that gets us 
we 've got to figure out which brands 
yeah that's ducks challenge when you when you look like when people are going to deal with 
we got some places we can go up to turn the camera 
turn the camera augment let's have an off the record conversation turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your mood 
and just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly disappeared 
and none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i mean i was amazed they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project 
i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as plausible especially in today's world is this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn't the idea to get that new buzzworthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses 
that 's what i thought 
but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this 
that was not the flaw whatsoever 
it would have been a problem at all see this would have been fine 
what this image represents was the problem 
when you do a google image search for transparency this is this is one of the first images that comes up 
so i liked the way you roll sergey brin 
this this was the problem transparency free from pretense or deceit easily detected are seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem 
we hear a lot about transparency these days 
if our politicians say it our president says it even our ceos say it 
suddenly when it comes down to it becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary like that odd still screaming bear it's unpredictable like this odd country road 
and it's also very risky what else is what else is risky 
feeding an entire bowl of cool with very risky 
when i started talking to companies telling them that we wanted to tell the story and they said no we want you to tell a story 
we want you to tell a story really want to tell our story she when i was a kid my father would catch me in some sort of ally myriad giving me the lucky often gave me he would say sun there's three sides to every story there's your story there's my story and there's the real story you see what this film we wanted to tell the real story 
but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that's only because i knew jon bon and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own and have to cut out the middleman and go to the company's myself you know myself with all of my team 
so what you suddenly started realizing what i started to realize that we started having a conversation with these companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem 
friends and make great big giant hollywood films i have friends and a little independent films like i make 
the frenchman who make big giant hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have 
my friends and make small independent film say well how are we supposed to compete with these big giant hollywood movies in the movie is called the greatest movie ever sold a house specifically what we see ban in the film 
if any time i'm getting ready to go anytime i opened up my medicine cabinet and you will see the error 
anytime i do an interview with someone i can say are you or your fresh enough for this interview or are you ready little nervous 
i want to help me calm down so maybe you should maybe you should put some long for the interviewers who will offer one of this fabulous as whether it's a four years and her paradise when they'll have their chests 
while gear for both male or female solid roll on rustic whatever it may be that those with consent for so now i can answer any questions and give me the five cent tour 
we are a small library 
bench like you talked about being a smaller movie you are very much a challenger brand 
we don't have the budget that had a brain and doing things like this remind people about the kind of why we're interested in 
wars and he was very bad man is blank 
applause 
one of the stripes on some he spent in her arms 
with chocolate bold fresh 
as fresh as a great word that really spin this category into the positive verse he fights odor and witness and produce a fresh fresh thinking fresher longer better freshness more freshness three times fresh 
if things like that that are more of that positive benefit 
and that's a multimillion dollar corporation what about me what about a regular guy 
i need to go talk to the man on the street the people who are like me the regular joes 
they need to tell me about my brand 
how would you describe your brain 
the library and an airline really nice 
eighty survival need gator pronk laundry day 
what 's brand jerry 
unique unique 
i guess we'll kind of genre dial and would be like dark glamor 
and i like a lot of black color is one of our great stuff like that 
usually something that had an accessory like sunglasses or crestone things like that too 
damn or a brand he might be a class converts methane 
the branded i am is i would call it casual clock 
part hippie part yogi part brooklyn girl 
the pet 
perpetuate all over the country all over the world 
my brand 
and my work little industry that's my brain 
brand is fedex because i deliver the goods 
failed writer alcoholic cramp 
a lawyer brand 
on top 
well we can all be brand tom but i do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly 
applause 
but i realized i needed an expert i need somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really helped me understand what they call your brand personality and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburgh 
it helps companies like nationally for breeze hallmark discover that brand personality 
they could do it for them surely they could do it for me 
pictures right 
why did the very first picture a picture of my family 
tell me a little bit how it relates to your heart's content 
for people who shaped the way i look at the world 
tell me about this world 
i think your world is the world we live in length people that are running your friends your family the way you live your life the job you do 
and all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me the stem and started with my family in west virginia 
the next 
in fact that the next one this is the best day 
how does this relate 
concerned about having lived like who do i want to be like things that are different things that are weird turning up a wife who wouldn't that different 
the machete pupa stage genuine 
important 
wood 


mother 

applause 
thank you may think 
patient 
things will come to this 
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there 
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct but complimentary size to your brand personality the morgan spurlock brand as a mindful play brand 
a kind of juxtapose very nicely together 
and i think there's almost a paradox width 
and i think some companies will just focus on one one of their strengths or or the other instead of focusing on 
most companies tend to and human nature to avoid things that are not sure avoid fear those elements and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positives forehands and it's anything to say 
what other brands are like that 
for the first time here is a classic apple 
and you can see here to target we many mini coopers and jetblue 
playful brands in mind for brands those sort of things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing 
playful michael brand 
what is your brand 
if somebody actually describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be 
are you end up attribute or you something that gets the blood flowing 
are you more of a down attribute 
something a little more calm reserved conservative 
attributes are things like being playful being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy are daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical mystical like gandalf 
are you more down attributes 
mindful sophisticated w seven 
established traditional nurturing protective empathetic like the oprah 
reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplated or wind like the dalai lama or yoda 
over the course this film we had five hundred plus companies who were up and down companies say no they didn't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they had no control they would have no control over the final product 
we did get seventeen brand partners who are willing to relinquish control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and its playful as myself and he will ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally wouldn't be able to tell stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind 
enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using mri to target the desire synergy of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing 
we went to st paul or where they have banned outdoor advertising 
in the entire city for the past five years there's no billboards is no posters there's no fliers nothing and we went to school districts were now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across america 
what 's incredible for me is the projects that i've gotten the most feedback out of her i've had the most success in or ones where i've interacted with things directly 
and that's what these brands did 
cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don't have my best interests in mind 
i'm going to deal directly with the artist 
i'm going to work with him to create something different something is going to get people thinking that's going to challenge the way we look at the world 
how has that been for them has been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival is just take a look 
according to burrelles the movie premiered in january and since then and this is a name in the whole thing we've had more than nine hundred million media impressions for this film 
little covering just like a two and a half week period 
it 's only online no print no tv 
the film has been distributed 
it's not even online 
not even streaming it's not even been out and do other foreign countries yet 
ultimately this little has already started to gain a lot of momentum 
not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talk to advise their clients not to take part 
what i always believed that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity 
i believe that when you push people away from that you're pushing them more towards failure 
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged 
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward as we need to encourage people to take risks 
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them 
ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace sphere 
we've got to put that bear in a cage embrace fear embrace risk one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk 
and ultimately we have to embrace transparency 
today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way 
and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friend that he and see hooper seven thousand one hundred dollars bought the naming rights on ebay she turning big data into a big opportunity for organizations all over 
world mc presents 
embrace transparency thank you very 
applause 
what exactly happened to that 
seventy one hundred and that is 
i have in my pocket a chick made out to the parent organization of the ted foundation the sapling foundation a check for seven thousand one hundred dollars to be applied towards my attendance for next 
serious 

the really extraordinary honor for me 
i spend most of my time in jails and prisons on death row i spend most of my time and very low income communities and the projects in places where there's a great deal of hopelessness 
being here at ted and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me 
one of the things that's emerged when my short time here is that ted has an identity 
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world 
and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it does 
i mention that because i think identity is really important 
we 've had some fantastic presentations 
i think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful 
if you're a doctor you can do some good things with your carrying doctor you can do some other things 
i want to talk about the power of identity 
i didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do 
i actually learn about this from my grandmother 
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother 
if she was tough she was strong she was powerful 
if she was the end of every argument and our family she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family 
if she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved 
her parents were born into slavery in virginia and the 
if she was born in the eighteen eighties and experience the slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world 
and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving 
when i would see it as a little boy should come up to me and she'd give me these hugs 
when she squeezed me so tight i could barely breathe and then she'd let me go 
in an hour or two later if i saw her she'd come over to me to brian do you still feel me hugging you and if i said no she'd assault me again and i'd say yes she'd leave me alone 
she just had this quality you always wanted to be near her 
the only challenge was that she had ten children 
my mom was the youngest of her ten kids 
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her would be difficult to get her time and attention 
my cousins would be running around everywhere 
i remember when i was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around 
my grandmother was seeing across the room staring at me 
at first i thought we were playing again 
and i would look at her and i smile but she was very serious 
after about fifteen or twenty minutes she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on brain 
we 're not going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday 
and never will forget it she took me out back and she said brian on will tell you something but you don't tell anybody what i tell you i said okay mama she said you make sure you don't do that i said sure that she sat me down and she looked at me and she said i want you to know i've been watching you and she said i think your special she said i think you can do anything you want to do i will never forget 
then she said i just need you to promise me three things right i said okay mama she said the first thing i want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby grown to promise me now you'll always take care for well i adored my mom's i said yes 
do that she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing i thought about it and i said yes ma'am 
do that then found she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol while i was nine years old and i said yes 
do that 
i grew up in the country in the rural south and have a brother your older than me in a secure your younger 
when i was about fourteen or fifteen one day my brother came home and he had a six pack of beer i don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister we went out in the woods 
we were kind of just out there doing stuff with crazily dead 
he had a sip of despair and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me i said no no no no that's okay yoga 
i'm not going to have any beer my brothers to come on we're doing this today you always do what we do 
i had some your sister had 
some beer said no i don't feel right about that 
and although ahead y'all go ahead and my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you 
for beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh i hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mom ahead with you i said well what are you talking about his little monique held all the grandkids at their special i was devastated 

i'm going to admit something to you i'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn't 
this might be broadcast broadly 
but i'm i'm fifty two years old and i'm going to admit to you that i've never had a drop of alcohol i don't i don't say that because i think that's virtuous i say that because there is power in identity 
when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense 
we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do 
when i thought about my grandmother can't of course you would think all her grandkids were special 
my grandfather was imprisoned during prohibition 
by male uncles died of alcohol related diseases 
these were the things she thought we needed to commit to 
well i've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system 
this country is very different today than it was forty years ago 
nine hundred and seventy two there were three hundred thousand people in jail 
prisons today there are two point three 
in the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world 
we have seven million people on probation and parole 
mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world 
in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that has been shaped by these outcomes 
one out of three black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty is in jail in prison on probation or parole 
in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington fifty to sixty percent of our young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole 
system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race there are also distorted by poverty 
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty then if you're poor innocent 
well not culpability shapes outcomes 
yet we seem to be very comfortable 
the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected 
interesting to me were looking at some very interesting developments in our work 
by state of alabama like a number of states actually permanently disenfranchised as you if you have a criminal conviction 
right now in alabama thirty four percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote 
were actually projecting and another ten years and level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act 
there 's this stunning silence 
i represent children a lot of my clients were very young 
the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence thirteen year old children to die in prison 
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country 
and we're actually doing some litigation 
country in the world 
aboriginal people on death row 
what's interesting this question of the death penalty 
in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they committed 
and that's a very sensible question 
but there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity 
another way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill fascinating 
death penalty in america is defined by error 
for every nine people who have been executed with actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row 
kind of astonishing error rate one out of nine people innocent 
it 's fascinating 
in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes for every nine plant it took off one would crash 
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem 
it 's not our problem 
not our burden 
not our struggle 
talk a lot about these issues 
talk about a ration this question whether we deserve to kill 
and it's interesting when i teach my students but african american history i tell them about slavery 
tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war 
we don't really know very much about it 
but for african americans in this country that was an era defined by terror 
many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives 
and these older people come up to me now and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after nine eleven he told me to say no tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism would of course was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid 
yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems 
we don't like to talk about our history 
and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically 
we're constantly running into each other 
we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts 
we have a hard time talking about race and i believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation 
in south africa people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation 
rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that 
was giving this lecture in germany and lectures in germany about the death penalty 
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about said when we don't have the death penalty in germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in attentional deliberate way set about executing people and i thought about that 
what would you like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish 
i couldn't bear it 
would be unconscionable 
yet in this country in the states of the old south we execute people we are eleven times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim his wife and if the victim is black twenty two times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and addictiveness light in a very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched 
yet there is this just connect 
i believe that our identity is at risk 
when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love innovation we love technology we loved creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalisation 
for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two 
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world 
would that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to ten 
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives 
ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are 
innovation creativity development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone 
come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart 
that mind heart connection that i believe compels us to not just be tend to attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things 
hobbled a great czech leader talked about this he said when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be and hopeless places and be a witness 
that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted community's have to be engaged 
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering from poverty to exclusion to unfairness to injustice 
i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this 
it will get to you 
i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer meeting rosa parks 
ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends with older women johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott amazing african american woman and virginia dare a white woman whose husband clifford there are represented dr king 
and these women would get together and just talk 
and every now and then this car would calm and she'd say brian ms parks is coming to town 
we don't get together and talk to you want to come over and listen and i'd say yes ma'am i do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here i said i'm going to listen and i'd go work than i would i would just listen 
it would be so energizing and so empowering 
one time i was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours ms parks turned to me and she said brian tell me what the equal justice initiative is tell me which are trying to do and began giving her my rap 
we're trying to en mass incarceration i gave her my whole rapid when i finished she looked at me and she said she said that's going to make you tired tyre tire and that's when this carly encourage you put your finger my patients and that's why you've got to be brave brave brave 
i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous 
we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering 
because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone's humanity 
learned very simple things doing the work that i do 
just taught me very simple things 
i've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done 
i believe that for every person on the planet 
i think if somebody tells a lie there not just a liar i think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just that 
even if you kill someone you're not just to kill 
and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law 
i also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this glow that the opposite of poverty is not wealth i don't believe that i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice 
finally i believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect in reason 
ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they think the rich and the powerful and the privilege but by how they treat the poor the condemned the incarcerated 
because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are 
sometimes get out of balance i'll end with this story i sometimes push too hard i do get tired as we all do 
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important 
and i've been representing these kids who'd been sentenced to death is very harsh sentences 
when i go to the jail and i see my client was thirteen and fourteen and has been certified to stand tall as an adult 
and start thinking well how did that happen 
how can a judge turn you into something that you're not in the judges certified as an adult but i see this kid and i was up to late one night and i started thinking gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power behind the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of it 
because i was up too late wasn't thinking real street i started working on emotion 
i had a client was fourteen years old and young poor black kids 
start working on this motion within the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor fourteen year old blackmail client like a privileged white seventy five year old corporate executive 
applause 
i put in my motion control misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct 
it was a crazy line and they're about how there's no conduct in this county it's all misconduct 
in the next morning i woke up and i thought and it did i dream that crazy motion or did i actually write it into my horror not only had i have written it but i had senate to court 

months went by and i just had forgotten all about it 
and i finally decided oh gosh i've got to go to the court and do this crazy case and i got in my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed 
i got in my car and went to the courthouse and what this has been be so difficult so so painful 
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse 
and as i was walking up the steps of this court house it was an older black man who was the janitor in the courthouse 
when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you i said i'm a lawyer he said you a lawyer i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me 
he whispered in my ear he said i'm so proud of you and i have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community perspective that is hopeful 
went into the courtroom and soon as i walked inside a judge saw me coming he said mr stevenson did you write this crazy motion i said yes 
why didn't we started arguing people started coming in because it was just outrageous 
britain 's crazy things 
police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers 
before i knew it was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality 
and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth 
and kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this 
and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man but it's very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at counsel table 
ten minutes later the judge said we would take a break 
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court 
this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at ted deputy and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on 
come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice 
we cannot be full involved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity 
but all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone 
our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a vision of humanity compassion and justice 
more than anything for those of you who share that simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on 
thank you very much 
applause 
the heard and saw an obvious to buy this audience this community to help you on your way to do something on this issue 
other than writing a check what what could we do 
well there are opportunities all around 
we live in the state of california for example there is a referendum coming up this spring were actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment 
for example here in california we spend we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars and yet forty six percent of all homicide cases don't result in a rest 
six percent of all rape cases don't result 
so there's an opportunity to change that 
this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety 
i think that opportunity exists all around us 
with huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades 
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rate 
what would you say to someone who believe that 
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable 
great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really and violent crime categories 
it was this misguided war on drugs that would that's where the dramatic increases of calm and our prison pop 
we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment 
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they are victimized 
i believe we need to do more to help people who were victimized by crime not do less 
and i think our current punishment philosophy that nothing for no one 
and i think that's the orientation that we have to change 
applause 
a massive cord 
if you're an inspiring 
so much time 
years ago i started a program to try to get the rock star trek and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represent pretty much everything they're supposed to hate we have them work in government program called code for america and it's a little bit like a peace corps fergie 
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city government 
instead of sending them off into the third world we send them into the wilds of city hall 
there they make great apps they work with city staffers 
really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today 
so meet our al if a fire hydrant and city of boston 
here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date but it was really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow 
how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner 
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program 
we were there in february and it snowed a lot in february last year 
they noticed that the city never get to digging out the fire hydrants 
but one fellow in particular a guy named erik michaels ober noticed something else and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things 
so he did what any good developer would do he wrote an app 
for cute little after you can adopt a fire hydrant 
you agree to dig it out when it snows 
if you do you get to name it he called the first one 
and if you don't someone can steal it from you 
so it's got cute little game dynamics on it 
this is a modest little laugh 
it 's probably the smallest of the twenty one apps that the fellows wrote last year 
but it's doing something that no other government technology does 
spreading virally 
the guy in the i t department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for snow but you get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens 
it 's very important that the tsunami sirens work that people feel the batteries out of them 
so he's getting citizens to check on them 
in seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains 
in chicago just rolled out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows 
we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this 
this is spread just frictionlessly organically naturally 
if you know anything about government analogy you know that this doesn't isn't how it normally goes 
procuring software usually take the couple of years 
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months 
with a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids 
we were told afterwards that if that had gone through normal channels it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars 
nothing 
is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars and it doesn't work 
projects like this at every level of government 
soon after take a couple of days to write and then spread virally that sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government 
suggests how government could work better not more like a private company as many people think it should not even more like a tech company but more like the internet itself 
and that's important but with more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government not the problem of an ossified institution but as a problem of collective action 
that 's great news because it turns out were very good at collective action with digital technology 
is a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively 
not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic at every day in their own communities 
they haven't given up on government 
are frustrated hell with it but they're not complaining about it they're fixing it 
folks know something that we'd lost sight of 
not that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all the other things that were really mad about government is at its core in the words of tim o reilly what we do together that we can't do alone 
a lot of people have given up on government 
if you're one of those people i would ask that you reconsider because things are changing 
politics is not changing government is changing 
and because government ultimately derives its power from us remember we the people how we think about it is going to affect how that change happen 
i didn't know very much about government when i started this program 
unlike a lot of people i thought government with basically about getting people elected to office 
well after two years i've come to the conclusion that especially local government is about possums 
because the call center for the services and information line 
generally where you will get if you call three when one in your city 
if you should ever have the chance to staff universities call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues including having a possum stuck in your house 
scott gets this call 
he tried to pass them into this official that knowledge base he doesn't really come up with anything 
it starts with animal control 
and finally he says look can you just open all the doors to your health and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves that work 
they offer scott 
but that wasn't the end of the parthenon 
boston doesn't just had a call center 
it has an app a web and mobile app called citizens connect 
we didn't write this 
is the work of the very smart people in the office of new urban mechanics in boston 
one day this is an actual report this came in possum in my trashcan can't 
tell if it's dead how do i get this removed but what happens when citizens connect is different 
first got with speaking person to person and citizens connect everything is public so everybody can see this 
and in this case a neighbor side 
the next report we got said i walked over to this location found a trashcan behind the house popham check living gap turn trashcan on a tide walked home goodnight three path 
coverage 
empire though this is great 
the digital meeting with the physical 
and it's also a great example of government getting in on a on the crowd sourcing game 
but it's also a great example of government as a platform 
i don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here 
just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others 
the one that has been helped another citizen but government played a key role here 
it connected those two people 
it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services 
when one neighbor helps another we strengthen our communities 
we call animal control it just costs a lot of money 
one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics 
most people get that but they think that one is the input to the other 
but our input to the system of government is voting 
how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs and then not that much changes 
because government is like a vast ocean and politics to the thick thin layer on top 
and we're thunder that is what we call bureaucracy 
we say that word with such contempt 
but it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for something that's working against at this other thing and then we're disempowering ourselves 
people seem to think politics is sexy 
if we want this institution to work for us we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy 
because that's where the real work of government happen 
we have to engage with the machinery of government 
so that's what the occupy movement has done 
have you seen these guys 
a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed three hundred and twenty five page report that's a response to the atrophies requests for comment on the financial reform bill 
not being politically active that being bureaucratically active 
for those of us who have given up on government it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children 
you have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face 
do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us 
we can't do without government but we do need it to be more effective 
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually fail by strengthening civil society 
and there's a generation out there that's grown up on the internet and they know that it's not that hard to do things together you just have to architect systems the right way 
the average age of our fellow is twenty eight so i am begrudgingly almost a generation older than most of them 
generation has grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted 
we 're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak they all get to speak 
can express their opinion on any channel at any time and they do 
so when they are faced with the problem of government they don't care as much about using their voices through using their hands they're using their hands to write applications that make government work better 
those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better 
it could be shoveling out a hydrant pulling a weed turning over a garbage can with the parthenon 
certainly we could have been shoveling out the fire hydrants all along and many people do 
with these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers and we're not just consumers of government putting in our taxes and getting back services 
were more than that were citizens and we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship 
so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us together are we just going to be a crowd of voices or are we also going to be a crowd of hands 
thank you 
applause 
this may sound strange but i'm a big fan of the concrete block 
concrete block for manufactured in ancient sixty eight it was very simple idea modules or made of cement have a fixed measurement tactic together 
very quickly concrete block became the most used construction unit in the world 
they enabled us to build things that were larger than us building bridges one brick at a time 
essentially concrete blocks have become the building block of our time 
almost one hundred years later in one hundred and forty seven lego came up with it 
and what's called the automatic binding brick 
and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household 
estimated that over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five brick for every person on the planet 
you didn't have to be an engineered to make beautiful how the beautiful bridges beautiful building 
lego made it accessible 
illegal had essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination 
meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be a noun the next building block 
but a transistor with a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything with interactive 
unlike the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits one brick at a time 
but there is the main befriend the transistor was only for expert 
i personally don't accept this that the building block of our time is reserve tracks that so i decided to change that 
eight years ago when i was at the media lab i felt exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers 
a few years ago i started developing littlebits 
so let me show you how they work 
a little bit or electronic module with each one specific function 
pre engineered to be light found motor and centers and the best part about it is they snap together with magnet 
so you can't put them the wrong way 
the bricks are color coded 
green 's output blew his power pincus input and oranges wire 
so all you need to do is not the blue to green and very quickly you can attract major making larger circuits 
when you put a blue to green you can make light 
you can put a knob and between and now you've made a little demo 
which are the dimmer than up for a pulse module which is here and now you've made 
but there for some extra punch and you've created in one thousand machines i'm going to stop them 
beyond beyond simple play little bits are actually pretty powerful 
instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures 
so to make this blink faster or slower you would just turn the knob and basically make it faster or slower 
the idea behind little bit is that if the growing library 
we want to make every single interaction in the world into ready to use brick 
life found solar panels motors everything should be accessible 
we've been given little bits the kid and seeing them play with them 
and it's been an incredible experience 
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at school 
for example how a nightlight worked or why an elevator door stays open or how an ipod response to touch 
we've also been taking little bit to design clothes 
so for example we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever such a plate with little bit of the material 
here you see with falcon paper water bottles we have jody making 

applause 
a few weeks ago we took a little bit to reveal and give them to some designers with no experience and engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told to make something here's an example of project they made a motion activated confetti canon bug but way this was actually my favorite project 
lobster made of plato that's afraid of the dark 

b is not engineers littlebits became another material electronic became just another material 
we want to make this material accessible to everyone 
so let admitted open source 
and you can go on the website download other designed file make them yourself 
we want to encourage a world of creators of inventors of contributors because this world that we live in this interactive world of ours 
so go ahead and start inventing 
thank you 
applause 
had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects 
but the coolest project i ever worked on was around this guy this guy's name is tense tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in 
he came home from a run one day and said dad my legs or tingling and that was the onset of als 
so temps is now completely paralyzed 
he only has use of his eyes i was exposed to him 
a company that does design and animations obviously graffiti is definitely intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world 
so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony and attempts and his cause 
so i went and met with his brother and father and said we're going to give you this money what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again i just want to be able to communicate with him to be able to communicate with me and i said well wait a second isn't that i've seen stephen hawking don't all paralyzed people have that ability to communicate via these devices and he said no we're unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance you can actually do that at that these devices aren't accessible to people and i said well how do you actually communicate and he said we run at the germans in the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that's how they communicate so run their finger along 
as best i can 
how can that be 
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash 
committed to his brother and his father right then and there and here's the deal tony's going to speak we're going to get him a machine and we're going to figure out a way for him to do as art again 
because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in them is unable to communicate it 
so i spoke at a conference couple of months after that 
these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project the light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just registers the negative space 
so they go around and do art installations like this 
all the things that go up there they said there's a life cycle 
first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with cuss words that it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art 
but there was always a life cycle presentation 
so i went home and i was having dinner with my wife and was telling about this and we were like well wait a second if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don't we figure out a way for attempts to control the laser and he can do graph again without the awesome 
so that started the journey 
about two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of kind of moving things around we'd accomplished a couple of things 
one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies and we actually got tempt a machine that lead and communicate stephen hawking machine which was awful 
and he is seriously one of the funny column yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you're like i'm just not worthy this guy's so amazing 
the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house 
and my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house 
a lot of our friends that we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall will be removed and graph on the wall 
but for over two weeks we programmed we went to the venice boardwalk my kids got involved my dog got involved and we created this 
so this is called the writer and you can see the description 
is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought into venice beach boardwalk some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack 
we took a ps three camera hacked it open to manage and lead delight and now there's a device that is free you build this yourself we published the code for free you download the software for free 
and now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitation 
but there's no insurance company that can say no there's no there's no hospital that can say no anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw communicate using either 

thank you thank you guys very much that was awesome 
so at the end of the two weeks we went back attempts room 
i love this picture because this is someone else has room and that says 
with all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling 
after over a year of planning two weeks of programming and carved fast and all night session tony drew again for the first time and seven years 
this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system and he's looking over his life support system 
with kicked his bed so that he could see 
we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital 
he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and it's just like you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was 
the funny thing is we had to break into the parking lot to so we totally felt like we were legit and the whole grafting 

so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said that was the first time i've drawn anything for seven years i feel like i've been held underwater and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i can breathe and asked 

so that's kind of our battle cry 
will just keep that's what keeps us going and keeps us develop 
and we've got such a long way to go with this 
this is an amazing device but it's the equivalent of an etch a sketch 
when someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserved so much more 
so we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger 
since that time we had all kinds of acknowledgment 
we want a bunch of awards 
remember it's free none of us are making money on this thing 
it's all coming out of our own pocket 
so the words were like oh this is fantastic armstrong twittered about us and then in december of time magazine honor this is one of the top fifty inventions of two thousand and ten 

coolest thing about this and this is what kind of completing the whole circle isn't in april of this year at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there's going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and are the streets is going to have pretty much the bad assets of the street art scene banks the shepard fairey cause all of these guys will be there 
camps going to be on the show 

so basically this is my point if you see something that's not possible make it possible 
everything in this room was impossible this stage this computer this mike the eyewriter was impossible at one point 
make it possible everyone in this room 
i 'm not a programmer never done anything with ocular recognition technology but i just recognized something and associate myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen 
this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something that you feel that needs to be done if not now then when 
not me 
thank you 

would you like to be better than you are 
suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you can get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker 
or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self confident 
how about living longer with good health 
or perhaps you're one of those who has always yearned for more creativity 
which one would you like the most 
which would you like if you could have just one creativity 
how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good 
how many would opt for memory 
quite a few more how about fitness few less what about longevity the majority 
that makes me feel very good as a doctor 
if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible 
evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference but i want to give you today one doctors take on the subject 
the great twentieth century geneticist p g dubbed jansky who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at catherine shelters book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future 
is another look at the tree of life 
in this picture i put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment 
the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in 
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago 
in the interval they've been perhaps twenty or twenty five different species of hominids 
some have come and gone 
we have been here for about one hundred and thirty thousand 
years it may seem like were quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much 
do you realize that we can take advantage in commandeered the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics 
is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas 
speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body 
and maybe ten times more 
think of it when anthony dimasi last about your self image do you think about the bacteria 
our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria 
it's warm it's dark its moist it's very cozy 
and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part 
it's really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rushed to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life 
they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases 
but what will come in the future 
are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species 
or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment 
well let's take a step back in time to the big bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of pro life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi celled organisms perhaps as much as eight hundred or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last one hundred and thirty thousand 
for years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoy 
applause 
when i was a freshman in college i took my first biology class 
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology 
i became enamored of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life of single celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells 
but at the time multi celled organisms come online things start to change 
sexual reproduction enters the picture 
very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable 
in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters an evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction 
now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought ok sex death sex death that for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing year as i've come to have increasing doubts 
come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his nineties 
one night there's a knock at his hotel room door 
he answered the door 
standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl 
looks at him and says i'm here for super sex that's fine says george i'll take bar soup 
applause 
i came to realize as a position that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different 
i was trying to preserve the body i wanted to keep us healthy i wanted to restore health from disease 
wanted us to live long and healthy lives 
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation 
from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea 
but i think we would all understand the sediment that woody allen expressed when he said i don't want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve it through not die 

evolution does not necessarily favored the longest lived 
it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest 
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment 
that is the sole test of survival and success 
at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce a fish where they are soon need cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them 
so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase i would say that there are a number of possibilities 
the first is that we will not evil 
we have reached a kind of equitable 
the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population 
secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it 
and by the way we integrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place 
second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature 
the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable 
as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way 
but there's a third possibility and enticing intriguing and frightening possibility 
i call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make 
how could this come about 
how could it be possible that we would do this 
consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring 
bear in some cultures choosing to have more males than females 
not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family or choose 
also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases 
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke 
wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes 
if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible 
the human genome project started in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and it took thirteen years 
it costs two point seven billion dollars 
a year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months 
today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and in the space of about two 
week it won't be very long before the reality will be the one thousand dollar human genome and it will be increasingly available 
for everyone just a week ago the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what francis arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cells fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell or sell potentially capable of becoming any cell in 
these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses 
believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant 
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco 
these are all reality today and the future will be ever more possible 
imagine then just to other little changes 
can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring 
what if you could change the sperm and the over or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer 
who doesn't want healthier children 
then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory 
why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the wattson machine 
why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer 
why not live longer 
these will be irresistible 
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution 
we will take a process that normally might require one hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to one thousand years and maybe even in the next one hundred years 
because these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before 
will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder 
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us 
will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile 
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face 
in most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that will need to make these choices wisely 
for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us 

applause 
battling to everybody and i got some good to show you think about this is the pixel a flying 
is what we call in our lab sensible design 
let me tell you a bit about it 
if you take this picture i'm italian or each and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i'm showing you this is that some very interesting happened in formula one racing over the past couple of decades 
now some time ago if you wanted to in formula one race you take a budget and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car 
if the car and driver weren't good enough then you win the race 
today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this sunday monitors the card in real time has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitted this information into the system and then processing it in using it in order to go back to the car with the decisions and changing things in real time information is collected this is what in engineering terms you could call them real time control system 
basically it's a system made of two components sensing and an actuating component 
what 's interesting today is that real time control system are entering starting to enter into our lives 
our cities over the past few years just had been blanketed with networks electronics 
becoming like computers in open air 
computers in open air decided to respond in a different way to be able to be sent into be actually 
if we fix it is actually it's a big deal 
adjusting as an aside i wanted to mention cities are only two percent of the earth's class but they are fifty percent of the world's population 
seventy five percent of the energy consumption up to eighty percent of c two emissions 
able to do something we'd sit is that it's a big deal 
beyond cities all of this sensing evacuating is entering our everyday objects 
from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer 
is called talk to me with our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us 
in a certain sense it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both his sensor into nachtwey 
it is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there 
in a certain sense it's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end he said that he took the hammer through the moses attributes he'll see small chip underneath inside that shouted but a badly 
why don't you talk with today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us 
show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating 
blitzer sensing well the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab 
it was a four and a half years ago in italy 
what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time it had been deployed when all across the world that's a cellphone network news anonymous and aggregated information from the network that's collected anyway by the operator is not to understand how the city works 
with summer was a lucky summer two thousand and six 
when italy won the soccer world cup 
some of you might remember was italy and france playing and then the dan at the end head back 
and anyway italy won again 

and now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network 
here you see the city 
see the colosseum in the middle the river tiber it 
this morning before the match 
the timeline on the top 
early afternoon people here and they're making calls and moving 
the match begins silence france scores italy scores halftime people make a quick call and go to the bathroom second half into normal time 
first overtime cycle 
down to head back in a moment italy wins yeah well here tonight everybody went to celebrate in in the sanctuary 
so the big peak 
following day again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team in the prime minister at the time 
everybody moved down 
the image at a place called to come asimo were since roman times people go to celebrate the big parking received a peek at django today 
well that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago 
another quick example about sensing it's about not about people but about things we using consume 
well today we know everything about where our objects come from 
so this is a map that shows you all the chips that for me mac computer how they came together 
but we know very little about where things go 
so in this project we actually develop some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system 
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped in seattle just over a year ago to tag what they were thrown away different type of things is you can see here things able to throw away any way 
when we put a little chip tag onto the trash and then started following 
here are the results we just have to 

from seattle after one of the the with this information we realize there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system 
we can actually do the same thing which matchless energy 
beast data was not available before 
but a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening 
but the other thing is that we believe that actually if we see every day that the cap were thrown away it doesn't disappear he still somewhere on the planet into plastic both were thrown away every day a few stays there and we showed it to people then we can also promote some behavioral change 
so that was the reason for the project 
my colleague at mit assaf biderman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other things wonderful things we can do with sensory but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning and that's actuating our environment 
first project that is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza spain 
we started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that spain in southern europe can be beautiful tradition of using watering public space in architecture in the question was how could technology new technology be added today 
one of the ideas was developed at mit and worship was imagined good despite and you got valves solenoid valve tabs opening and closing 
can you create like a water curtain with pictures made a while 
those pictures for and you can write on it you can show patterns images texts 
you can approach it and you will open up to let you jump through as you see in this image 
we presented this may have been joke you like it very much and we got a commissioned to design a building again chance of the extra 
we called the digital water pavilion 
and the whole building is made of water 
but there's no doors or windows but when you approach it it will open up to let you in the room forces cover with water 
this would be to win if you want to minimize flashy new can actually lowered her or it could close the building and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case 
these days are always getting during the winter when they take the roof down with people who have been done and say you know the demolished the building and not been demolished just when it goes down to the architecture almost disappear 
the building working 
we see the person puzzled about what was going on inside 
it was myself trying not to get wet testing the sensors adult when the water 
well i should tell you what happened one night when all of the same sort of stopped working 
but actually that night it was even more fun 
the kids from cycles are came to the building because the wealth engaging with the building became something different 
anymore rebuilding it would open up to let you in but it needed was still make cuts in holes through the water and you had to jump without getting 

for us was very interesting because as architects engineers as designers we always think about how people will use the things for design 
but then reality he's always unpredictable 
the beauty of of doing things that are used and interact with people 
here is an image of the building with the physical pixels the pixels made a water and then projections something 
this will lead us to think about the following project i'll show you now 
imagine those peaks that could actually start flying 
imagine you could have smaller helicopters that moving the air in each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost as a cloud that can move in space 
peers did 

so imagine one helicopter like the one we saw before moving with others in synchrony so you can have this cloud 
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this irregular configuration in two dimensions 
for in regular but in three dimensions were the thing to change the light fixtures position 
you can play with the different types 
imagine your screen could just appear and different skies cato sizes different type of resolution 
but then the whole thing can be said three d kind of cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many many directions 
the real flyfire controlling gunned down from the regular readers before 
when you turn on the light actually you see this so the same we saw before 
imagine each of them and controlled by people 
you can have each pixel having an input comes from people from people's movement or so and so 
i wanted to show something here for the first time 
we've been working with the roberta bali one or two days the ballet dancer twilight metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan in actually capture his movement in three d in order to use it as an input 
flyfire and here you can see robert 
pc and the elected pictures to defend resolution being captured 
three d scanning in real time and motion capture 
so you can reconstruct the whole movement 
can go all the way to 
but then once you have the pictures then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation 
we want to use this as one possible inputs for life 
the i wanted to show you the last project we are working on it 's something we're working on for the london olympics 
it's called the cloud 
achilles imagined that again we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment in almost doing what we call cloud raising like barn raising but with the cloud 
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one 
i think what is remarkable to tap into the past couple of years is that over the past couple of decades we went from the physical world to the digital ones 
this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet 
today for the first time in the obama campaign showed us that we can go from the digital world from the self organizing power of networks to the physical one 
it can be in our case we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol 
some can build in a city 
but tomorrow he can be in order to tackle today's pressing challenges think about climate change or two emission how we can go from the digital world to the physical 
so the idea that can we actually involved people in doing this thing together collectively 
the cloud is is a cloud again made of pixels in the same way is a real clout is a live images particles 
those particles and water where our cloud is a cloud of pixels 
physical structure in london but covered with pixels 
if you can move inside different types of experiences 
so you can actually see from underneath that sharing domain moments for the olympics in two thousand and twelve and beyond a really using it as a way to connect with the community 
so both physical cloud into the sky and something you can go to the top like a london's new mountaintop you can enter inside it 
the kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go through it 
thank you 

my name is on an eighteen month ago i had another job at google and i pitched the idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss was actually here and she allowed me to do it and it took eighteen months a lot of fun negotiations and stories i can tell you with seventeen very interesting museums from nine countries 
but i'm going to focus on the demo 
but a lot of stories about why we did this 
i think my personal story is explained rates simply in the slide and access 
i grew up in india 
had a great education and not complaining but i didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks 
when i started traveling and go into these museums i started learning a lot 
while working at google i try to put the desire to make it more accessible with technology together 
so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this 
probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch 
so simple you come to google art project dot com you look around all these museums 
because the uffizi you've got the moma the hermitage the right angle 
going to actually get to one of my favorites the metropolitan museum of art in new york 
cubism going in simple 
click and bang you're in this museum 
it doesn't matter where you are bombay mexico it doesn't really matter 
if you move around you have fun 
we want to navigate around the museum 
open plan up and in one click jump 
there you want to go to the end of the corridor keep going have fun explore 
applause 
signs that haven't come to the best 
applause 
so now i'm in front of one of my favorite painting the harvesters by peter bruegel at the met 
plus sign 
the museum has given up the image you click on it 
this is one of the images 
so this is all the metadata information 
for those of you who are truly interested or not you can click this but i'm going to click this off right now 
this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology 
so this image for example has close to i think around ten billion pixels 
i get a lot of people asking me what do you get for ten billion pixels so i'm going to try and show you what you really get for ten billion pixels 
you can zoom around very simply 
you see some fun stuff happening here 
i love this guy who's expression is priceless 
but but then you really want to go deep 
so i started playing around and i found something going on over here 
hold on 
some interesting went in and i started noticing that these kids actually beating something 
i did a little research spoke to a couple of my contacts with the met and actually found out that this is a game called school which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday 
apparently it was quite popular 
i don't know why they did it but i learned something about it 
now just really deepened you can really get to the cracks 
just to give you some perspective i'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get 
is where we were and this is the painting 

the best is yet to come so let's just quickly jumped into the moma again and yeah 
so another one of my favorite the starry night now the example i showed you was all about finding detail 
but what if you'd want to see brushstrokes 
what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece zoom in you really go and i'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and i'm really going to get to the cracks 
this is the starry night i think i've never seen this before 
i'm going to show you my other favorite feature 
with a lot of other stuff here but i don't have time 
the real cool part 
called collections 
if anyone a few anybody doesn't matter if you're rich or poor if you have a fancy house doesn't matter 
you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images 
simply you go in and i've created called the power of zoom you can just zoom around 
the ambassadors based in the national gallery 
you can annotate the stuff send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces 
so i think in conclusion for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google 
it doesn't in my opinion even come from the museums 
we should say that 
it really comes from these artists 
that 's been my humbling experience and 
i mean i hope and as digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represented properly online 
the biggest question i get asked nowadays is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no 
to supplement the experience 
that's it 
applause 
applause 
is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts 
the left half which is the logical side and the right half which is the intuitive 
if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain 
for example this would be somebody who is completely logical 
this would be someone who's entirely intuitive 
so where would you put your brain on the scale 
some of us may have opted for one of these extremes but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time 
felt like there mutually exclusive or anything 
it can be logical and intuitive 
i consider myself from these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas 
but at the same time we need to get to your intuition to actually make the experiments work 
so how do we develop this intuition 
well we like to play with stuff 
so without and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition 
from there and really you do the same thing 
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time 
he even sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it 
and i remember watching and kid playing on a car staff 
he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over 
but i bet playing with this karstadt time a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place 
so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist 
would be a terrible model for a particle physicists because they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles 
and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like that can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time 
and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics 
so that's where physics was at a few years ago you need a quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles 
but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us 
didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe is just because i don't play with particles very often 
i play with them sometimes but not very often 
i have never seen them i mean nobody's ever seen a particle 
it didn't sit well with my logical side either 
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then everything just follow quantum mechanics 
i don't see any reason why it shouldn't 
so i feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday objects also follows quantum mechanics 
so a few years ago i set off to do just that 
so i made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition 
so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip 
you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle 
this piece of metal and be talking about in a minute 
is a photograph of the object 
and here and zoom in a little bit 
we're looking right there in the center 
here 's a really really big close up look he's metal 
so we're looking at his little chunk of metal and shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge 
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went to a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours 
for the last step ahead to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device 
device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition but it needs a little help to do it 
let me give you an analogy 
uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator 
when i'm an elevator although and do all sorts of weird things but then other people get on board and i stopped doing those things because i don't want to bother them and frankly scare them 
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way 
fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room 
and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we're going to kick out all the other passengers 
and so that's what we did we turn off the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air cooled down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero 
all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however at one 
we measured its motion 
we found it was moving and really weird ways 
instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating in the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows 
by giving it a gentle nudge were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something as only allowed with quantum mechanics 
so what i'm telling you here is something truly fantastic 
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time 
so let's think about the atoms 
one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal or just sitting still at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down 
it was only a precise times and an airline 
for the rest of the time to localize 
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places 
i think this is really cool 
applause 
with locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because check this out the different in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you 
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time chunk of metal can be in two different places that then why not 
i mean this is just my logical side talking 
so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be late 
how would your consciousness handle your body being to localized in space 
but there's one more parts of the story 
when we warmed up and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw the piece of metal was still there in one piece 
so i had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space 
here a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected 
that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that it's deeper 
those connections your connections to all the things around you literally define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics 
thank you 
applause 
jesse and this is my suitcase 
but before i show you what i've got inside i'm going to make a very public confession and that is an outfit obsessed 
i love finding wearing and more recently photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for everything all occasion 
but i don't buy anything new 
i get all my clothes second hand from flea market enter a store thank you for a second hand shopping allow me to reduce the impact my wardrobe have on the environment and on my wallet 
i get to meet all kinds of great people my dollar usually go to a good cause i look pretty unique and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt 
what am i gonna find today 
gonna be my thigh 

what i liked the color will be under 
twenty dollars if all the answers are yes i feel as though 
i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i pack for this exciting week here at ted 
when somebody with all these outfits bring with her 
so i'm going to show you exactly what i abroad 
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that fit 
exactly one week's worth of unease is all i put in my suitcase 
he was betting that i'd be able to find everything else i could possibly want to wear once i got here to palm springs 
since you don't know me as the woman walking around in her underwear that means i found a few things 
i really love just show you my week's worth of outfits right now 
that don't get it and i'm also going to tell you a few the life lessons that believe it or not i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new 
let 's start with sunday 
so i called a shiny tiger you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great 
you can almost always looked phenomenal for under 
fifty dollars this whole outfit including the jacket cockney fifty five and it was the most expensive thing that i wore 
entire week monday color 
it 's almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red paint you are happy you're going to attract other happy people to you 
q day fitting in a way overrated 
i spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in 
adjust the who you are 
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people they will not only get it they will appreciate it 
wednesday embrace your inner child 
sometimes people tell me that i look like i'm playing dress up or that i remind them of their seven year old 
i like a smile and say thank you 
thursday competence is key 
if you think you look good in something you almost certainly do 
if you don't think you look good in something you're also probably right 
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out 
but it wasn't until i turned thirty i really got with this myth 
and i'm going to break it down for you for just a second 
if you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out there is no look that you can't pull off 
so there's no excuse for any of us here in this audience 
we should be able to rot anything we want to rock 
applause 
friday a universal truth five words for you gold sequins go with everything 
filing saturday developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word 
been proven time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i'm wearing and we've had great conversations 
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase 
so before i go home to brooklyn i'm going to donate everything back 
because the lesson i'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go 
i don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there are always going to be another crazy colorful shiny outfit just waiting for me if i put a little love in my heart and look 
thank you very much 


in two thousand and seven i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development 
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents 
and now we're a long way away from that goal right now 
there are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them 
but the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them 
so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities 
this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities 
but just substitute apartment building for cities imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren't there yet 
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions and all the existing apartments 
but you know what you'd run into those apartments in the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction 
so it's extremely hard to do all those additions 
but you could go out someplace brand new build a brand new apartment building as long as the rules there were ones which facilitated construction rather than getting in the way 
so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name charter cities 
later i learned that about the same time javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras 
they knew that about seventy five thousand hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things 
ponderous at one point javier said octavio what if we took some of our empty land what do we just gave it to an embassy give some to the u s embassy give somebody to the canadian embassy and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada are the rules of the united states they could go get jobs do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the us 
summer two thousand and nine honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis 
the next regularly scheduled election pepe lobo one in a landslide on a platform that promised reform but reconciliation as well 
he asked octavio to be his chief of staff 
meanwhile i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal 
it through a process of refinement trial and error a lot of user testing i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials 
the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders 
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies but it takes technologies and rules to get progress and it's usually the rules that hold us back 
in the fall of two thousand and ten a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the ted 
he showed it to javier they called me they said let's present this to the to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room 
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost 
i use this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city noticed land it's worth thousands of dollars in some cases per square meter 
but it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch that 

so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in to go live under those rules or not 
so i was asked by the the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project this is important this could be the way forward for our country 
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth 
so i presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big 
this is a picture of denver and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver 
airport alone and covers more than one hundred square kilometers 
so i was trying to persuade the hundreds if you build a new city you've got to start with a site that's at least a thousand square 
kilometers that's more than two hundred and fifty one hundred thousand acres everybody applauded politely the faces in the audience were very serious 
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said professor romer thank you very much for a lecture but maybe we could watch that 
got it here on my laptop so i sat down and they played 
it got to the essence which is that a new city could offer new choices for people 
be a choice of a city you could go to which could be in honduras instead of hundreds of miles away in the north 
it also involved new choices for leaders 
because the leaders in the government there and honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced 
the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement but i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust 
we went and looked at a site 
his pictures from there 
easily could hold one thousand square kilometers 
shortly thereafter on january nineteen they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions 
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was one hundred and twenty four to one 
all parties all factions in society back this 
could be part of the constitution you actually have to pass it twice in congress 
in february seventeenth they passed it again with another vote of one hundred and fourteen to one 
immediately after that vote on february twenty twenty fourth the delegation of about thirty hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business 
one is south korea 
this is a picture of a big new city center this being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston 
if everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permits 
the other place that's very interested in city building a singapore 
actually built to cities already in china and are preparing the third 
so if you think about this practically here's where we are 
it got a site there are already thinking about the site for the second city 
put in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in and also an external legal system one country is already volunteered to let its supreme court the quarter final appeal for the new judicial system there 
designers and builders of cities who are very interested 
dave and can bring with them some financing 
but the one thing you know that they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants 
there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas especially in a place where the free trade zone and there's lots of people who'd like to go there 
around the world there are seven hundred million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now 
a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states 
for many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to go to get enough money and even pay for food or clothing 
sadly sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen in some cases for a decade 
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city and honduras 
to build a dozen of these or one hundred of these around the world 
what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents 
is an idea worth spreading 
my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you ted 

i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of nine hundred and seventy nine on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby 
so two couples each conceding one baby 
and i don't want you to spend too much time imagining that consumption because if you can imagine that consumption you're not going to listen to me though just imagine that for a moment 
in this scenario i want you to imagine that in one case the sperm is carrying a y chromosome meeting that x chromosome of the egg 
in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg 
both viable both take off 
will come back to these people later 
so i wear two hats in most of what i do 
the one hat i do history of anatomy 
historian by training and what i studied in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning human bodies animal bodies how they dealt with bodily fluids concepts of bodies how they thought about bodies 
we hadn't had that i've worn in my work is as an activist as a patient advocate or i say as an impatient advocate for people who are patients or doctors 
in that case what i've worked with his people who have body types that challenge social norms 
some of what i've worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body 
i worked on and people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical 
a lot of what i've worked on his people who have a typical sex so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types 
as a general term we can use the term intersects for this 
interests that comes in a lot of different forms 
so i'll just give you a few examples of the type of ways you can have sex than standard for male or female 
so in one in ten you can have somebody who has an x y chromosome will basin and that s why gene on the y chromosome test tells the proto gonads which we all have in the fetal life to become 
so in the fetal life those testes are pumping out testosterone 
but because this individual lack receptors to hear that testosterone the body doesn't react to the testosterone 
within her called androgen insensitivity syndrome so lock the levels of testosterone but no reaction to 
as a consequence the body develops more along the female typical path 
when the child is born she looks like a girl 
the girl she is raised as a girl 
often not until she hits puberty and she is growing and developing breasts but she's not getting her period that somebody figures that something's up here 
they do some tests and figure out that instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus she actually as testes inside and she has a y chromosome 
it was important to understand as you may think of this person is really being male but they're really not 
female like male have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands 
in the back of our body 
the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone 
most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don't actually know my makeup and i think i'm probably typical most females like me are actually androgen sensitive 
we're making androgen and we're responding to androgens 
the consequences that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with androgen insensitivity syndrome 
in fact is really complicated it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the effects spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place 
another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was nineteen years old who was born a boy raised a boy had a girlfriend had sex with his girlfriend had a life is the guy and i just found out that he had ovaries and the uterus inside 
what he had with an extreme form of the condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
he had xx chromosomes and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created essentially a masculine hormonal environment 
the consequences genitals were masculinzed his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones 
he was born a boy nobody suspected anything 
it was only when he had reached the age of nineteen that it began to have enough medical problems actually for menstruating internally that doctors figured out that in fact he was female internally 
so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersect 
some people who had xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it 
we are not exactly sure why that happened 
so thanks can come in lots of different varieties 
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies whether it's dwarfism or it can join twinning or and intersex type are often normalized by surgeons is not because they'd actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health 
in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy 
the ramp and they're often subject to various kinds of surgery because they threaten our social categories 
center has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity 
so we had a contract that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an african anatomy in terms of your history 
we have a terribly simplistic idea 
when we're faced with a body that actually present that something quite different startled that in terms of those 
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism 
and our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of 
one can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body 
where i ran into the most kind of heat from this most recently with last year when the south african runner caster semenya had intersects called into question at the international games in berlin 
i 've had a lot of journalists calling asking me which is the tests are going to run that will tell us whether or not captures the many is male or female and i had to explain to the journalist there isn't such a test 
in fact we now know the effect is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for it between male and female or between male and intersex fino and intersects we actually draw that line on nature 
so what we have is a situation where the farther as time goes the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought it is stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fun than we thought 
not just in terms of sex 
also in terms of race which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed 
as we look we get into all sorts of sort of uncomfortable areas 
we look for example about the fact that we share at least ninety five percent of our dna with chimpanzees 
what are we to make of the fact that will differ from him only really by a few nucleus 
as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic 
so we're seeing it in all sorts of places in human life 
one of the point where we're seeing it for example in our culture today in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life 
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life 
we have very difficult conversations nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine and that the question of when somebody debt 
pastor and thatcher had never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead 
both its take a feather and companies know that if a twitch they didn't bury them yet 
it had stopped twitching you bury them 
but today we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings 
the consequences were stuck with having struggled with is really difficult question about who's dead and this leads to a really difficult situation where we don't have pushed temple categories those we've had before 
you might think that all the breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy 
the political progress i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit that it makes me nervous 
understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me ten 
and it needs to be cancer in the point of view and thinking about democracy 
so in order to tell you about that tension that have to first admit that i'm a huge fan of the founding fathers 
i know they were racist i know they were sexes but they were great 
they were so brave bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that she the musical seventy and seventy six every few years and it's not because of the music which is totally forgettable 
because of what happened in seventy and seventy six with the founding fathers 
the founding fathers were from my point of view the original anatomical activists and this is why 
what they rejected what an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for two hundred years 
so as you will recall what our founding fathers were rejecting with the concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy 
monarch of the old world didn't have a concept of dna but they did not a cognitive birthright 
cognitive blue blood 
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth 
the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was all men are created equal they leveled the playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference in anatomy and that was a really radical thing to do 
they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together 
that was democracy growing up but it will go off and science growing up at the same time 
cleric you look at the history of the founding fathers a lot of them were very interested in science and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world 
we were moving away from supernatural explanations and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power were transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright 
we're moving towards a naturalistic concept 
look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature's god 
if they don't talk about god and god's nature 
we 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are 
so as part of that they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality 
in doing so they were really standing up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement for the future 
they didn't think of it that way but they did it for us and it was great 
so what happened years afterwards 
what happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and that the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to me that we shouldn't have the right to vote the right to full citizenship the right to own property etc etc and women successfully argued that 
next came the successful civil rights movement where we found people like sojourner truth talking about a woman we find men on the the marching lines of the civil rights movement thing i am a man again people with color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy again successfully 
we see the same thing with a disability rights movement 
the problem is of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why do we maintain certain divisions 
i want to maintain some divisions anatomically in our culture 
for example i don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human 
i don't want to give up entirely on anatomy 
i don't want to think five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry 
so there are some anatomical divisions that makes sense to me and that i think we should retain 
but the challenge is trying to figure out which when they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning 
so let's go back to those two being conceived at the beginning of this talk 
we have to being conceived in the middle of nine hundred and seventy nine and the exact same day 
imagine one of them mary is born three month prematurely so she's born on june 
by contrast is born at term so he was born on march first nine hundred and eighty 
simply by virtue of the fact that mary was born prematurely three month she comes into all sorts of right three months earlier than henry does the right to confront in fact the right to vote the right to drink 
henry have to wait for all of that it's not because he was actually any difference in age biologically except in terms of when he was born 
we find other kinds of weird enough in terms of what their rights are 
henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven't told you that he's the x y one by the virtue of being assumed to be male it now liable to be drafted which married does not have to worry about 
meanwhile cannot in all the state kind of fame right that henry has been all the faith namely the right to marry 
henry can marry in every state a woman but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman 
so we have these anatomical categories look for things that are in many ways certain problematic unquestionable 
the question to me become what do we do as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy that we reached the point where we have to admit that a democracy and it's been based on anatomy might start falling apart 
i don't want to give up the science but at the same time a kind of feel sometimes like the fire was coming out from under us 
so where do we go 
theme like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position 
so for example texters peasant one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a y chromosome and what it means to marry woman means you do have a y chromosome now in practice they don't actually have people for their chromosomes 
but this is also very bizarre because of the story i told you that beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome 
we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king he offers something of a solution in his i have a dream speech 
he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character moving beyond anatomy 
i want to say yeah that sounds like a really good idea but in practice how do you do 
how do you judge people based on the content of character 
i also want to point out that i'm not sure that is how we should distribute right in terms of humans because i have to admit their thumb golden retrievers but i know that are probably more deserving of social services and from yemen by now 
i want to say there are probably also even from yellow labrador that i know that are more capable of informed intelligent mature decisions about sexual relations and some forty year old that i now 
how do we operationalize the question of content of character 
it turns out to be really difficult 
part of me also wonders what are the content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future able to defeat with an mri 
we really want to go there 
i 'm not sure where we go 
what i do know is that it seems really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue democracy 
we've done a really good job struggling with democracy and i think we would do a good job in the future 
we don't have a situation that iran has for example where a man who sexually attracted to other men libel to be murdered unless he's willing to submit to effect change in which case he's allowed to live 
we don't have that kind of situation 
and i'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with a surgeon i talk to a few years ago who had brought over a third of conjoined twins in order to separate them partly to make a name for himself 
but when i was on the phone with them asking why he was going to do the surgery this is a very high risk surgery his answer was that it has other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this 
response humans will have you considered political asylum instead instead of separation surgery the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them to have to be changed for the sake of the state 
so i think we have to be in the lead 
well just a close i want to suggest to you that i've been talking a lot about the fathers 
i want to think about the possibilities of what demography might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mothers 
why do something a little bit radical for a feminist and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insight that can come from different kind of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups 
for years because i've been interested in intersect they both have been interested in sex difference research 
one of the things i've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world 
and what we know from cross cultural studies is that female on average not everyone but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group 
so if we think about that we have an interesting situation 
for years ago when i was a graduate school one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism and considered myself a feminist as i still do after really strange question 
he said tell me what feminine about feminism and i thought let the dumbest question i've ever heard 
feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there's nothing feminine about feminism but the more i thought about this question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism 
that aims to say there might be something on average different about female brain from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable 
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other 
maybe that's where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think about the individual body in terms of the identity and think more about those relationships 
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union were thinking about what we do for each other 
thank you 
applause 
as an artist connection is very important to me 
through my work i'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected 
i first went to antarctica almost ten years ago where i saw my first icebergs i was in awe 
my heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me 
the icebergs around me were almost two hundred feet out of the water and i can only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year 
icebergs are born when they can often glaciers or break off of ice shelves 
each iceberg has its own individual personality 
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences 
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion 
but it's easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they're isolated that their separate and alone much like we as humans sometimes you yourselves 
but the reality is far from it 
as an iceberg melts i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere 
the iceberg melts it is releasing mineral rich freshwater that nourishes many forms of life 
i approached photographing these icebergs as if i'm making portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again 
it 's not a death when they melt it is not an end but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life 
some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young couple of thousand years old 
some of the ice is over one hundred thousand years 
fold the last pictures i'd like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq 
a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling so here it is 

can see on the left side a small boat it's about a fifteen foot boat and i'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline you can see here begins to roll and the boat is moved to the other side and the man is sending them 
is an average size greenlandic iceberg 
about one hundred and twenty feet above the water or forty meters 
this video is real time 

and just like that the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality 
thank you 
what i do is write for children and probably america's most widely read children's author in fact 
i always tell people that i don't want to show up looking like a scientist 
so you can have me as a farmer or in leathers and no one has ever chose farmer 
here today to talk to you about circles and 
epiphany is usually something you find the drop zone place 
we 've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany 
a painting of a circle 
friend of mine yet that richard bollingbroke 
the kind of complicated circle then i'm going to tell you about 
circle began back in the sixties in high school and stow ohio where i was the class queer 
the guy beaten up bloody every week and the boys room until one teacher saved my life 
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the boys in the teacher's lounge 
we did it in secret she did it for three years 
i had to get out of town 
i had a thumb i had eighty five dollars and i ended up in san francisco california metal lover and back in the eighties found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations 
about three or four years ago i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher mrs postion who said i need to see you i am disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults could you please come to ohio and please bring that man that i know you have found by now and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer and i'd like you to please a quick about this 
well the next day we were in cleveland 
we took a look at her we laugh cry and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice 
founder one week at are there and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary if something we knew how to do 
just as a woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands 
what had happened was the circle closed it had become circle and that epiphany i talked about presented itself 
epiphany is that death is a part of fine 
she saved my life i and my partner saved hers 
that part of life need everything that the rest of life 
it needs truth and beauty and i'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today 
it also needs it needs dignity love and pleasure and it's our job to hand those things out 
cube 
applause 
in the nineteen eighties in the communist eastern germany if you own a typewriter you had to register it with the government 
to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter 
this was done so the government could track where textbooks coming from 
they found the paper which had wrong kinds of thoughts take that tracked down who created that thought 
we in the west couldn't understand how anybody could do this how much this would restrict freedom of speech 
we would never do that in our own countries 
but today in two thousand and eleven if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer 
what is happening to us today 
nobody seems to be making a fuss about 
this is an example of the ways that are wrong governments are using technology against us the citizens 
this is one of the main three sources of online problems today 
will look at what's really happening in the online world we can group the attacks based on the attackers 
we are three main groups we have online criminals like here we have to mr dimitry golubov from the city of keith in ukraine 
the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand 
these guys make money 
use online attacks to make lots of money and lots and lots of 
we actually have several cases of millionaires online multimillionaires who made money with their attacks 
and here's what chechen from the territory estonia 
alfred gonzalez 
steven ones 
viewers who d 
matthew anderson tariq al that were and so on and so on 
these guys make their fortunes online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while they do online banking or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer 
secret service are two months ago froze the swiss bank account of mr some jane right here and that our bank accounts had fourteen point nine million us dollars on it when it's frozen 
mr jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is 
can i claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become a victim of a crime online than here in the real world 
it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse 
in the future majority of crime will be happening online 
the second major group attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money 
motivated by something else motivated by protest motivated by an opinion motivated by the laughs 
groups like anonymous have risen up over the last twelve months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks 
so those are the three main attackers criminals to do it for the money hacktivists like autonomous doing it for the protests but then the last group our nation states governments doing the attacks 
look at cases like what happened it diginotar 
so this is a prime example of what happens when governments attacks against their own citizens 
did you know tar is a certificate authority from the netherlands are actually it was 
it was run into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into 
somebody broke into they acted thorough 
when i asked last week in a meeting with doug government representatives i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack 
his answer was yes 
so how do people die as a result of a hack like this 
well diginotar is a c they sell certificates what do you do with certificates 
you need a certificate if he had a website that has https ssl encrypted services services like gmail 
we all are big part of us use gmail or one of their competitors but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services that they are encrypted over ssl connections to the local government can snoop on their discussions 
except they can if they hacked into a foreign ca at issue rogue certificates 
this is exactly what happened with the case of pigeon homes 
what about erupts arab spring and things have been happening for example in egypt 
in egypt the rioters looted the headquarters of the egypt secret police in april two thousand and eleven and whatever loading the building they found lots of papers 
some of those papers this binder kidal finfisher and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the erupt egypt governments a set of tools for intercepting and in very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country 
so this tool for two hundred and eighty thousand euros to the egypt 
government the company headquarters are right 
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens 
western governments are doing it themselves as well 
for example in germany just a couple of weeks ago the so called starts trojan horse found which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens 
if you are the suspect in a criminal case well it's pretty obvious your phone will be tapped 
but today it goes beyond that 
they will tap your internet connection 
will even use tools like starts croton to infect your computer with a trojan which enables them to watch whole your communication to listen to your online discussions to collect your passwords 
what we think deeper about things like these the obvious response from people should be that okay well that sounds bad but that doesn't really affect me because i'm a legal citizen 
why should i worry 
because i have nothing to hide this is an argument which doesn't make sense privacy is implied privacy is not up for discussion 
it 's not a question between privacy against security 
it 's a question of freedom against control 
while we might trust our government right now right here in two thousand and eleven any writer we'd give away will be given away for good 
do we trust to be blindly trust any future government a government might have fifty years from now 
these are the questions that would have to worry about for the next fifty years 
know how many choices you make in a typical 
week 
but recently did a survey with over two thousand american and the average number of choices that the typical american report making is about seventy in a typical 
day it will also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole 
scientists simply documented all the various calf that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging and making decisions related to the cat 
they found that the average ceo engaged in about one hundred and thirty nine path than a week 
each task with made up of many many many many sub choices of course 
ninety percent of their decisions were made in one thousand nine minutes or less 
only about twelve percent of the decisions they make an hour or more of their time 
about your own choices 
if you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category 
how well do you think you're doing it managing those choices 
today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload problem 
want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions 
they talk about this problem i'm going to have some questions for you and i'm going to want to know your answers 
so when i ask you a question since i'm blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off calories otherwise when i ask you a question and if your answer is yes i'd like you to clap your hands 
for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem thank you 
when i was a graduate student at stanford university i used to go to a very very upscale grocery store and leaf at that time it was truly upscale 
store called breakers and the door and we don't look like going could amusement park 
they had two hundred and fifty different kinds of mustard and vinegars and over five hundred different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this is during a time when we actually used to drink tap water 
the love going to the store but on one occasion i asked myself how can we never buy anything 
their olive oil oil 
head over seventy five different kinds of olive oil including thought there were a lot case that came from a thousand year old olive trees 
i wanted to pay a visit to the manager and i asked the manager model of offering people oldest choice really working and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up every day with cameras ready usually 
we need to do a little experiment and we picked jam for our experiment 
peering through jam 
we had three hundred and forty eight different kinds of jam 
we could have a little pasting booth right near the entrance of the store 
we put out six different flavors of jam or twenty four different flavors of jam and we look at two things first in which case when people more likely to stop ample some games 
people stop when they were twenty four about sixty percent than when there were thick about forty percent 
the next thing we looked at it in which case where people more likely to buy a jar of jam 
and now we see the opposite effect 
people who stopped when i was twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam 
the people who stopped when they were sick well now we thought that thirty percent of them actually bought a jar of jam 
if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to bought a jar of jam if they encountered thick than if they encountered twenty 
choosing not to buy a jar of jam is actually probably good for us at least it's good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects the even in very consequential decisions 
we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best self interest 
for now for the topic of today financial savings 
study that i did with go home now i'm going to describe he was sedated with gore huberman amir communica way jang where we looked at the retirement savings decision of nearly a million americans from about six hundred and fifty plan all in the us and what we looked at whether the number of fun offering available in a retirement savings plan for one k plan does that affect people likelihood to save more for tomorrow 
what we found was that indeed there was a correlation 
so in these plants with about six hundred and fifty seven plan that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to fifty nine different fund offering 
what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was left participation rate 
so if you look at the extreme those plans that offered you to fun participation rate for round in the mid seventies still a lot of times we want it to me 
those plans that offered merely thick the fun participation rate have now dropped to about sixty percent higher 
well it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present even then it has negative consequences 
so for those people who choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid dr equity funds 
with more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market account 
neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well being 
well over the past decade we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices 
were more likely to delay choosing procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest 
more likely to make worse choices worse financial choices medical choices 
more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better 
the main reason for that is because well we might enjoy gazing at those giant wall the mayonnaise mustard vinegars jam fully can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually taking from that stunning display 
what i want to propose to you today are for simple technique technique that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues that you can easily apply in your businesses 
for the first cut you heard it said before but it's never been more true than today that less is more 
people are always upset when i say cut they're always worried they're gonna lose shelf space 
but in fact what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to get rid of those extraneous redundant option well there's an increase in sales there's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience 
when proctor and gamble went from twenty different kinds of head and shoulders to fifteen they saw an increase in failed by ten percent when the golden can't corporation got rid of their ten worst filling cat litter product they saw an increase in profits by eighty seven percent a function of both the increase in sales and lowering of costs 
the average grocery store today offering to forty five thousand 
product the typical wal mart today offered 
in one thousand products but the nine the ninth largest retailer the biggest retailer in the world today is all these and it offers you only fourteen eight hundred products one kind of 
can tomato sauce now in the financial painting for i think one of the best example that has recently come out on how to manage the detroit offering has actually been something that david laibson with a heavily involved in designing which is a program that 
that harbored every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled 
life cycle fund for those people who actually want to choose their given twenty fun not three hundred 
for more fun often people say i don't know 
how to cut their all important choices and the first thing i do is i asked the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can't tell them apart needed 
can you are consumers now before we started our session this afternoon 
cat with gary and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in the audience and all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road 
in the world and the description 
the road and i'd like you 
it read it and now i'm getting a few seconds to read it and i don't want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take carry up on his offer 
anybody who is ready to take him up on the offer that all all right let me do anything more about that you guys knew there was a trick in you now who are ready to go on a trip i think 
where have all right now in new had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it with more real 
second time around because the pictures made it feel more 
real to you which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem 
which is concretization that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice and let the consequences needs to be felt in a vivid sort of way 
a very concrete way why do people than an average of fifteen to thirty thirty percent more when they use an atm card and a credit card 
both the cash because it doesn't feel 
real money and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use and getting people 
nothing more to a study that i did with shlomi benartzi and alessandro fiba thorough we looked at we did a study with people and i envy employees that are all working and i n g and people were all in a fashion where they're doing enrollment for their 
coral one k plan and during a session we kept the fashion exactly the way it used to be but we added 
one little thing the one little thing we added with we asked people can just think that all the positive things that would happen in your life 
q saved more by doing that simple thing that was the increase in enrollment by twenty percent and there was an increase in the amount of people that were willing to save the amount that they're willing to put down into their savings account 
by four percent 
bird technique categorization you know we can handle more categories and 
can handle choices so for example here's the study we did 
and magazine aisle turned out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty one different kinds of magazines for all the way 
six hundred and sixty four 
what if i show you thick hundred magazines and i divide them up into ten categories burton's i show you four hundred magazines and divide them up into twenty category you believe that i have given new more joy and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave 
in the thick thundered because the category tell me how 
held them apart here are two 
and jewelry displayed one is called jazz and the other one is called swing if you think the display on the left to swing and the display on the right in jazz clap your hands 
if you think the one on the left and jazz in the one on the right is swing clap your hands 
a bit more ok now 
on your right the one on the left in chad and one on the right and swing 
the highly neutralist categorization scheme the category need to say something to the tunes are not 
with choice maker and you often see that problem when it comes down to that the long lived 
while these funds who are they actually supposed 
can be informing my fourth technique 
condition for complexity it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we just had taken a little easier where that gradually 
increase the complexity i'm going to show you one example of what 
i'm talking about when to take a very very complicated decisions 
buying a car here in the german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely customers 
make your car going to make sixty different decision completely making 
if your car now these decisions are very and the number of choices that 
offer decision car colors exterior car colored 
fifty six choices endgame 
partnership for choices so now what i'm going to do with i'm going to vary the order in which 
decisions appear to have to the customers are gonna go from high joy fifty six car colors to learn 
choice for gearshift the other half of the customers are going to go from low joy for gear ship than fifty thick art 
colors high choice what am i going 
and look at how 
and engaged you are if you keep hitting the default button per decision that means you're getting overwhelmed let me 
some luna knew what you find is the people that go from high choice to load choice they're hitting that the fault button over and over and over again we're losing them they go from below choice the high joy 
hanging in there 
the same information it's the same 
a number of choices the only thing that i have done and i have bearing the order in which that 
information is presented if i start you off easy i learned 
how to choose even though shooting gear shift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor it feel prepared me for 
how to shoot it gets me excited about this thing product that i'm putting together a more willing can be motivated 
can be engaged so let me recap i have talked about for technique for mitigating the problem of choice overload cut get rid of the extraneous alternatives concretize make it real categorize we can handle more category less choices 
condition for complexity all of these techniques that i'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choice is better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people 
if you are serving because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to beat 
community about choosing and the more were able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice 
part of choosing 
applause 
we have to do something about the culture of peace of the culture of medicine that has to change 
it starts with one physician at me 
maybe i've been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to to do that 
before actually begin my talk let's begin with a bit of baseball 
why not 
near the end we're getting close to two into the world theory 
love baseball that way baseball is filled with some amazing statistics 
and i guess there's hundreds of moneyball that tend to come out all the statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team 
focus on the one that i hope a lot of the hurdle 
it 's called batting average 
so we talk about three hundred a battery that reminded that means that ballplayer batting can safely can safely three times out of ten at that 
hit the ball into the outfield dropped didn't get caught and whoever trying to throw to first base didn't get there in time and the runner estate 
it three times out of ten 
do you know what they call a three hundred here in major league baseball 
it really made an all star 
what they call a four hundred baseball hitter 
somebody hit by the way for a time to take me out of every kid 
legendary has been ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over four hundred during a regular season 
take this back into my world and medicine run a lot more comfortable or perhaps a bit less comfortable after one and planting them 
suppose you have appendicitis referred to a surgeon batting four hundred appendectomy somehow this isn't working out 
suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages into coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that local into a cardiologist who is bad and two hundred on angioplasties 
but you know what 
if she's doing a lot better this year she's on the comeback failed completely seven 
somehow this isn't working 
what i'm going to ask you a question what do you think of batting average or a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner aurora an orthopedic surgeon 
why have hermetic one thousand 
ok now truth in that nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedics proposed 
we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition to be perfect 
never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details about how that's going to happen 
that was the methods that i absorbed when i was in school 
i was an obsessive compulsive students 
in high school classmate once said the prying open with stunning for a blood test and so i did 
i started my little garrett at the nurses resident attorney general hospital not far from here and i memorized everything i memorized in my anatomy class origins and assertions of muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta differential diagnosis obscure and common 
i even knew the differential diagnosis and how to classify renal tubular acidosis 
all the while loves imagine more and more knowledge 
well i graduated with honors come 
i cannot a medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything he knew everything or as much as possible as close to everything is possible that immunized against making mistakes 
it worked for a while until i met his drug 
was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto mrs drucker with broccoli emergency department of hospital where i was working 
at the time i was assigned to cardiologists or cardiology rotation 
it was my job when the emergency call for cardiology conflict that patient in emerge and to report back to my it can 
i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless 
and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound and when i listen to her chest with a stethoscope i can hear cracking down on both sides the told me that she was in congestive heart failure 
this is a condition in which the heart failure instead of being able to pump all look forward some of the blood backs up into the lung belongs to fill up with blood and that's why you have shortness of breath 
that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make 
it needed and i said we're treating aspirin with medications surely to strengthen your heart 
it gave her medications that we call diuretics water filled to get her natasha excess fluid 
over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to build them 
i felt really good 
and that's when i need my first mistake i sent her home 
actually i need to more mistakes 
i sent her home without speaking to my intent 
i didn't pick up the phone and do what i'm supposed to do which is to call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance for himself 
he knew where he would have been able to furnish additional information about 
baby i did it for good reason 
maybe i didn't want to be a high maintenance residence 
i wanted to be so successful is so it will take responsibility fat that that i'm going to do so and i will be able to take care of my attending these patients without even having to contact 
second mistake that i made it worse 
sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside i was trying to sell me goldman not a good idea 
in fact so lacking in confidence was that i've actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker do you think it is ok if she goes home and the nurse thought about it was very matter of factly yeah ok i can remember that like it was yesterday 
so i find the discharge papers and an ambulance came fairness can take her home 
i went back to my work on the world 
all the rest of that day that afternoon i had this kind of knowing feeling in my stomach but i carried on my work 
at the end of the day i packed up to leave the hospital and walk to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don't usually do 
walk through the emergency department on my way home 
it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker the corporate another nurse three words to me that are the three words most emergency physicians i dread 
others in medicine dreaded as well but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly 
with three words are do you remember you remember that patient you sent home the other nurse asked matter of factly she's back and just that 
pushing back all right 
back in the day 
about an hour after she had arrived home after i sent her home she collapsed and her family call nine one one on the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure and fifty which is in severe shock 
when she was barely breathing consumers blue 
emerged step pulled out all the stops 
even medications to raise blood pressure 
he put her on a ventilator 
i was shocked and shaking to the core 
i went through this roller coaster because after they stabilize her she went to the intensive care unit and i hoped against hope that she would recover 
over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up 
versatile brain damage 
the family gathered over the course of the next eight or nine days a resigned herself to what was happening 
developed in one thousand eight mark they let her go mrs drucker away a mother and a grandmother 
they never forget the names of those who die 
that was my first time to be acquainted with that 
over the next few weeks i beat myself up and an experience for the first time the unhealthy shame and exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone isolated not feeling the healthy shaming should feel because you can't talk about it with your colleagues 
that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend major promised never to reveal and you get busted and then you're here best friend confront you and you have terrible discussion at the end of it all that sick feeling guy and say you know i'll never made that mistake again 
community he never make that mistake again 
that kind of shame that being a teacher 
unhealthy shame i'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick and die 
the one that they're not that what you did with that but you are bad 
and it was what i was feeling 
and it wasn't because of my attending he was a dog 
he talked to the family and i'm quite sure who smoothed things over and made sure that i didn't get sued 
i kept asking myself this question 
why didn't i asked my attending 
why did i sent her home 
at my worst moment why why did i make stupid mistakes 
why did i go into medicine 
slowly but surely it lifted 
i began to feel a bit better 
and on a cloudy day there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered maybe i could feel better again 
i made myself a bargain you know that if only i redoubling my efforts to be correct and never make another mistake again please make the voices and they did and i went back to work 
then it happened again 
two years later lived in attending in the emergency department community hospital just north of toronto and i saw twenty five year old man with a sore throat 
bibby i was in a bit of a hurry 
egypt pointing here 
looked at a struggle a little bit paint 
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin data on his way 
even as he was walking in the door he was still sort of pointing to his throne 
two days later i came to do my next emergency shift and that's when my cheap asked to speak and he quietly in her office 
she said the three words do you remember you remember that patient who saw with a sore throat well it turns out he didn't have a strep throat 
he had a potentially life threatening condition called 
google it but if an infection not of the throat of the upper airway and it can actually have the clothes 
and unfortunately he didn't die 
he was placed an intravenous antibiotic and he recovered after day 
i went through the same period of shame and recrimination and felt cleansed and went back to work until it happened again and again and again 
twice in one emergency shit i missed appendicitis 
that takes some doing especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw about fourteen people at night 
in both cases i didn't send them home and i don't think there was any gap in their chairs 
one i thought had a kidney stone i ordered a kidney x ray were conducted a normal my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed and tenderness in the right lower quadrant called says 
the other one had a lot of diarrhea amniotic fluid to rehydrate him and asked my calling to reassess 
he did when he noticed and tenderness and the right lower quadrant 
both cases they have their operations and they did ok 
each time it would be 
i'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice many of my colleagues say which is totally as some of my doozies have been in the last five years 
alone machine and non support 
and here's the problem if i can't come clean and and talk about my mistakes if i can find the still small voice tells me what really happened how can i share with my colleagues 
how can i teach them what i did that they don't understand 
i will walk into a room right now until i have no idea what you think of me 
when was the last time you heard about somebody talk about daily rapper failure after failure 
you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other dr virginia twenty hear somebody talking about the wrong 
if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleagues and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i've just told you right now i probably wouldn't get him to those stories before they will start to get really uncomfortable somebody would crack a joke he changed the subject and when we move on 
that i and my colleagues one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the long leg in my hospital to lead the might have trouble making eye contact with that person 
the system that we have 
to complete denial of the state 
the system in which there are two kinds of good position those who make mistakes in those who don't those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can those who have lousy outcome those who have breakup 
and it's almost like an immunological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person 
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine will only be left with but a statesman 
but there are two problems with that 
in my twenty years we saw a medical broadcasting in journalism i've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors and to learn everything i can't from one of the first article i wrote the toronto star to my show white coat black art and what i've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous 
we work in a system where errors happen every day one in ten medications right or wrong medication given in hospital where the wrong dosage for hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous causing havoc and 
in this country as many as twenty one thousand canadians die of preventable medical 
errors in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it 
in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren't ferreting out the problem 
and here's the thing 
hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years we can't keep up with it 
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive 
we can't get rid of it 
we have our cognitive bias so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with with chest pain 
take the same patient with chest pain make them moist and careless and put a little bit of alcohol on a graph and suddenly my history laced with contempt 
the same history 
i 'm not a robot i don't do things the same way each time 
my patients on cars they don't tell me their symptoms in the same age time given all that mistakes are inevitable 
so if you take the system and i was taught and without all the error prone health professional well there will be any plane landed 
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their their worst case 
show on white coat black are the habit of saying here's my worst mistake i would say to everybody from paramedics the cheek cardiac surgeon here's my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what about yours and i would point that my brooklyn toward man 
the pupils dilate pretrial than they would look down and swallow hard and started to tell stories 
want to tell their story they want to share their story they want to be able to say don't make a statement that i did what they need is an environment to be able to do that 
what they need is a really defined medical culture 
start with one position at a time 
redefined physician human no she's human except that isn't proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else 
she shares her experience without it 
supportive when other people talk about their mistakes 
she points out other people's mistakes not in a gotcha way but in a loving supportive way so that everybody can benefit 
she works in a culture of that and that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run them they will make your pension plan decline 
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes the human inevitably mate and also fosters loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the healthcare system can actually point out things they could be potential mistakes in is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes were rewarded for coming clean 
findings brian goldman 
redefined physician i'm human i make mistakes story about that but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people 
i still don't know what you think of me but i can live with 
let me close with three words of my own i do 
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be and i thought that since i was among friends here i will tell you what i really think on and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with his amazing jumps and technology that seemed so fast that we can we can barely keep on others 
so i'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology fly and then if you can just turn on the fly the fun 
this is just a random slide that i'd picked out of my file 
when i want to show you is not so much the detail from this line but the general form of 
what happens to be a slider from analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area network 
the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technologies like that were used to sort of a straight line on a semi log curve 
in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude and performance can 
and we're sort of a new thing that we talk about technology on semi log curve 
something really weird going on here 
basically what i'm going to be talking about 
so if you bring up the lights 
i think bring up the light higher because i'm just going to use a piece of paper here 
why do we draw technology curves and from the long term 
the answer is that if i do it on a normal curve let's say this year's time of some sort and this is whatever measure of the technology that i'm trying to grab the grasslands silly go like this and they don't tell us much 
if i graham for instance some other technologies a transportation technology on a semi log curve it would look very stiff but it would look like a flat line 
when something like this happen anywhere qualitatively changing 
transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology are then day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxicab and be in tokyo in thirty seconds 
movement like that 
nothing president in the history of technology development of this kind of self healing growth where you've got by orders of magnitude every year 
the question that i ask if you look at these exponential curve go on forever 
he just can't possibly keep changing fast fulfill 
one of two things are going to happen 
whether it's going to turn into a classical ask her death until something totally different comes along or maybe it's going to do 
about all i can do 
but i'm an optimist i think it's probably going to do something like that 
so that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition 
we 're sort of unknown line in a transition from the way that the world used to be to some new way that the world 
so what i'm trying to have been asking myself what's this new way that the world 
the new state of the world was heading towards 
because the transition seems very very confusing and we're right in the middle of it 
when i was a kid growing up the future was kind of the year two thousand and people used to talk about what will happen in the year two thousand 
now here's a conference in which people talk about the future and you'll notice that the future is still in about a year 
about four as we go out 
in other words the future has been shrinking one year per year or my whole lifetime 
and i think the reason is because we all feel that this humbling happening there that transition has happened since 
we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out thirty fifty years because everything is so different than a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all 
so what i would like to talk about what that could be what that transition from that we're going through 
in order to do that i'm going to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers 
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things 
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on the timescale of life on earth 
so i think that this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time 
so if you go back about two and a half billion years the earth was this big sterile chunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around 
if you look at the weight of the chemicals can organize we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do 
i think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with ornate i'm going to tell a simple story of when she is that at that time there were a little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them 
some of those groups of oils had a particular combination of chemicals in them which causes them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil 
and those that were like that started to split and divide 
and those were the most primitive forms of cells and visible drops of oil 
but now those drops of oil weren't really live as we have now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals 
every time it divided something different and got on equal division of the chemicals with 
and so every drop of a little bit different 
in fact it robs that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them grew more incorporated more chemicals and divided more 
so those tended to live longer get expressed more 
that sort of just a very simple chemical form of life when things got interesting was when withdrawn learn of a trick of abstraction 
somehow ways we don't quite understand drops learned to write down information 
blender record the information that was the recipe of the fell onto a particular kind of chemical called 
so in other words they worked out in a sort of mine was revolutionary way a form of writing that let them write down what they were so that that way of writing it down could get caught 
the amazing thing is that there were writing seems to have stayed there is some sort of all two and a half billion years ago 
in fact the recipe for us our genes is exactly that same code in that same way of right 
in fact every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters in the sun 
one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes as we can now write things in this case 
and i'm not here a little hundred micrograms of flight counter which i try not to let the security people see at airports but this has entered one identify took this coat the code has standard letters that we used for symbolizing it and i wrote my business card under a piece of dna and amplify the end of the twenty two times 
so if anyone would like one hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and back to everyone in the world and it's right here so i really been an egotist i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room 

so what was the next step 
writing down the dna was an interesting stuff 
currently sells so i kept them happy for another billion years 
then there was a really interesting stuff where things and completely different which is the show started exchanging and communicating information so that began communities themselves 
if you notice that bacteria can actual exchange 
and that's why for instance antibiotic resistance 
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from someone and it went around sort of creating its own dna information with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin accurate and communicate 
what this communication allowed was communities to form that assumptions were in the same boat together and they were synergistic 
they survived or fail together we can be used for the community was very successful only individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution 
the transition point when he's got so close that actually got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one strength 
the next stage of interesting and lived about another billion years 
and at that stage multicellular communities communities have lots of different types of cells working together as a single one 
in fact we're such a multi cellular community 
and lots of cells that are not out for themselves and him 
for your skin cell is really useless without heart cell muscle cell and brain cell phone 
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell for the community which we call an organism 
the next step and happen within the community 
communities themselves again began to extract information and then again building very special structures that did nothing but process information with them 
closer the neural structure 
so neurons with the information processing apparatus for those communities themselves felt 
in fact they began to get specialists and the community and special structures that were responsible for recording understand the learning information 
it was the brain from the nervous system of others community 
and gave them an evolutionary advantage 
because at that point an individual things learning could happen within the time span of a single organism instead of over evolutionary time span 
so an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of proof because of their knickers sinclair 
that could happen within the premise of a single organism whereas before they build those special information processing structures that would have to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by by the individuals dying off that kind of cruel 
so that nervous system built was special information structures tremendously heated up the whole process of evolution 
evolution could now happen within an individual 
learning time 
then what happened with the individual worked out of course tricks of communicating 
for example all the most sophisticated version that we're aware of this human language 
it 's really a pretty amazing invention to think about 
i have a very complicated and messy confused idea in my head 
and i'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically and hopefully constructing a similar method confused idea your head that there's some analogy to 
tell you something very complicated and turning it into sound sequence of sound and producing something very complicated in your brain 
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism 
so in fact what we've done is we have started abstracting out 
we're going through the same level of multicellular organisms have gone through and extracting out residents of recording presenting processing information 
so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction 
computer video to cd rom so on are all are specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information 
all connect together into something that is much bigger and much faster unable to evolve than what we were before 
so now evolution can take place on the scale 
highs little evolutionary example where he did a little bit of evolution of convolution program right before your eyes 
so now we speed it up the time scales once again 
for the first steps and the story that i told you about a billion years of tea 
the next steps like like nervous systems and brains took a few hundred million years 
when the next steps like language and so on but less than a million 
next like electronics seems to be taking only a few decades 
in the process is feeding on itself and the company autocad linux and work on something reinforces its rate of change 
furthermore it changes the search engine 
i think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion occurred 
we're seeing this process feeling back on itself 
i designed computers for a living and i know that mechanisms that i do find computer would be impossible without recent advances in computer 
so right now when i do as i design objects of such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense 
i don't know what every transistor and the connection she thought 
there are billions of dollars 
instead what i do and what the designers thinking machines do we think at some level of abstraction and then handed to the machine and a machine takes a neon but we could ever do much farther and faster than we could ever 
and in fact sometimes it takes a method that we don't even understand 
one method is particularly interesting that i've been using a lot lately evolution itself 
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time 
so for example in the most extreme cases we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instruction 
same computer would you please make one hundred million random sequences of instructions now would you please ran all those random sequences and instructions run all of us program and pick out the ones that can cause us to do what i want and in other words i define what i want 
i want to sort numbers it's a simple example on them 
find the programs that come closer to shore numbers 
so of course random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers so none of them will relate to 
one of them by luck may for two numbers in the right order 
the computer would you please take the ten percent of those random sequences that did the best job save those kill off the rails 
now let's reproduce the ones that sort of numbers that unless reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to facts and take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their sub routine and the children inherit the traits subverted to program 
so i got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs within a little bit better job 
so please repeat that process score of them again 
introduced mutations perhaps and try that again for another generation 
for every one of us generations just takes a few milliseconds 
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer and a few minutes from the complicated cases from a few hours 
by the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect sorting numbers 
in fact there are programs that are much more efficient than programs i have ever written by hand 
if i look at those program i can't tell you how they work 
try looking at them and tell you how they work 
obscure weird programs 
but they did it in a job 
in fact i know i'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job 
their life depended on doing the job 

it was running at seven forty seven with marvin minsky once and others card and said oh look look at this and says this plan has hundreds and thousands of tiny parts working together to make you are safe flight doesn't make it happen 

in fact we now that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets 
so we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's different than the engineering 
as for new things are much more funny than normal engineering lenses for 
and yet we don't quite understand the king said 
so in a sense it's getting ahead 
we are now using those programs to make much faster computers and it will be able to run this process much faster 
feeding back on itself 
but thank you for coming faster and that's why i think it seems so confusing 
all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves 
were taking off 
but we are at a point in time which is analogous to win single celled organisms were running and so on 
where the amoebas and we can figure out what the hell the thing is were created 
we're right at that point of transition 
but i think that there really is something coming along after all 
but i think it's very audi of us to think that early in life and evolution 
i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing 
so lunches coming along and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out 

for instant photography because of course this is a photograph that you can take with camera 
my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of fifteen 
mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a bit different because using the camera the process was in the planning instead 
when you take the photograph with a camera it's just the process ends when you press the trigger 
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place at the right time 
i felt like anyone could do that 
so i wanted to create something different something were to process starts when you press the trigger 
photos like this construction going on along a road but it has an unexpected twist 
despite that entertains the level of reality 
photos like teeth both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of rio 
when a study released i mean photoreal 
because of course it's not something you can capture it really but i always wanted to look like it could have been captured some are as a photograph 
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out to trick 
so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really 
but what the trick that makes it look realistic 
something about a tenth or the colors 
something about the light 
what creates the illusion 
sometimes the perspective is the illusion 
but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be relies on a two dimensional surface 
it 's not really what israelis tickets it's how we what we think looks realistic really 
so i think the basics are quite simple 
teeth as possible of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create an alternate reality 
and let me show you a simple example 
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical object something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world 
but combined in a certain way they can create something that looks three dimensional like it could exist 
but at the same time we know it can't 
so we take our brains because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense 
i think the same process with combining photographs 
it 's just really about combining different realities 
so the things that make a photograph look realistic i think it's the things that we don't even think about the things all around us and our daily lives 
but when combining photographs this is really important to consider because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow 
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result 
as you can see these images aren't really special 
but combined they can create something like this 
so the first rule is the photos combined should have the same perspective 
secondly photos combined should have the same type of light 
these two images both fulfill these two requirements shocked at the same height and in the same type of light 
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish were different images begin and end by making it seamless 
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed 
so by matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images adding photographic defects like depth of field desaturated colors and noise race the borders between the different images make it look like one single image despite the fact that one in which can contain hundreds of layers 
so here's another example one might think that is just an image of a landscape and the lower parts such manipulated 
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations 
i personally think that it's easier to actually create a place them to find a place because then you don't need to compromise with ideas in your head 
but it does require a lot of planning 
and getting this idea during winter i knew that i had several months to planet to find a different locations for the pieces for the puzzle basically 
so for example the fish is captured on a fishing trip 
shores are from a different location 
underwater part is captured in stone 
yeah even turn the house on top of the island ready to make it look more swedish 
so to achieve a realistic result i think it comes down to planning 
it always starts with a sketch an idea 
when it's about combining different photographs 
and here every piece is very well planned 
if you do a good job capturing the photos result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic 
so all the tools are out there and the only thing that limits us is our imagination 

applause 
i would love to talk to you about why many iaaf projects failed 
i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients 
one of the things we did at rutgers university reappointed achieve listening officer 
not on a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and ask patients family relatives what's up 
how could we hope you and we think we like to think that this is one of the major problems why all maybe not all but most of the iaaf project shrill since we stopped listening 
my weight scale 
it 's a very simple thing 
it got one not on off 
and every morning i hope on it 
yes i've got a challenge as you might see 
and i quit my challenge or ninety five kilograms 
but the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever i hop on its sense my data to google health as well 
and it's collected by my general petitioner as well so he can see what my problem in weight not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support us in something like it but also looking backward 
but there's another thing 
some of you might know i got more than four thousand followers on twitter 
so every morning i hope on my weighing scale and before i'm in my car people start talking to me i think you need a light lunch today 

but that's the nicest thing that could happen since this is peer pressure peer pressure used to help patients since this could be useful at least as it could be used to stop smoking 
for patients but on the other hand it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health 
next week it will be soon available there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone over something or other 
people will be able from their homes to take their blood pressure scented into the doctor and eventually share it to others for instance for over one hundred dollars 
this is the point where patients get into position and can collect not only their own control again the captain of the ship but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face like health care costs explosion doubled the amount of things like that make techniques that it's easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in a team 
you could do this with techniques like this but also by crowdsource 
one of the things we did i would like to share with you and reduced by a little video 
forgotten navigation controls in our car 
we may be even got it in a cell phone 
we perfectly nowhere all day atms are just about the city of mastery 
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations 
ensure we could find fast food chains 
but where would be the nearest eighty to help this patient 
we asked around and nobody knew 
nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving id wants to obtain right now 
so what we did we crowdsource the netherlands 
we set up a website and asked the crowd if you see an eddy please submit it tell us where it is challenged when it's open since sometimes in office hours at the close of course 
over ten thousand babies in the netherlands already have 
submitted the next time we took was fine to applications for 
and rebuild an ipad application 
we made an application for layer augmented reality to find these 
whenever you were in a city like maastricht and somebody collapse you can use your iphone and within the next week's ulcer on your microsoft cell phone to find the nearest eighty which can save lives 
as of today we would like to introduce this not only as a day for you which is the product called but also eighty for us 
we would like to start this on a worldwide level 
asking all colleagues of us in the rest of the world colleague universities to help us to find and work and act like a hop to crowdsource all these eddies around the world that whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses might be your own relative or someone just in front of you you can find this 
the other thing we would like to ask is companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these eddies 
might be courier services or cable guys for instance just to see whether the eighty that submitted still is in place 
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better but take control of it 
center 

story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago 
i live in the desert under the starry skies with the sufi finger militarily 
we run conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the mahabharata 
so back in the day when as indians wanted to travel we jump into each area and we zoom across the sky 
we do the same with aeroplane 
back then when arginine the great indian warrior prince when he was thirsty he'd take out a ball he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out 
we do the same withdrew and machine 
the conclusion that became do with that magic had been replaced by machinery and this made me really sad i found myself becoming a little bit of for technophobes 
i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me without tweeting into my friends 
it felt like it felt like technology should enable magic not kill it when 
when i was a little girl my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch 
this piece of fifty year old technology became the most magical thing to me 
it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination 
so i felt like our cell phones and our fancy watches and cameras had stopped us from dreaming 
it stopped us from being inspired 
so i jumped in i jumped into this world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it 
been illustrating books since i was sixteen 
so when i thought the ipad i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world 
good it good it could know how they're holding 
can it can know where we are 
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch 
storytelling is becoming more and more monkeys and theory 
what are we doing with it 
so i'm just going to go in and launch korea and interactive app for the ipad 
it says place your fingers upon each light and so the and so i type in my name 
actually become a character 
admitted coin a little later dropped down to me and the ipad know where you live because gps actually addressed to me 
with child and me really hated by these kind of both ability 
i've been talking a lot about magic 
i don't mean desert and dragons i mean the kind of childhood magic build ideas that we all have our children 
fireflies and a job for some reason with always really exciting to me 
over here you need to take the fireflies 
they actually illuminate your way through 
another idea that really touched me as a child with an entire galaxy could be contained within a single mother 
each book and each world become into a little model that i drag in this magical device within the debate 
it opens up a map 
another long often people have always had managed to these maps had been hidden 
and this is a map that grow oven gloves and become navigation for the rest of the world 
revealed itself at certain points in the book as well 
enter in 
and another thing that's actually really important to me it's creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary 
these are the appearance 
so we all heard about fed even we've all heard about names but how many people outside of india know about that indian counterparts the absurdity 
or should have been trapped in faith in droves chamber for thousands of years when an oil in my head 
bringing them back during cooking 
the environment 
i think a big problem has been in the last ten years is that children have been locked inside their rooms glued to their pcs they haven't been able to get out 
but now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology 
one of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on the squished where you need to go outside take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects 
when i was a child i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells 
kids don't do that anymore 
so in bringing back to childhood ritual you need to go out and in one chapter take a picture of a flower and then tag 
in another chapter you need to take a picture of a piece of bach and then tag that 
what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online 
a child in london puts up a picture for fox and says i saw a fox today a child in india says i thought monkey today and it creates a kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken 
in terms of in the possibilities of linking together magic the earth and technology there are multiple possibilities 
the next book we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your home 
at one point your screen is filled up with leaves 
and so you need to make the sound of wind blow them away and read the rest of the book 
hanging there are moving to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology and magic and technology can come come closer together 
harnessing energy from the sun than that 
bringing our children and closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of the story 
thank you 

how can i be in ten minutes about the bones of women over three generations about how the astonishing string of those bonds took hold in the life of a four year old girl huddled with her younger sister her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat and the china sea more than thirty years ago bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today 
it was not a finished story 
a jigsaw puzzle still being put together 
for me tell you about some of the pieces 
imagine the first piece a man burning his life work here the poet a playwright a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hook of his country's unity and freedom 
imagine him as the communists enter saigon confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste 
word for so long he friends now mocked him 
he retreated into silence 
guide broken by history 
my grandfather 
i never knew him in real life 
but our lives are much more than our memory 
and my grandmother never let me forget his life 
duty with not to allow it to have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that year history tried to crush us but we endured 
connect piece of the jigsaw either the boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea 
my mother my with eighteen when her father died already in an arranged marriage already with two small girls 
for her life had instilled itself into one task the escape of her family and a new life in australia 
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed 
so after four year saga that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel 
for the adult knew the risks 
greatest fear was of pirates rape and death 
unlike most adult on the boat my mother carried a small bottle of poison 
we were captured first my sister and i then she and my grandmother would drink 
my first memories from the boat the steady beat of the engine the bow dipping into each wave the vast and empty horizon 
i don't remember the pirates who came many times but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours 
but i do remember the light from the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died the journeys and too much for him and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men 
apple has never tasted the same 
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne 
the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together 
we settled in footscray a working class suburb his demographic is layers of immigrants 
unlike the settled middle class suburb whose existence i was oblivious though there was no sense of entitlement in footscray 
the smell from shop doors were from the rest of the world 
the snippets of halting english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common they were starting again 
my mother worked on farms then on a car assembly line working six days double shift 
somehow she found time to study english and gain i t qualifications we were poor organ donors who are allocated an extra tuition in english and mathematics with budgeted for regardless of what without which was usually new clothes they will always that can hand 
prepare the stocking for school each to hide the holes in the other 
school uniform down to the ankles because it had to last for six years 
they will read but searing chants of fly and the occasional graffiti asian go home go home to wear 
something different inside me 
with a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying i will bypass 
and my mother my sister and i flipped in the same bed 
my mother was exhausted each night but we told one another about our day and listen to the movements of my grandmother around the house 
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat 
my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her 
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business 
the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and inflexible and troubled children caught between two worlds 
grantham sponsors resort centers were established and lived in parallel worlds 
in one of the classic asian student relentless in the demands made on myself 
the other i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious tragically scarred by finding drug abuse and isolation 
with so many over the years will help 
would that work when i was the final year law student i was chosen as the young australian of the year 
bandwidth catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another and the edges didn't fit 
calmly anonymous footscray resident with now calmly refugee and social activist invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into conflict with whom she could never have imagined i didn't know the protocols i didn't know how to use the cutlery 
i didn't know how to talk about why 
i didn't know how to talk about anything 
i wanted to retreat to the routine and comfort of life in an unsung suburb a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost twenty years telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep the three of us still in the same bed 
i told my mother i couldn't do it 
she reminded me that i was now the same a she had been when we boarded the boat no had never been an option just do it she said and don't be what you're not 
so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised and the more candidly iceberg the more i was asked to speak 
people from all walks of life so many of them doing the thing they loved living on the frontiers of possibility 
even though i finished my degree i realized i could not fatal into a career in law 
it had to be another piece of the jigsaw 
i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider a recent arrival new on the scene and not just ok but something to be thankful for perhaps a gift from the boat 
because being an insider can flow easily mean collapsing the horizons can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province 
stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that the world does fall apart but not in the way that you fear 
possibility that would not have been allowed for outrageously encouraged 
with an energy there and implacable optimism a strange mixture of humility and daring 
so i followed my hunches 
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can't be done with an irresistible challenge 
for a year we were penniless 
at the end of each day i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared 
we worked well into each night 
most of our ideas were crazy but a few were brilliant and we broke through 
i made the decision to move to the u s after only one trip my hunches again three months later i had relocated and the adventure has continued 
before i close the let me tell you about my grandmother 
if she grew up at a time when confucianism with the social norm and the local mandarin with the person who mattered 
life hadn't changed for centuries 
her father died soon after she was born 
her mother raised her alone 
at seventeen she became the second life of a mandarin whose mother beat her 
with no support from her husband he caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won it can't be done was shown to be wrong 
taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died six hundred miles away in melbourne 
i looked through the showers green and foil standing on the other side 
i knew she had come to say goodbye 
my mother phoned minutes later 
a few days later we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and fat around her casket 
we told her story and assured her that we were still with her 
midnight the blank came and told us he had closed casket 
my mother after to feel her hand 
she often monk why is it that her hand is so womb and the rest of the so called because you have been holding it since this morning he said he would have not let it go 
continue in our family it runs through the women 
but given who we were and how life had shaped us we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have florida 
defeat would have come to easily 
and now i would like to have my own children and i wondered about the boat 
we could ever wish it on their own 
i am afraid of privilege of ease of entitlement 
can i give them a bow in their lives keeping bravely into each wave the unperturbed and steady beat the engine the vast horizon that guarantees nothing i don't know but if i could give it and still see them safely through i would 
applause 
mother here today 
kevin a lock on the trends manager youtube and i professionally watch youtube videos so we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters 
we all want to be stars celebrities singers comedians and when i was younger that seems so very very hard to do 
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our worlds culture 
if any one of you can be famous on the internet by next saturday 
but there are over forty eight hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute 
of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and get tons of use and becomes a cultural moment 
so how did that happen 
three things tastemakers communities of participation 



we're bear baskets posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park 
in two thousand and ten it was twenty three million times the charter what it looked like when it first became popular last summer 
but he didn't actually set out to make a viral video bear 
he just wanted to share a rainbow 
because that's what you do in your name is yosemite mountain bear and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact 
this video posted all the way back in january 
so what happened here jimmy kimmel actually jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that will eventually propel the video to be as popular as it had become 
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduces new and interesting things and bring them to a larger 
so you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope 
rebecca black's friday is one of the most popular videos of the year 
it's been seen nearly two hundred million times this year 
is a chart of what it looked like 
and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere 
so what happened on this day 
well it was a friday 
and if you're wondering about those other spikes those are also friday but what about this day this one particular friday 
well josh point zero picks it up a lot of blogs started writing about 
michael j nelson for mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter 
what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process 
so then this community formed of people who share this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it 
now there are ten thousand parodies of friday 
even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week unlike the one way entertainment of the twentieth century this community participation that's how we become a part of the phenomenon of either by spreading it or doing something new 

the cat is a looped animation with live music 
this just like that 
been viewed nearly fifty million times this year 
if you think that it's weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this has been huge four million times even cats were watching this video cats were watching other cats watch this video 
applause 
what's important here what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst the techie geeky internet culture 
there were remixes made an old timey version the men who went international the entire remixed communities sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joked something that we could all actually be a part of 
because we don't just enjoy now we participate 
who could have predicted any of this 
we could have predicted to double rainbow rebecca black or cat scripts could you have written that would have contained within it 
in a world where over two days of video uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things happen 
when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines and new york city i admit i wasn't very interested 
the claim the 
applause 
by being totally surprising and humorous casey nice that got his funny idea and point five million times 
this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively 
and so it all brings us to one big question 
what does it mean 
case 
filmmakers 
creative participating communities complete unexpectedness these characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience to find the popularity 
as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on 
one has to greenlight your idea 
we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture 
these are not characteristics of old media and they're barely true of the media have today but they will define the entertainment of the future 
thank you 

cyber attacks treble mass destruction tornado recession decay jews disaster 
so those are just a few the clips i collected over the last six months could have easily been in the last six days or the last six years 
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to 
very good reason for that 
if every second of every day our senses bring and way too much data that we can possibly process and our brains 
and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala 
amygdala is our early warning detector or danger detector 
shorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything the environment that might harm us 
so given a dozen new stories we will preferentially look at the negative news 
that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true 
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week twenty four hours a day it's no wonder that we're pessimistic 
no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse 
but perhaps that's not the case 
perhaps instead it's the distortions brought to us but what's really going on 
perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance now i'm not saying we don't have our set of problems climate crisis species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do 
as humans we are far better at seeing the problems wayne advance but ultimately we knock them down 
so let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going 
over the last hundred years the average human lifespan has more than doubled average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled 
childhood mortality has come down a factor of ten 
add to that the cost of food electricity transportation communication have dropped ten two thousand 
fold steve pinker has showed us that in fact we're living during the most peaceful time ever in humans 
and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from twenty five percent over eighty percent in the last one hundred and thirty years 
we truly are living in an extraordinary time 
many people forget this 
we keep setting our expectations higher and higher 
in fact we redefine what poverty means 
in america today the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones air conditioning and cars 
the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperor's on this planet could never dreamed of such luxuries 
underpinning much of this is technology and of late exponentially growing technologies 
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve on moore's law and experiences price performance doubling every twelve to twenty four months 
why the cell phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper in one thousand times fashion a supercomputer of the seventies 
look at this curve 
is moore's law over the last hundred years 
when you're noticed two things from this curve 
number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time wartime and peacetime recession depression and boom time 
the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers 
it doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges 
also even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left it's curving upwards 
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster 
on this curve riding on moore's law or a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us 
cloud computing what my friends with autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics three d printing which the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet synthetic biology fuels vaccines and foods digital medicine nanomaterials and ai how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson 
that was epic in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could 
and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents jeopardy is not an easy game 
about the nuance of human language 
imagine if you would a i like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell phone 
four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university and we teach our students all of these technologies in particular how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges 
every year we ask them to start a company or product or a service that can affect positively lives of a billion people within a decade 
think about the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today 
for thirty years ago i would have sounded ludicrous 
you can point at dozens of companies that have done just that when i think about 
when i think about creating abundance it's not about creating a life of luxury for business planet it's about creating a life of possibility 
it 's about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant 
we see scarcity is contextual and technology is a resource liberating force 
let me give you an example 
so this is a story of napoleon the third in the mid one thousand eight hundred he's the dude on the left 
he invited over to dinner the king of siam 
napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils napoleon himself with gold utensils 
but the king of siam he was fed with aluminum utensils 
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet worth more than gold and platinum 
the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum 
even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass it doesn't come to the pure metal 
all bound by oxygen and silly 
within a technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality 
flex project this analogy going forward 
we think about energy scarcity 
ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use 
a year sixteen terawatts of energy hit the earth's surface every eighty eight 
five minutes it's not about being scarce it's about 
there is good news here 
for the first time this year the cost of solar generated electricity is fifty percent that of diesel generated electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees 
the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year 
last month mit put out a study showing up at the end of this decade and the funny part is the united states solar electricity six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents at the national average 
and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water not we talked about water wars 
do you remember when carl sagan turn the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth in one thousand nine hundred and the effort just passed saturn 
he took a famous photo 
was called a pale blue dot because we live on a water planet 
we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water 
ninety seven point five percent and saltwater two percent of ice and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet but here too there is hope 
there 's technology coming online not can twenty years from now right now 
nanotechnology coming on 
and the conversation i had with being came in this morning when the great diy innovators i'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of its the size of a small dorm room refrigerator 
but able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine at less than two cents a liter 
the chairman of coca cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world 
if that pans out which have every confidence it will coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet 
this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exist today 
and we've seen this in cell phones 
my goodness we're going to hit seventy percent penetration of cell phones in the developing world by the end of two thousand and thirteen 
think about it that a mass i warrior on a cell phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile common president reagan did twenty five years ago 
if they're on a smartphone on google they've got access to more knowledge information president clinton did fifteen years ago 
living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could ever predicted 
better than that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for gps hd video and still images libraries of books and music medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing and d monetizing into your cell phone 
probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health 
last month i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the ten million dollar qualcomm tricorder x 
prize were challenging teams around the world to basically combined these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to could have gotten ai you can cough on it you can do a finger blood 
when he fell to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors 
so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden one point three percent of the health care workers 
when this device sequences and rna or dna virus and it doesn't recognize it cause the cdc prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place 
but here here is the biggest force for bringing about world of abundance 
i call it the rising billion 
so the white lines here are population 
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth 
and by the way the biggest protection against the population explosion is making the world educated and healthy 
two thousand and ten we had just short of two billion people online connected 
by two thousand and twenty that's going from two billion to five billion internet users 
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation 
what will these people want 
they consume 
if only desire 
rather than having economic shutdown weren't about to have the biggest economic injection ever 
people represent can have trillions of dollars injected into the global economy 
they will get healthier by using a try quarter and it will become better educated by using the khan academy and by literally being able to use three d printing and an infinite computing more productive than ever before 
so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us 
how about a set of voices have never been heard from before 
what about giving the oppressed wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever 
what do these three billion people bring 
what about contributions we can't even predict 
one thing i've learned that the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past 
so let me share and close with a story that really got me excited 
there is a program that familiar you might have heard 
game called 
it came out of the university of washington in seattle 
this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acid and figure out how the protein is going to fold 
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality 
it 's very important for research and medicine 
up until now it's been a supercomputer problem 
this game has been played by university professors and so forth 
and it's literally hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing 
and it showed that in fact today the human pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins in the best computers 
when these individuals went and looked at who is the best protein folder in the world it wasn't an mit professor wasn't at caltech student with a person from england from manchester a woman who during the day was an executive assistant into rehab clinic and at night with the world's best protein folder 
ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered individuals to take on the grand challenges on this planet 
we have the tools with this exponential technology 
we have the passion of the diy innovator 
we have the capital of the of the techno philanthropist 
we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do 
we are living into an extraordinary decades ahead 
thank you
