ted_1096_0012610_0016680 back in new york i am the head of development for a nonprofit called robin hood 
ted_1096_0016900_0022040 when i'm not fighting poverty i'm fighting fires as the assistant captain would volunteer fire company 
ted_1096_0022530_0030630 in our town where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff you have to get to the fire seem pretty early to get in on any action 
ted_1096_0031520_0033070 i remember my first fire 
ted_1096_0033340_0037490 it was the second volunteer on the scene so there was a pretty good chance i was going to get 
ted_1096_0038480_0044050 still it was a real foot race against the other volunteers get to the cap and in charge to find out what our assignments would be 
ted_1096_0044910_0053510 down the captain he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner who was surely having one of the worst days of her life 
ted_1096_0054200_0063790 it was the middle of the night she was standing outside in the pouring rain under an umbrella in her pajamas barefoot while her house was in flames 
ted_1096_0065150_0083490 the other volunteer who had arrived just before me let's call him lex luther got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog jog i was stunned with jealousy 
ted_1096_0083680_0094050 here are some lawyer money manager who for the rest of his life gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature just because he beat me by five seconds 
ted_1096_0094150_0096190 well i was next 
ted_1096_0096810_0098210 captain waved me over 
ted_1096_0098580_0110670 bezos i need you to go into the house i need you to go upstairs past the fire and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes as well 
ted_1096_0112120_0126120 so not exactly what i was hoping for but off i went up the stairs down the hall pass the real firefighters who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes 
ted_1096_0126140_0142550 i know what you're thinking but i'm no hero i carried my payload back downstairs where i met my nemesis in the precious dog by the front door 
ted_1096_0143860_0151270 we took our treasures outside to the homeowner were not surprisingly his received much more attention than did mine 
ted_1096_0152230_0158260 a few weeks later the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed and saving her home 
ted_1096_0159150_0165070 the act of kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes 
ted_1096_0166725_0166925 
ted_1096_0167020_0180320 both my vocation and robin hood in my application is volunteer firefighter i am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale but i'm also witnessed the acts of grace and courage on an individual basis 
ted_1096_0181060_0195260 what i've learned they all matter so as i look around this room at people who either have achieved or are on their way to achieving remarkable levels of success i would offer this reminder don't wait 
ted_1096_0197020_0200060 one way to make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life 
ted_1096_0200340_0203140 if you have something to give give it now 
ted_1096_0204200_0208500 food a soup kitchen clean up a neighborhood park be a mentor 
ted_1096_0209340_0216380 every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody's life but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one 
ted_1096_0216900_0219310 so get in the game save the shoes 
ted_1096_0219880_0228600 thank you 
ted_1096_0228525_0228725 
ted_1096_0228650_0234020 
ted_1096_0235700_0235900 applause 
ted_1102_0012780_0016900 i just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival 
ted_1102_0018390_0027820 it 's a place where women run the show have sex to say hello and play rules the day were fun is serious business 
ted_1102_0028360_0036790 no this is burning man or san francisco ladies and gentlemen major costume 
ted_1102_0037520_0041210 it is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo 
ted_1102_0042130_0047960 bonobos are together with chimpanzees you're living closest relative 
ted_1102_0048640_0055620 means we all share a common ancestor an evolutionary grandmother who lived around six million years ago 
ted_1102_0057210_0061200 now chimpanzees are well known for their aggression 
ted_1102_0065055_0065255 applause 
ted_1102_0065180_0071940 but unfortunately we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in a narrative of human evolution 
ted_1102_0073580_0076780 but bonobos show us the other side of the coin 
ted_1102_0077850_0086580 with chimpanzees are dominated by big scary guy bonobo society is run by empowered females 
ted_1102_0088320_0098180 guys are really worked something out and lead to a highly tolerant society were fatal violence has not been observed yet 
ted_1102_0100020_0104400 but unfortunately bonobos are the least understood of the great apes 
ted_1102_0105220_0111320 believe in the depth of the congolese jungle and it has been very difficult to study them 
ted_1102_0111880_0131700 congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war 
ted_1102_0133580_0138940 and not surprisingly this destruction also endangers bonobo survival 
ted_1102_0139750_0150090 bushmeat trade and forest loss means we couldn't fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world and we're not even sure that to be honest 
ted_1102_0151500_0159640 yet in this land of violence and chaos you can hear hidden laughter swaying the tree 
ted_1102_0160270_0174690 who are the guardians we know them as they make love not war apes they have frequent promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and soul social issues 
ted_1102_0175100_0184440 now i'm not saying this is the solution to all of humanity's problems there's more to life than the kama sutra 
ted_1102_0185500_0189000 bonobos like humans love to play throughout their entire life 
ted_1102_0189570_0191530 plane not just child's game 
ted_1102_0192030_0197510 for us and them play foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerant 
ted_1102_0198230_0202140 were willing to try and where we learn about the rules of the game 
ted_1102_0203580_0217060 play in p g and resilience and it's all about the generation of diversity diversity of interactions diversity of behaviors diversity of connections 
ted_1102_0218780_0226570 when you watch banal clay you're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human lactic down and rachel 
ted_1102_0227770_0230520 play is the glue that binds us together 
ted_1102_0231860_0238510 now i don't know how you play but i want to show you a couple of unique clip fresh from the wild 
ted_1102_0238910_0250140 first it's a ballgame bonobo style and i do not mean football so here we have a young female and male engaged in a chess game 
ted_1102_0250970_0252330 look what she's doing 
ted_1102_0253150_0263090 in my view their evolutionary origin of the phrase she's got him by the wolf only that i think is rather loving it here right 
ted_1102_0264900_0271590 perfect play is common in both bonobos a human 
ted_1102_0272750_0294030 the heat is really interesting because it shows the village really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play such as testicles and and joseph howe play both require extra and fosters trust while at the same time being tremendous fun 
ted_1102_0294830_0310340 but play for shapeshifter could play for shapeshifter and it can take many forms and some of some of which are more quiet imaginative curious maybe we're wonder is discovered a new 
ted_1102_0310900_0315990 i want you to see this in folklore young female and she's quietly playing with water 
ted_1102_0317070_0323840 like her we sometimes play alone and we explore the boundaries of our inner and are our world 
ted_1102_0325320_0336690 he slept playful curiosity that drugs to explode dreyfus to encourage and then the unexpected connections will form the real hotbed for creativity 
ted_1102_0338330_0345180 so these are just mulcahy this into the insights that bonobo give us to our past the present 
ted_1102_0345970_0362800 but they also hold a secret for a future a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation the secret is that play in the key to its capacity 
ted_1102_0363530_0366800 the word play their adoptive wildcard 
ted_1102_0367720_0372580 in order to adapt successfully to a changing world we need to play 
ted_1102_0375160_0378370 but really make the most of her playfulness 
ted_1102_0378880_0387380 play is not frivolous plus pancho for bonobos and humans alike life not just red in tooth and claw 
ted_1102_0388270_0394040 in times when it seemed least appropriate to play in my view the times when his most urgent 
ted_1102_0395240_0408700 so my fellow primates little embrace this gift or evolution and play together as we rediscover creativity fellowship and wonder 
ted_1102_0408860_0409330 it thank you 
ted_1102_0412925_0413125 
ted_1104_0012850_0028840 to imagine a wearable robot gives you superhuman abilities or another one that takes wheelchair users standing and walking again 
ted_1104_0030550_0034870 for me at berkeley bionics call these robots 
ted_1104_0035720_0053040 these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning and it will give you extra strain and we will further enhance your speed and will help you for instance to manage your balance 
ted_1104_0053880_0059250 actually that through integration of the man and the machine 
ted_1104_0059940_0067080 but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there 
ted_1104_0067770_0069880 it 's just not on blue sky thinking 
ted_1104_0070140_0083930 to show you know what we're working on by starting out talking about the american soldier up an average does carry about one hundred pounds on their backs and they are being asked to carry more equipment 
ted_1104_0084930_0095130 obviously this is research thing into a major complications back injuries thirty percent of them chronic back injuries 
ted_1104_0095530_0104410 so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue 
ted_1104_0105620_0113220 so let me now introduced you have or the human universal load carrier 
ted_1104_0115090_0119780 over very terrain for many hours 
ted_1104_0120160_0125280 flexible design allows for deep squats crawl and high agility movement 
ted_1104_0125820_0130720 it senses what i want to do wear on a go and then augments my strength and endurance 
ted_1104_0134180_0141480 we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device is new exoskeleton this year 
ted_1104_0142120_0143010 so this for real 
ted_1104_0144240_0152150 now let's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users something that i'm particularly passionate about 
ted_1104_0153380_0157990 sixty eight million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide 
ted_1104_0158550_0161690 this is about one percent of the total population 
ted_1104_0161760_0163900 and that's actually a conservative estimate 
ted_1104_0164440_0176460 we are talking here about oftentimes very young individuals with spinal cord injuries that in the prime of the light twenties or thirties forties hit the wall and divinity is the only option 
ted_1104_0176740_0180460 but there's also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers 
ted_1104_0181080_0188700 and the only option pretty much stroke or other complications is the wheelchair 
ted_1104_0188700_0195060 that is actually for the last five hundred years since it's very successful introduction i must say 
ted_1104_0196880_0202880 so we thought he would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility 
ted_1104_0204520_0221610 so let me introduce you to elect that is worn by amanda boxtel that nineteen years ago a spinal cord injured and as a result of that he has not been able to walk for nineteen years until now 
ted_1104_0221535_0221735 applause 
ted_1104_0232430_0235240 samantha 
ted_1104_0235440_0248690 powered electric said that has sensors it's completely noninvasive sensors in a crisis that sends signals back to our on board computer that is sitting here after back 
ted_1104_0249480_0262410 battery pack here as well that power motors that are sitting at their hips as well as a knee joints that move forward in this kind of smooth and a very natural gate 
ted_1104_0265020_0274090 i was twenty four years old and at the top of my game when a freak somersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me 
ted_1104_0274730_0281180 in a split second i lost all can station and movement below my pelvis 
ted_1104_0282390_0296000 not long after a doctor strode into my hospital room and he said amanda you'll never walk again and that was nineteen years ago 
ted_1104_0297000_0301480 key rubbed every ounce of hope from my being 
ted_1104_0302470_0310440 adaptive technology has enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again to rock climb and even handed cycle 
ted_1104_0310650_0319070 but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk until now 
ted_1104_0327455_0327655 applause 
ted_1104_0327545_0327745 applause 
ted_1104_0332940_0340820 so you can see we have the technology we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you 
ted_1104_0342050_0360000 in our hands and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations not only for the soldiers or or amanda here and all the wheelchair users but for everyone 
ted_1104_0362460_0362670 
ted_1104_0362595_0362795 
ted_1114_0012750_0021920 have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous 
ted_1114_0022430_0026270 i went to prison difficult 
ted_1114_0027480_0030940 i worked in a coal mine dangerous 
ted_1114_0032250_0035630 i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous 
ted_1114_0036770_0045360 and i spent thirty days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning little difficult in the middle very dangerous in the end 
ted_1114_0047080_0064800 in fact most of my career i have been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations where the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging that make them interesting that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience 
ted_1114_0065230_0072100 so when i knew i was coming here through a tedtalk there was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship i knew i would want to do something a little different 
ted_1114_0072690_0077540 some of you may or may not have heard a couple of weeks ago i took out an ad on ebay 
ted_1114_0078660_0111220 i sent out some facebook messages some twitter messages and i gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my two thousand and eleven tedtalk that's right some lucky individual corporation for profit or nonprofit was going to get the once in a lifetime opportunity because i'm sure chris anderson will never let it happen again to buy the naming rights the talk you're watching right now that at the time didn't have a title didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really get much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be 
ted_1114_0112240_0150790 so what you were getting was this your name here presents my tedtalk that you have no idea what the subject isn't depending on the continent could ultimately blow up in your face especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it but that being said it's a very good media opportunity you know how many people watch these ted talks a lot that's just the working title by the way so even with that caveat i knew that someone would buy the naming rights 
ted_1114_0150790_0153960 and he would have asked me about a year ago i wouldn't have been able to tell you that with any certainty 
ted_1114_0154480_0158640 but the new project that i'm working on my new film we examined the world of marketing advertising 
ted_1114_0159970_0181730 and as i said earlier i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years but nothing could prepare me nothing could read me for anything as difficult orange dangerous and it's going into the rooms with these guys you see i had this idea for a movie 
ted_1114_0181740_0190710 what i want to do is make a film all about product placement marketing and advertising or the entire film is funded by product placement marketing and advertising 
ted_1114_0191350_0212060 so the movie will be called the greatest movie ever sold so what happens in the greatest movie ever sold is that everything from top to bottom from start to finish is branded from beginning to end from the above the title sponsor you'll see in the movie which is brand x now this brand me qualcomm stadium the staples center these people will be married to the film interpreter forever 
ted_1114_0212360_0220530 the film explores and certainly on its way through improper that was more 
ted_1114_0221630_0222100 period 
ted_1114_0222330_0227720 for every but not only we're going to have the brand x title sponsor but we're going to make sure we sell out every category and canada film 
ted_1114_0227830_0236420 so maybe we sell issue and it becomes the greatest show you ever wore the greatest car you ever director from the greatest movie ever sold the the greatest drink you've ever had courtesy of the greatest movie ever sold 
ted_1114_0236460_0243160 so the idea is beyond just showing that brains are probably like could actually get them to finance the film has identified in the film 
ted_1114_0243170_0245300 actually we show the whole process of how does it work 
ted_1114_0245310_0247220 the goal of this whole film is transparency 
ted_1114_0247420_0249670 we 're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie 
ted_1114_0249770_0253270 the whole concept the whole film start to finish 
ted_1114_0253550_0255510 i would love for sanjay to help make it happen 
ted_1114_0255710_0263090 it's funny because when i first here it is the ultimate respect for an audience 
ted_1114_0263100_0267410 i don't know how receptive people are going to be to it 
ted_1114_0267610_0274540 perspective or dear i don't want to use angle because they serve as a negative thing but i know how this is going to play out 
ted_1114_0274870_0277150 i wanted to do 
ted_1114_0277920_0279600 one point five million with it 
ted_1114_0280020_0287550 i think that you're going to have a hard time meeting with him but i think it's certainly worth pursuing a couple of really big brands 
ted_1114_0287560_0291840 who knows maybe by the time or film comes out we look like a bunch of blithering idiots 
ted_1114_0291850_0293820 what do you think the responses 
ted_1114_0294120_0296440 the responses mostly will be no 
ted_1114_0296940_0299190 whichever so because the film or sell because of me 
ted_1114_0300410_0301130 both 
ted_1114_0301360_0307740 not so optimistic so can you help me an email 
ted_1114_0308290_0308760 
ted_1114_0309110_0312520 that gets us 
ted_1114_0313420_0314990 we 've got to figure out which brands 
ted_1114_0315000_0320090 yeah that's ducks challenge when you when you look like when people are going to deal with 
ted_1114_0320090_0324890 we got some places we can go up to turn the camera 
ted_1114_0324890_0331710 turn the camera augment let's have an off the record conversation turns out it really means we want nothing to do with your mood 
ted_1114_0332100_0338990 and just like that one by one all of these companies suddenly disappeared 
ted_1114_0339720_0344970 and none of them wanted anything to do with this movie i mean i was amazed they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project 
ted_1114_0344970_0365440 i was blown away because i thought the whole concept the idea of advertising was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible to get as many people to see it as plausible especially in today's world is this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape isn't the idea to get that new buzzworthy delivery vehicle that's going to get that message to the masses 
ted_1114_0366460_0367400 that 's what i thought 
ted_1114_0367950_0376480 but the problem was you see my idea had one fatal flaw and that flaw was this 
ted_1114_0377940_0379480 that was not the flaw whatsoever 
ted_1114_0379480_0383140 it would have been a problem at all see this would have been fine 
ted_1114_0383140_0385230 what this image represents was the problem 
ted_1114_0385250_0396370 when you do a google image search for transparency this is this is one of the first images that comes up 
ted_1114_0396650_0399650 so i liked the way you roll sergey brin 
ted_1114_0399830_0421310 this this was the problem transparency free from pretense or deceit easily detected are seen through readily understood characterized by visibility or accessibility of information especially concerning business practices that last line being probably the biggest problem 
ted_1114_0421730_0423780 we hear a lot about transparency these days 
ted_1114_0423870_0428570 if our politicians say it our president says it even our ceos say it 
ted_1114_0429030_0450900 suddenly when it comes down to it becoming a reality something suddenly changes but why well transparency is scary like that odd still screaming bear it's unpredictable like this odd country road 
ted_1114_0450900_0460730 and it's also very risky what else is what else is risky 
ted_1114_0460810_0470160 feeding an entire bowl of cool with very risky 
ted_1114_0472080_0478780 when i started talking to companies telling them that we wanted to tell the story and they said no we want you to tell a story 
ted_1114_0479020_0504110 we want you to tell a story really want to tell our story she when i was a kid my father would catch me in some sort of ally myriad giving me the lucky often gave me he would say sun there's three sides to every story there's your story there's my story and there's the real story you see what this film we wanted to tell the real story 
ted_1114_0504110_0517530 but with only one company one agency willing to help me and that's only because i knew jon bon and richard kirshenbaum for years i realized that i would have to go on my own and have to cut out the middleman and go to the company's myself you know myself with all of my team

ted_1114_0731325_0731525 applause 
ted_1114_0731450_0741550 but i realized i needed an expert i need somebody who could get inside my head somebody who could really helped me understand what they call your brand personality and so i found a company called olson zaltman in pittsburgh 
ted_1114_0741840_0746540 it helps companies like nationally for breeze hallmark discover that brand personality 
ted_1114_0746550_0748850 they could do it for them surely they could do it for me

ted_1114_0770650_0775250 and all those things stemmed and started from one place and for me the stem and started with my family in west virginia 
ted_1114_0775270_0776100 the next 
ted_1114_0776100_0779160 in fact that the next one this is the best day

ted_1114_0780390_0789890 concerned about having lived like who do i want to be like things that are different things that are weird turning up a wife who wouldn't that different 
ted_1114_0789950_0792070 the machete pupa stage genuine 
ted_1114_0792310_0792650 important 
ted_1114_0793020_0794340 wood 
ted_1114_0794810_0796720 
ted_1114_0796730_0797830 
ted_1114_0799490_0800800 mother 
ted_1114_0800970_0801650 
ted_1114_0801690_0801930 applause 
ted_1114_0801930_0805260 thank you may think 
ted_1114_0805790_0806760 patient 
ted_1114_0806760_0811430 things will come to this 
ted_1114_0812000_0813760 there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there 
ted_1114_0814280_0824420 the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct but complimentary size to your brand personality the morgan spurlock brand as a mindful play brand 
ted_1114_0824650_0827070 a kind of juxtapose very nicely together 
ted_1114_0827070_0828820 and i think there's almost a paradox width 
ted_1114_0828830_0835260 and i think some companies will just focus on one one of their strengths or or the other instead of focusing on 
ted_1114_0835280_0846810 most companies tend to and human nature to avoid things that are not sure avoid fear those elements and you really embrace those and you actually turn them into positives forehands and it's anything to say 
ted_1114_0846830_0848080 what other brands are like that 
ted_1114_0848560_0850570 for the first time here is a classic apple 
ted_1114_0850950_0857060 and you can see here to target we many mini coopers and jetblue 
ted_1114_0857120_0864110 playful brands in mind for brands those sort of things that have come and gone but a playful mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing 
ted_1114_0864530_0866060 playful michael brand 
ted_1114_0866060_0866770 what is your brand 
ted_1114_0866770_0870440 if somebody actually describe your brand identity your brand personality what would you be 
ted_1114_0870770_0874530 are you end up attribute or you something that gets the blood flowing 
ted_1114_0874900_0876280 are you more of a down attribute 
ted_1114_0876280_0879370 something a little more calm reserved conservative 
ted_1114_0879750_0893860 attributes are things like being playful being fresh like the fresh prince contemporary adventurous edgy are daring like errol flynn nimble or agile profane domineering magical mystical like gandalf 
ted_1114_0894620_0896090 are you more down attributes 
ted_1114_0896450_0898680 mindful sophisticated w seven 
ted_1114_0898680_0903300 established traditional nurturing protective empathetic like the oprah 
ted_1114_0903770_0911850 reliable stable familiar safe secure sacred contemplated or wind like the dalai lama or yoda 
ted_1114_0912770_0925360 over the course this film we had five hundred plus companies who were up and down companies say no they didn't want any part of this project they wanted nothing to do with this film mainly because they had no control they would have no control over the final product 
ted_1114_0925360_0941930 we did get seventeen brand partners who are willing to relinquish control who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and its playful as myself and he will ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally wouldn't be able to tell stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind 
ted_1114_0942670_0954220 enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they're using mri to target the desire synergy of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing 
ted_1114_0954840_0957570 we went to st paul or where they have banned outdoor advertising 
ted_1114_0957570_0970230 in the entire city for the past five years there's no billboards is no posters there's no fliers nothing and we went to school districts were now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across america 
ted_1114_0972150_0978470 what 's incredible for me is the projects that i've gotten the most feedback out of her i've had the most success in or ones where i've interacted with things directly 
ted_1114_0978470_0979830 and that's what these brands did 
ted_1114_0980080_0985520 cut out the middleman they cut out their agencies and said maybe these agencies don't have my best interests in mind 
ted_1114_0985880_0987730 i'm going to deal directly with the artist 
ted_1114_0987940_0993220 i'm going to work with him to create something different something is going to get people thinking that's going to challenge the way we look at the world 
ted_1114_0993700_0999060 how has that been for them has been successful well since the film premiered at the sundance film festival is just take a look 
ted_1114_0999360_1007020 according to burrelles the movie premiered in january and since then and this is a name in the whole thing we've had more than nine hundred million media impressions for this film 
ted_1114_1007320_1009330 little covering just like a two and a half week period 
ted_1114_1009400_1011760 it 's only online no print no tv 
ted_1114_1011980_1013470 the film has been distributed 
ted_1114_1013470_1014510 it's not even online 
ted_1114_1014510_1017900 not even streaming it's not even been out and do other foreign countries yet 
ted_1114_1018480_1022890 ultimately this little has already started to gain a lot of momentum 
ted_1114_1023200_1028240 not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talk to advise their clients not to take part 
ted_1114_1029160_1034830 what i always believed that if you take chances if you take risks that in those risks will come opportunity 
ted_1114_1035220_1039220 i believe that when you push people away from that you're pushing them more towards failure 
ted_1114_1039980_1046320 i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse then you're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged 
ted_1114_1047050_1051600 i feel like that what has to happen moving forward as we need to encourage people to take risks 
ted_1114_1051940_1055410 we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them 
ted_1114_1055790_1058760 ultimately moving forward i think we have to embrace sphere 
ted_1114_1059260_1074590 we've got to put that bear in a cage embrace fear embrace risk one big spoonful at a time we have to embrace risk 
ted_1114_1074590_1077400 and ultimately we have to embrace transparency 
ted_1114_1079190_1082910 today more than ever a little honesty is going to go a long way 
ted_1114_1082910_1112820 and that being said through honesty and transparency my entire talk embrace transparency has been brought to you by my good friend that he and see hooper seven thousand one hundred dollars bought the naming rights on ebay she turning big data into a big opportunity for organizations all over 
ted_1114_1112820_1114910 world mc presents 
ted_1114_1115210_1117030 embrace transparency thank you very 
ted_1114_1131415_1131615 applause 
ted_1114_1131540_1138050 what exactly happened to that 
ted_1114_1138050_1139450 seventy one hundred and that is 
ted_1114_1141470_1152420 i have in my pocket a chick made out to the parent organization of the ted foundation the sapling foundation a check for seven thousand one hundred dollars to be applied towards my attendance for next 
ted_1114_1152415_1152615 serious 
ted_1114_1152610_1164670 
ted_1378_0012730_0015890 the really extraordinary honor for me 
ted_1378_0015920_0026380 i spend most of my time in jails and prisons on death row i spend most of my time and very low income communities and the projects in places where there's a great deal of hopelessness 
ted_1378_0026930_0032410 being here at ted and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me 
ted_1378_0032410_0036930 one of the things that's emerged when my short time here is that ted has an identity 
ted_1378_0037870_0042430 and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world 
ted_1378_0042430_0048750 and sometimes when it comes through ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it does 
ted_1378_0049460_0052240 i mention that because i think identity is really important 
ted_1378_0052780_0055340 we 've had some fantastic presentations 
ted_1378_0055720_0062960 i think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful 
ted_1378_0063570_0068020 if you're a doctor you can do some good things with your carrying doctor you can do some other things 
ted_1378_0068620_0071090 i want to talk about the power of identity 
ted_1378_0071960_0075780 i didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do 
ted_1378_0075780_0078290 i actually learn about this from my grandmother 
ted_1378_0078340_0086310 i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother 
ted_1378_0086980_0090390 if she was tough she was strong she was powerful 
ted_1378_0091250_0097880 if she was the end of every argument and our family she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family 
ted_1378_0098660_0101030 if she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved 
ted_1378_0101390_0104350 her parents were born into slavery in virginia and the 
ted_1378_0104350_0109710 if she was born in the eighteen eighties and experience the slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world 
ted_1378_0110880_0112930 and my grandmother was tough but she was also loving 
ted_1378_0112940_0115860 when i would see it as a little boy should come up to me and she'd give me these hugs 
ted_1378_0115860_0120220 when she squeezed me so tight i could barely breathe and then she'd let me go 
ted_1378_0121020_0129870 in an hour or two later if i saw her she'd come over to me to brian do you still feel me hugging you and if i said no she'd assault me again and i'd say yes she'd leave me alone 
ted_1378_0129920_0133010 she just had this quality you always wanted to be near her 
ted_1378_0133740_0136220 the only challenge was that she had ten children 
ted_1378_0136220_0138060 my mom was the youngest of her ten kids 
ted_1378_0138060_0142420 and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her would be difficult to get her time and attention 
ted_1378_0142430_0144230 my cousins would be running around everywhere 
ted_1378_0144230_0151120 i remember when i was about eight or nine years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around 
ted_1378_0151530_0154740 my grandmother was seeing across the room staring at me 
ted_1378_0155540_0157550 at first i thought we were playing again 
ted_1378_0158320_0160910 and i would look at her and i smile but she was very serious 
ted_1378_0161720_0168940 after about fifteen or twenty minutes she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on brain 
ted_1378_0168940_0173760 we 're not going to have a talk and i remember this just like it happened yesterday 
ted_1378_0174610_0202040 and never will forget it she took me out back and she said brian on will tell you something but you don't tell anybody what i tell you i said okay mama she said you make sure you don't do that i said sure that she sat me down and she looked at me and she said i want you to know i've been watching you and she said i think your special she said i think you can do anything you want to do i will never forget 
ted_1378_0203550_0217800 then she said i just need you to promise me three things right i said okay mama she said the first thing i want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby grown to promise me now you'll always take care for well i adored my mom's i said yes 
ted_1378_0217800_0228910 do that she said the second thing i want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing i thought about it and i said yes ma'am 
ted_1378_0228920_0239460 do that then found she said the third thing i want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol while i was nine years old and i said yes 
ted_1378_0239460_0240200 do that 
ted_1378_0240840_0245150 i grew up in the country in the rural south and have a brother your older than me in a secure your younger 
ted_1378_0245170_0253470 when i was about fourteen or fifteen one day my brother came home and he had a six pack of beer i don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister we went out in the woods 
ted_1378_0253470_0256390 we were kind of just out there doing stuff with crazily dead 
ted_1378_0256390_0263670 he had a sip of despair and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me i said no no no no that's okay yoga 
ted_1378_0263670_0267420 i'm not going to have any beer my brothers to come on we're doing this today you always do what we do 
ted_1378_0267450_0268670 i had some your sister had 
ted_1378_0268670_0271260 some beer said no i don't feel right about that 
ted_1378_0271260_0275090 and although ahead y'all go ahead and my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you 
ted_1378_0275350_0294390 for beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh i hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mom ahead with you i said well what are you talking about his little monique held all the grandkids at their special i was devastated 
ted_1378_0294325_0294525 
ted_1378_0297280_0300180 i'm going to admit something to you i'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn't 
ted_1378_0300180_0302200 this might be broadcast broadly 
ted_1378_0302200_0317410 but i'm i'm fifty two years old and i'm going to admit to you that i've never had a drop of alcohol i don't i don't say that because i think that's virtuous i say that because there is power in identity 
ted_1378_0318260_0324900 when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe makes sense 
ted_1378_0324910_0328380 we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do 
ted_1378_0329070_0332570 when i thought about my grandmother can't of course you would think all her grandkids were special 
ted_1378_0332830_0335000 my grandfather was imprisoned during prohibition 
ted_1378_0335030_0337470 by male uncles died of alcohol related diseases 
ted_1378_0337690_0340180 these were the things she thought we needed to commit to 
ted_1378_0341130_0343770 well i've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system 
ted_1378_0344640_0348250 this country is very different today than it was forty years ago 
ted_1378_0348310_0351260 nine hundred and seventy two there were three hundred thousand people in jail 
ted_1378_0351380_0354380 prisons today there are two point three 
ted_1378_0356620_0360190 in the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world 
ted_1378_0360480_0363410 we have seven million people on probation and parole 
ted_1378_0363440_0368700 mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world 
ted_1378_0370180_0377570 in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that has been shaped by these outcomes 
ted_1378_0378110_0384300 one out of three black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty is in jail in prison on probation or parole 
ted_1378_0385430_0395450 in urban communities across this country los angeles philadelphia baltimore washington fifty to sixty percent of our young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole 
ted_1378_0395980_0401790 system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race there are also distorted by poverty 
ted_1378_0401790_0409800 we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty then if you're poor innocent 
ted_1378_0409900_0413580 well not culpability shapes outcomes 
ted_1378_0414690_0417360 yet we seem to be very comfortable 
ted_1378_0418420_0425570 the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected 
ted_1378_0427070_0430520 interesting to me were looking at some very interesting developments in our work 
ted_1378_0430700_0436670 by state of alabama like a number of states actually permanently disenfranchised as you if you have a criminal conviction 
ted_1378_0436670_0442780 right now in alabama thirty four percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote 
ted_1378_0443390_0450610 were actually projecting and another ten years and level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the voting rights act 
ted_1378_0450650_0453060 there 's this stunning silence 
ted_1378_0455090_0458470 i represent children a lot of my clients were very young 
ted_1378_0458480_0463780 the united states is the only country in the world where we sentence thirteen year old children to die in prison 
ted_1378_0464550_0467320 we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country 
ted_1378_0468020_0469650 and we're actually doing some litigation 
ted_1378_0470050_0471200 country in the world 
ted_1378_0472120_0473490 aboriginal people on death row 
ted_1378_0473500_0475520 what's interesting this question of the death penalty 
ted_1378_0476510_0482560 in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they committed 
ted_1378_0482590_0484420 and that's a very sensible question 
ted_1378_0485130_0488190 but there's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity 
ted_1378_0488830_0496610 another way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill fascinating 
ted_1378_0496610_0498880 death penalty in america is defined by error 
ted_1378_0499480_0506450 for every nine people who have been executed with actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death row 
ted_1378_0507510_0512060 kind of astonishing error rate one out of nine people innocent 
ted_1378_0512880_0513720 it 's fascinating 
ted_1378_0513720_0520190 in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes for every nine plant it took off one would crash 
ted_1378_0521100_0524350 but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem 
ted_1378_0524970_0526110 it 's not our problem 
ted_1378_0526590_0527720 not our burden 
ted_1378_0527950_0529090 not our struggle 
ted_1378_0530480_0531940 talk a lot about these issues 
ted_1378_0531940_0536010 talk about a ration this question whether we deserve to kill 
ted_1378_0536010_0540570 and it's interesting when i teach my students but african american history i tell them about slavery 
ted_1378_0540940_0546310 tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war 
ted_1378_0546520_0547940 we don't really know very much about it 
ted_1378_0547940_0552180 but for african americans in this country that was an era defined by terror 
ted_1378_0552910_0559000 many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives 
ted_1378_0559000_0580980 and these older people come up to me now and they say mr stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after nine eleven he told me to say no tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism would of course was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid 
ted_1378_0582250_0587890 yet we have in this country this dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems 
ted_1378_0587890_0589910 we don't like to talk about our history 
ted_1378_0590410_0596140 and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically 
ted_1378_0596870_0598430 we're constantly running into each other 
ted_1378_0598430_0600860 we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts 
ted_1378_0601130_0609420 we have a hard time talking about race and i believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation 
ted_1378_0609420_0615780 in south africa people understood that we couldn't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation 
ted_1378_0616380_0620490 rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that 
ted_1378_0621010_0624570 was giving this lecture in germany and lectures in germany about the death penalty 
ted_1378_0624570_0659840 it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about said when we don't have the death penalty in germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in attentional deliberate way set about executing people and i thought about that 
ted_1378_0660920_0669170 what would you like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately jewish 
ted_1378_0669200_0671550 i couldn't bear it 
ted_1378_0671550_0673000 would be unconscionable 
ted_1378_0673660_0691310 yet in this country in the states of the old south we execute people we are eleven times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim his wife and if the victim is black twenty two times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and addictiveness light in a very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched 
ted_1378_0691480_0693780 yet there is this just connect 
ted_1378_0695700_0698520 i believe that our identity is at risk 
ted_1378_0700060_0728510 when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love innovation we love technology we loved creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalisation 
ted_1378_0729330_0732160 for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two 
ted_1378_0733150_0742560 because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world 
ted_1378_0742840_0752030 would that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to ten 
ted_1378_0752920_0756600 but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives 
ted_1378_0757240_0763800 ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are 
ted_1378_0764130_0770960 innovation creativity development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone 
ted_1378_0770970_0776310 come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart 
ted_1378_0777230_0789020 that mind heart connection that i believe compels us to not just be tend to attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things 
ted_1378_0790230_0804770 hobbled a great czech leader talked about this he said when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be and hopeless places and be a witness 
ted_1378_0805460_0814250 that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted community's have to be engaged 
ted_1378_0815070_0827920 there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering from poverty to exclusion to unfairness to injustice 
ted_1378_0827920_0836450 i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this 
ted_1378_0837400_0838320 it will get to you 
ted_1378_0838450_0841680 i had the great privilege when i was a young lawyer meeting rosa parks 
ted_1378_0841710_0858850 ms parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends with older women johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott amazing african american woman and virginia dare a white woman whose husband clifford there are represented dr king 
ted_1378_0858850_0860810 and these women would get together and just talk 
ted_1378_0861150_0865530 and every now and then this car would calm and she'd say brian ms parks is coming to town 
ted_1378_0865540_0875980 we don't get together and talk to you want to come over and listen and i'd say yes ma'am i do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here i said i'm going to listen and i'd go work than i would i would just listen 
ted_1378_0875980_0878420 it would be so energizing and so empowering 
ted_1378_0878420_0889790 one time i was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours ms parks turned to me and she said brian tell me what the equal justice initiative is tell me which are trying to do and began giving her my rap 
ted_1378_0905760_0924410 we're trying to en mass incarceration i gave her my whole rapid when i finished she looked at me and she said she said that's going to make you tired tyre tire and that's when this carly encourage you put your finger my patients and that's why you've got to be brave brave brave 
ted_1378_0925920_0930190 i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous 
ted_1378_0931270_0936380 we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering 
ted_1378_0937120_0940950 because ultimately our humanity depends on everyone's humanity 
ted_1378_0941450_0943560 learned very simple things doing the work that i do 
ted_1378_0943670_0945210 just taught me very simple things 
ted_1378_0945270_0952080 i've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done 
ted_1378_0952630_0955340 i believe that for every person on the planet 
ted_1378_0956140_0962420 i think if somebody tells a lie there not just a liar i think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just that 
ted_1378_0962420_0965550 even if you kill someone you're not just to kill 
ted_1378_0966060_0970170 and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law 
ted_1378_0971210_0988300 i also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this glow that the opposite of poverty is not wealth i don't believe that i actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is justice 
ted_1378_0989070_1006980 finally i believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect in reason 
ted_1378_1007000_1017930 ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they think the rich and the powerful and the privilege but by how they treat the poor the condemned the incarcerated 
ted_1378_1018310_1024310 because it's in that nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are 
ted_1378_1026530_1032450 sometimes get out of balance i'll end with this story i sometimes push too hard i do get tired as we all do 
ted_1378_1032740_1037100 sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important 
ted_1378_1037970_1041970 and i've been representing these kids who'd been sentenced to death is very harsh sentences 
ted_1378_1041970_1047170 when i go to the jail and i see my client was thirteen and fourteen and has been certified to stand tall as an adult 
ted_1378_1047200_1049050 and start thinking well how did that happen 
ted_1378_1049540_1066710 how can a judge turn you into something that you're not in the judges certified as an adult but i see this kid and i was up to late one night and i started thinking gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power behind the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of it 
ted_1378_1067280_1070690 because i was up too late wasn't thinking real street i started working on emotion 
ted_1378_1071350_1074300 i had a client was fourteen years old and young poor black kids 
ted_1378_1074300_1083780 start working on this motion within the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor fourteen year old blackmail client like a privileged white seventy five year old corporate executive 
ted_1378_1088915_1089115 applause 
ted_1378_1089840_1094440 i put in my motion control misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct 
ted_1378_1094440_1098100 it was a crazy line and they're about how there's no conduct in this county it's all misconduct 
ted_1378_1098100_1107400 in the next morning i woke up and i thought and it did i dream that crazy motion or did i actually write it into my horror not only had i have written it but i had senate to court 
ted_1378_1110480_1110680 
ted_1378_1111020_1115220 months went by and i just had forgotten all about it 
ted_1378_1115790_1122990 and i finally decided oh gosh i've got to go to the court and do this crazy case and i got in my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed 
ted_1378_1123970_1128740 i got in my car and went to the courthouse and what this has been be so difficult so so painful 
ted_1378_1129200_1131920 and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse 
ted_1378_1131930_1137140 and as i was walking up the steps of this court house it was an older black man who was the janitor in the courthouse 
ted_1378_1137200_1146400 when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you i said i'm a lawyer he said you a lawyer i said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me 
ted_1378_1147410_1164960 he whispered in my ear he said i'm so proud of you and i have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community perspective that is hopeful 
ted_1378_1165650_1172240 went into the courtroom and soon as i walked inside a judge saw me coming he said mr stevenson did you write this crazy motion i said yes 
ted_1378_1172240_1175950 why didn't we started arguing people started coming in because it was just outrageous 
ted_1378_1175950_1177540 britain 's crazy things 
ted_1378_1178110_1181090 police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers 
ted_1378_1181320_1189140 before i knew it was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality 
ted_1378_1189910_1193040 and out of the corner of my eye i could see this janitor pacing back and forth 
ted_1378_1193040_1195120 and kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this 
ted_1378_1195120_1203670 and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man but it's very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at counsel table 
ted_1378_1204650_1206590 ten minutes later the judge said we would take a break 
ted_1378_1206590_1210870 and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court 
ted_1378_1211710_1228210 this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man he said jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom and this older black man stood up and he looked at ted deputy and he looked at me and he said i came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on 
ted_1378_1229180_1236870 come to ted because i believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice 
ted_1378_1237180_1242080 we cannot be full involved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity 
ted_1378_1242560_1246070 but all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone 
ted_1378_1246560_1255880 our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a vision of humanity compassion and justice 
ted_1378_1256120_1263820 more than anything for those of you who share that simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on 
ted_1378_1264060_1264870 thank you very much 
ted_1378_1285645_1285845 applause 
ted_1378_1285770_1294520 the heard and saw an obvious to buy this audience this community to help you on your way to do something on this issue 
ted_1378_1294540_1299070 other than writing a check what what could we do 
ted_1378_1299080_1301260 well there are opportunities all around 
ted_1378_1301290_1310540 we live in the state of california for example there is a referendum coming up this spring were actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment 
ted_1378_1310550_1322950 for example here in california we spend we're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars and yet forty six percent of all homicide cases don't result in a rest 
ted_1378_1323870_1325600 six percent of all rape cases don't result 
ted_1378_1325640_1327260 so there's an opportunity to change that 
ted_1378_1327410_1332530 this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety 
ted_1378_1332850_1335020 i think that opportunity exists all around us 
ted_1378_1335450_1340170 with huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades 
ted_1378_1340170_1346210 and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rate 
ted_1378_1346230_1347790 what would you say to someone who believe that 
ted_1378_1347800_1351010 well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable 
ted_1378_1351580_1356220 great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really and violent crime categories 
ted_1378_1356220_1361380 it was this misguided war on drugs that would that's where the dramatic increases of calm and our prison pop 
ted_1378_1363920_1366570 we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment 
ted_1378_1366570_1376910 and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they are victimized 
ted_1378_1377170_1381560 i believe we need to do more to help people who were victimized by crime not do less 
ted_1378_1381650_1385130 and i think our current punishment philosophy that nothing for no one 
ted_1378_1385480_1387300 and i think that's the orientation that we have to change 
ted_1378_1389805_1390005 applause 
ted_1378_1389930_1392340 a massive cord 
ted_1378_1392850_1393710 if you're an inspiring 
ted_1378_1394340_1396090 so much time 
ted_1381_0013950_0034820 years ago i started a program to try to get the rock star trek and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represent pretty much everything they're supposed to hate we have them work in government program called code for america and it's a little bit like a peace corps fergie 
ted_1381_0035220_0040280 we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city government 
ted_1381_0040720_0045170 instead of sending them off into the third world we send them into the wilds of city hall 
ted_1381_0045560_0047990 there they make great apps they work with city staffers 
ted_1381_0048040_0052230 really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible with technology today 
ted_1381_0053380_0057130 so meet our al if a fire hydrant and city of boston 
ted_1381_0057730_0068290 here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date but it was really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires when he's covered in four feet of snow 
ted_1381_0068670_0071910 how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner 
ted_1381_0072940_0076460 we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program 
ted_1381_0076460_0079810 we were there in february and it snowed a lot in february last year 
ted_1381_0080130_0083440 they noticed that the city never get to digging out the fire hydrants 
ted_1381_0083440_0093070 but one fellow in particular a guy named erik michaels ober noticed something else and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things 
ted_1381_0093700_0096390 so he did what any good developer would do he wrote an app 
ted_1381_0097120_0099690 for cute little after you can adopt a fire hydrant 
ted_1381_0099880_0102020 you agree to dig it out when it snows 
ted_1381_0102050_0104560 if you do you get to name it he called the first one 
ted_1381_0105990_0107690 and if you don't someone can steal it from you 
ted_1381_0107690_0110170 so it's got cute little game dynamics on it 
ted_1381_0111650_0112990 this is a modest little laugh 
ted_1381_0112990_0116370 it 's probably the smallest of the twenty one apps that the fellows wrote last year 
ted_1381_0116790_0120120 but it's doing something that no other government technology does 
ted_1381_0120700_0122330 spreading virally 
ted_1381_0123300_0133720 the guy in the i t department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it not for snow but you get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens 
ted_1381_0134460_0138830 it 's very important that the tsunami sirens work that people feel the batteries out of them 
ted_1381_0138830_0140670 so he's getting citizens to check on them 
ted_1381_0141130_0145860 in seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains 
ted_1381_0146500_0150530 in chicago just rolled out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows 
ted_1381_0151450_0155250 we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this 
ted_1381_0155570_0159190 this is spread just frictionlessly organically naturally 
ted_1381_0159920_0164690 if you know anything about government analogy you know that this doesn't isn't how it normally goes 
ted_1381_0165270_0167730 procuring software usually take the couple of years 
ted_1381_0168650_0174020 we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months 
ted_1381_0174240_0178260 with a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids 
ted_1381_0179100_0187030 we were told afterwards that if that had gone through normal channels it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars 
ted_1381_0188000_0188840 nothing 
ted_1381_0188850_0196990 is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars and it doesn't work 
ted_1381_0197840_0200790 projects like this at every level of government 
ted_1381_0201910_0210530 soon after take a couple of days to write and then spread virally that sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government 
ted_1381_0211070_0221930 suggests how government could work better not more like a private company as many people think it should not even more like a tech company but more like the internet itself 
ted_1381_0228950_0242490 and that's important but with more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government not the problem of an ossified institution but as a problem of collective action 
ted_1381_0243490_0248750 that 's great news because it turns out were very good at collective action with digital technology 
ted_1381_0249730_0255280 is a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively 
ted_1381_0255930_0264450 not just code for america fellows there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic at every day in their own communities 
ted_1381_0265630_0267350 they haven't given up on government 
ted_1381_0268130_0272910 are frustrated hell with it but they're not complaining about it they're fixing it 
ted_1381_0273950_0276510 folks know something that we'd lost sight of 
ted_1381_0277260_0293160 not that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the dmv and all the other things that were really mad about government is at its core in the words of tim o reilly what we do together that we can't do alone 
ted_1381_0295770_0297620 a lot of people have given up on government 
ted_1381_0297950_0303770 if you're one of those people i would ask that you reconsider because things are changing 
ted_1381_0304810_0308370 politics is not changing government is changing 
ted_1381_0309650_0318650 and because government ultimately derives its power from us remember we the people how we think about it is going to affect how that change happen 
ted_1381_0320370_0323320 i didn't know very much about government when i started this program 
ted_1381_0323380_0327310 unlike a lot of people i thought government with basically about getting people elected to office 
ted_1381_0328290_0334220 well after two years i've come to the conclusion that especially local government is about possums 
ted_1381_0335610_0338610 because the call center for the services and information line 
ted_1381_0338620_0342090 generally where you will get if you call three when one in your city 
ted_1381_0343090_0357940 if you should ever have the chance to staff universities call center as our fellow scott silverman did as part of the program in fact they all do that you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues including having a possum stuck in your house 
ted_1381_0358410_0359700 scott gets this call 
ted_1381_0359700_0364680 he tried to pass them into this official that knowledge base he doesn't really come up with anything 
ted_1381_0364680_0366000 it starts with animal control 
ted_1381_0366000_0373430 and finally he says look can you just open all the doors to your health and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves that work 
ted_1381_0373430_0374930 they offer scott 
ted_1381_0376000_0377780 but that wasn't the end of the parthenon 
ted_1381_0377950_0379970 boston doesn't just had a call center 
ted_1381_0380460_0383210 it has an app a web and mobile app called citizens connect 
ted_1381_0383550_0384640 we didn't write this 
ted_1381_0384640_0388840 is the work of the very smart people in the office of new urban mechanics in boston 
ted_1381_0389090_0394350 one day this is an actual report this came in possum in my trashcan can't 
ted_1381_0394350_0400450 tell if it's dead how do i get this removed but what happens when citizens connect is different 
ted_1381_0400450_0407280 first got with speaking person to person and citizens connect everything is public so everybody can see this 
ted_1381_0407510_0409350 and in this case a neighbor side 
ted_1381_0409400_0421930 the next report we got said i walked over to this location found a trashcan behind the house popham check living gap turn trashcan on a tide walked home goodnight three path 
ted_1381_0424605_0424805 coverage 
ted_1381_0424730_0427750 empire though this is great 
ted_1381_0427760_0429890 the digital meeting with the physical 
ted_1381_0430180_0433720 and it's also a great example of government getting in on a on the crowd sourcing game 
ted_1381_0434260_0437170 but it's also a great example of government as a platform 
ted_1381_0437780_0441550 i don't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here 
ted_1381_0441550_0446130 just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others 
ted_1381_0447280_0451650 the one that has been helped another citizen but government played a key role here 
ted_1381_0451650_0453470 it connected those two people 
ted_1381_0454390_0461870 it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services 
ted_1381_0462400_0466030 when one neighbor helps another we strengthen our communities 
ted_1381_0466630_0469390 we call animal control it just costs a lot of money 
ted_1381_0471430_0476760 one of the important things we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing as politics 
ted_1381_0477070_0480720 most people get that but they think that one is the input to the other 
ted_1381_0481260_0484230 but our input to the system of government is voting 
ted_1381_0485380_0500960 how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs and then not that much changes 
ted_1381_0502490_0508680 because government is like a vast ocean and politics to the thick thin layer on top 
ted_1381_0509520_0512440 and we're thunder that is what we call bureaucracy 
ted_1381_0513910_0516600 we say that word with such contempt 
ted_1381_0517210_0529140 but it's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for something that's working against at this other thing and then we're disempowering ourselves 
ted_1381_0530100_0532270 people seem to think politics is sexy 
ted_1381_0532760_0537780 if we want this institution to work for us we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy 
ted_1381_0538750_0541480 because that's where the real work of government happen 
ted_1381_0542330_0544720 we have to engage with the machinery of government 
ted_1381_0545100_0547880 so that's what the occupy movement has done 
ted_1381_0547880_0548940 have you seen these guys 
ted_1381_0549260_0559350 a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed three hundred and twenty five page report that's a response to the atrophies requests for comment on the financial reform bill 
ted_1381_0559940_0564010 not being politically active that being bureaucratically active 
ted_1381_0566040_0572780 for those of us who have given up on government it's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children 
ted_1381_0573770_0577430 you have to see the enormous challenges that they're going to face 
ted_1381_0578520_0585630 do we really think we're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us 
ted_1381_0586350_0590840 we can't do without government but we do need it to be more effective 
ted_1381_0591580_0602020 the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually fail by strengthening civil society 
ted_1381_0602680_0612130 and there's a generation out there that's grown up on the internet and they know that it's not that hard to do things together you just have to architect systems the right way 
ted_1381_0614010_0620570 the average age of our fellow is twenty eight so i am begrudgingly almost a generation older than most of them 
ted_1381_0621850_0625630 generation has grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted 
ted_1381_0626740_0632280 we 're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting about who gets to speak they all get to speak 
ted_1381_0632810_0637270 can express their opinion on any channel at any time and they do 
ted_1381_0638140_0651180 so when they are faced with the problem of government they don't care as much about using their voices through using their hands they're using their hands to write applications that make government work better 
ted_1381_0652110_0656870 those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better 
ted_1381_0658110_0663920 it could be shoveling out a hydrant pulling a weed turning over a garbage can with the parthenon 
ted_1381_0665430_0670370 certainly we could have been shoveling out the fire hydrants all along and many people do 
ted_1381_0670950_0680210 with these apps are like little digital reminders that we're not just consumers and we're not just consumers of government putting in our taxes and getting back services 
ted_1381_0681160_0689060 were more than that were citizens and we're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship 
ted_1381_0690720_0707150 so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big important things that we need to do together all of us together are we just going to be a crowd of voices or are we also going to be a crowd of hands 
ted_1381_0708200_0708680 thank you 
ted_1381_0721880_0722080 applause 
ted_1404_0012980_0016210 this may sound strange but i'm a big fan of the concrete block 
ted_1404_0016710_0025660 concrete block for manufactured in ancient sixty eight it was very simple idea modules or made of cement have a fixed measurement tactic together 
ted_1404_0026680_0030860 very quickly concrete block became the most used construction unit in the world 
ted_1404_0031360_0036800 they enabled us to build things that were larger than us building bridges one brick at a time 
ted_1404_0037480_0040840 essentially concrete blocks have become the building block of our time 
ted_1404_0042450_0046520 almost one hundred years later in one hundred and forty seven lego came up with it 
ted_1404_0047120_0048970 and what's called the automatic binding brick 
ted_1404_0049420_0053800 and in a few short years lego bricks took place in every household 
ted_1404_0054060_0059610 estimated that over four hundred billion bricks have been produced or seventy five brick for every person on the planet 
ted_1404_0060670_0065150 you didn't have to be an engineered to make beautiful how the beautiful bridges beautiful building 
ted_1404_0065380_0066770 lego made it accessible 
ted_1404_0067240_0073390 illegal had essentially taken the concrete block the building block of the world and made it into the building block of our imagination 
ted_1404_0074610_0080640 meanwhile the exact same year at bell labs the next revolution was about to be a noun the next building block 
ted_1404_0081050_0089450 but a transistor with a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything with interactive 
ted_1404_0090400_0096800 unlike the concrete block the transistor allows you to build much larger more complex circuits one brick at a time 
ted_1404_0097030_0100710 but there is the main befriend the transistor was only for expert 
ted_1404_0101170_0107690 i personally don't accept this that the building block of our time is reserve tracks that so i decided to change that 
ted_1404_0109420_0116760 eight years ago when i was at the media lab i felt exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers 
ted_1404_0117820_0120000 a few years ago i started developing littlebits 
ted_1404_0120290_0121530 so let me show you how they work 
ted_1404_0124570_0129780 a little bit or electronic module with each one specific function 
ted_1404_0130560_0142770 pre engineered to be light found motor and centers and the best part about it is they snap together with magnet 
ted_1404_0143120_0144830 so you can't put them the wrong way 
ted_1404_0146220_0147630 the bricks are color coded 
ted_1404_0147820_0152340 green 's output blew his power pincus input and oranges wire 
ted_1404_0152700_0159090 so all you need to do is not the blue to green and very quickly you can attract major making larger circuits 
ted_1404_0159130_0161780 when you put a blue to green you can make light 
ted_1404_0162420_0168370 you can put a knob and between and now you've made a little demo 
ted_1404_0170490_0179260 which are the dimmer than up for a pulse module which is here and now you've made 
ted_1404_0181740_0189370 but there for some extra punch and you've created in one thousand machines i'm going to stop them 
ted_1404_0189750_0194150 beyond beyond simple play little bits are actually pretty powerful 
ted_1404_0194670_0201210 instead of having to program to wire to solder littlebits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures 
ted_1404_0201470_0207090 so to make this blink faster or slower you would just turn the knob and basically make it faster or slower 
ted_1404_0208700_0211650 the idea behind little bit is that if the growing library 
ted_1404_0212310_0216270 we want to make every single interaction in the world into ready to use brick 
ted_1404_0216420_0220310 life found solar panels motors everything should be accessible 
ted_1404_0220760_0224070 we've been given little bits the kid and seeing them play with them 
ted_1404_0224090_0225660 and it's been an incredible experience 
ted_1404_0225690_0231160 the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don't learn at school 
ted_1404_0231360_0238120 for example how a nightlight worked or why an elevator door stays open or how an ipod response to touch 
ted_1404_0239020_0241280 we've also been taking little bit to design clothes 
ted_1404_0241310_0247230 so for example we've had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever such a plate with little bit of the material 
ted_1404_0248010_0252480 here you see with falcon paper water bottles we have jody making 
ted_1404_0258100_0258300 
ted_1404_0258155_0258355 applause 
ted_1404_0258280_0276840 a few weeks ago we took a little bit to reveal and give them to some designers with no experience and engineering whatsoever just cardboard wood and paper and told to make something here's an example of project they made a motion activated confetti canon bug but way this was actually my favorite project 
ted_1404_0278190_0285150 lobster made of plato that's afraid of the dark 
ted_1404_0289375_0289575 
ted_1404_0289700_0294730 b is not engineers littlebits became another material electronic became just another material 
ted_1404_0294990_0297500 we want to make this material accessible to everyone 
ted_1404_0297750_0299040 so let admitted open source 
ted_1404_0299060_0302430 and you can go on the website download other designed file make them yourself 
ted_1404_0302710_0310960 we want to encourage a world of creators of inventors of contributors because this world that we live in this interactive world of ours 
ted_1404_0311220_0313280 so go ahead and start inventing 
ted_1404_0313780_0314170 thank you 
ted_1404_0318660_0318860 applause 
ted_1115_0012760_0016860 had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects 
ted_1115_0016860_0026270 but the coolest project i ever worked on was around this guy this guy's name is tense tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in 
ted_1115_0026660_0031820 he came home from a run one day and said dad my legs or tingling and that was the onset of als 
ted_1115_0032430_0034600 so temps is now completely paralyzed 
ted_1115_0034620_0038550 he only has use of his eyes i was exposed to him 
ted_1115_0039290_0045890 a company that does design and animations obviously graffiti is definitely intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world 
ted_1115_0046660_0050830 so we decided that we were going to sponsor tony and attempts and his cause 
ted_1115_0050840_0087900 so i went and met with his brother and father and said we're going to give you this money what are you going to do with it and his brother said i just want to be able to talk to tony again i just want to be able to communicate with him to be able to communicate with me and i said well wait a second isn't that i've seen stephen hawking don't all paralyzed people have that ability to communicate via these devices and he said no we're unless you're in the upper echelon and you've got really amazing insurance you can actually do that at that these devices aren't accessible to people and i said well how do you actually communicate and he said we run at the germans in the movie the diving bell and the butterfly that's how they communicate so run their finger along 
ted_1115_0087900_0089260 as best i can 
ted_1115_0089260_0090140 how can that be 
ted_1115_0090680_0099560 so i showed up with the desire to just write a check and instead i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash 
ted_1115_0100320_0108960 committed to his brother and his father right then and there and here's the deal tony's going to speak we're going to get him a machine and we're going to figure out a way for him to do as art again 
ted_1115_0108970_0113890 because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in them is unable to communicate it 
ted_1115_0114530_0116580 so i spoke at a conference couple of months after that 
ted_1115_0116940_0128520 these guys called grl graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to project the light on any surface and then with a laser pointer draw on it and it just registers the negative space 
ted_1115_0128530_0131550 so they go around and do art installations like this 
ted_1115_0132170_0134390 all the things that go up there they said there's a life cycle 
ted_1115_0134470_0143250 first it starts with the sexual organs then it starts with cuss words that it was bush slanders and then people actually got to art 
ted_1115_0143250_0144930 but there was always a life cycle presentation 
ted_1115_0146820_0160630 so i went home and i was having dinner with my wife and was telling about this and we were like well wait a second if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things why don't we figure out a way for attempts to control the laser and he can do graph again without the awesome 
ted_1115_0160990_0162270 so that started the journey 
ted_1115_0162350_0171600 about two years later about a year later after a bunch of organization and a bunch of kind of moving things around we'd accomplished a couple of things 
ted_1115_0171600_0183080 one we battered down the doors of the insurance companies and we actually got tempt a machine that lead and communicate stephen hawking machine which was awful 
ted_1115_0183080_0190250 and he is seriously one of the funny column yoda because you talk to the guy you get an email from him and you're like i'm just not worthy this guy's so amazing 
ted_1115_0190850_0197770 the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house 
ted_1115_0198140_0206620 and my wife and kids and i moved to our back garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house 
ted_1115_0206660_0213510 a lot of our friends that we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall will be removed and graph on the wall 
ted_1115_0214350_0226980 but for over two weeks we programmed we went to the venice boardwalk my kids got involved my dog got involved and we created this 
ted_1115_0227460_0231160 so this is called the writer and you can see the description 
ted_1115_0231670_0239640 is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought into venice beach boardwalk some copper wire and some stuff from home depot and radio shack 
ted_1115_0240240_0251670 we took a ps three camera hacked it open to manage and lead delight and now there's a device that is free you build this yourself we published the code for free you download the software for free 
ted_1115_0252010_0255830 and now we've created a device that has absolutely no limitation 
ted_1115_0256050_0265310 but there's no insurance company that can say no there's no there's no hospital that can say no anybody who's paralyzed now has access to actually draw communicate using either 
ted_1115_0275090_0275290 
ted_1115_0276030_0282780 thank you thank you guys very much that was awesome 
ted_1115_0283470_0289200 so at the end of the two weeks we went back attempts room 
ted_1115_0289610_0292630 i love this picture because this is someone else has room and that says 
ted_1115_0292630_0295220 with all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling 
ted_1115_0295790_0305270 after over a year of planning two weeks of programming and carved fast and all night session tony drew again for the first time and seven years 
ted_1115_0305570_0311410 this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system and he's looking over his life support system 
ted_1115_0311410_0313590 with kicked his bed so that he could see 
ted_1115_0313830_0318330 we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital 
ted_1115_0318600_0326550 he drew again for the first time in front of his family and friends and it's just like you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was 
ted_1115_0326670_0330970 the funny thing is we had to break into the parking lot to so we totally felt like we were legit and the whole grafting 
ted_1115_0330965_0331165 
ted_1115_0333630_0349330 so at the end of this he sent us an email and this is what the email said that was the first time i've drawn anything for seven years i feel like i've been held underwater and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i can breathe and asked 
ted_1115_0352505_0352705 
ted_1115_0352830_0355700 so that's kind of our battle cry 
ted_1115_0355770_0358260 will just keep that's what keeps us going and keeps us develop 
ted_1115_0358260_0360280 and we've got such a long way to go with this 
ted_1115_0361430_0364380 this is an amazing device but it's the equivalent of an etch a sketch 
ted_1115_0364400_0367540 when someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserved so much more 
ted_1115_0367540_0371640 so we're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better faster stronger 
ted_1115_0372350_0375490 since that time we had all kinds of acknowledgment 
ted_1115_0375790_0376970 we want a bunch of awards 
ted_1115_0377090_0379410 remember it's free none of us are making money on this thing 
ted_1115_0379410_0380490 it's all coming out of our own pocket 
ted_1115_0380500_0389310 so the words were like oh this is fantastic armstrong twittered about us and then in december of time magazine honor this is one of the top fifty inventions of two thousand and ten 
ted_1115_0389255_0389455 
ted_1115_0392230_0411640 coolest thing about this and this is what kind of completing the whole circle isn't in april of this year at the geffen moca in downtown los angeles there's going to be an exhibition called art of the streets and are the streets is going to have pretty much the bad assets of the street art scene banks the shepard fairey cause all of these guys will be there 
ted_1115_0412910_0415710 camps going to be on the show 
ted_1115_0415635_0415835 
ted_1115_0418580_0426140 so basically this is my point if you see something that's not possible make it possible 
ted_1115_0426390_0433240 everything in this room was impossible this stage this computer this mike the eyewriter was impossible at one point 
ted_1115_0433550_0435380 make it possible everyone in this room 
ted_1115_0435430_0444560 i 'm not a programmer never done anything with ocular recognition technology but i just recognized something and associate myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen 
ted_1115_0444720_0452580 this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something that you feel that needs to be done if not now then when 
ted_1115_0453060_0454300 not me 
ted_1115_0454970_0455410 thank you 
ted_1115_0459855_0460055 
ted_1131_0012790_0015630 would you like to be better than you are 
ted_1131_0016800_0026210 suppose i said that with just a few changes in your genes you can get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker 
ted_1131_0027170_0035040 or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self confident 
ted_1131_0036230_0038640 how about living longer with good health 
ted_1131_0039810_0044120 or perhaps you're one of those who has always yearned for more creativity 
ted_1131_0044290_0046910 which one would you like the most 
ted_1131_0048560_0053130 which would you like if you could have just one creativity 
ted_1131_0054610_0062410 how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good 
ted_1131_0063750_0065210 how many would opt for memory 
ted_1131_0067310_0075620 quite a few more how about fitness few less what about longevity the majority 
ted_1131_0075620_0077490 that makes me feel very good as a doctor 
ted_1131_0078260_0088220 if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible 
ted_1131_0088970_0097590 evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference but i want to give you today one doctors take on the subject 
ted_1131_0098790_0147740 the great twentieth century geneticist p g dubbed jansky who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device i give you permission and perhaps take another look at catherine shelters book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future 
ted_1131_0153460_0155790 is another look at the tree of life 
ted_1131_0156380_0176580 in this picture i put a bush with a center branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment 
ted_1131_0177950_0186870 the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in 
ted_1131_0187230_0194310 we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago 
ted_1131_0194850_0200940 in the interval they've been perhaps twenty or twenty five different species of hominids 
ted_1131_0201770_0203840 some have come and gone 
ted_1131_0204140_0207680 we have been here for about one hundred and thirty thousand 
ted_1131_0207910_0220980 years it may seem like were quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much 
ted_1131_0221240_0232440 do you realize that we can take advantage in commandeered the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics 
ted_1131_0232500_0241930 is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas 
ted_1131_0243150_0252650 speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body 
ted_1131_0252990_0254280 and maybe ten times more 
ted_1131_0254630_0261480 think of it when anthony dimasi last about your self image do you think about the bacteria 
ted_1131_0263380_0267300 our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria 
ted_1131_0267310_0270890 it's warm it's dark its moist it's very cozy 
ted_1131_0271220_0275560 and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part 
ted_1131_0275560_0292870 it's really like an easy street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended forced rushed to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life 
ted_1131_0292900_0298590 they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases 
ted_1131_0299910_0301860 but what will come in the future 
ted_1131_0301950_0306350 are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species 
ted_1131_0306570_0314820 or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment 
ted_1131_0316110_0344480 well let's take a step back in time to the big bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four and a half billion years the first signs of pro life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi celled organisms perhaps as much as eight hundred or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last one hundred and thirty thousand 
ted_1131_0344490_0366880 for years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so i hope you enjoy 
ted_1131_0368570_0368770 applause 
ted_1131_0369110_0374470 when i was a freshman in college i took my first biology class 
ted_1131_0374810_0379030 i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology 
ted_1131_0379080_0396000 i became enamored of the power of evolution and i realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life of single celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells 
ted_1131_0396440_0402100 but at the time multi celled organisms come online things start to change 
ted_1131_0402210_0405030 sexual reproduction enters the picture 
ted_1131_0405930_0415900 very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable 
ted_1131_0416240_0427960 in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters an evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction 
ted_1131_0428640_0443520 now i have to confess when i was a college undergraduate i thought ok sex death sex death that for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing year as i've come to have increasing doubts 
ted_1131_0443520_0449830 come to understand the sentiments of george burns who was performing still in las vegas well into his nineties 
ted_1131_0450120_0452720 one night there's a knock at his hotel room door 
ted_1131_0452720_0453800 he answered the door 
ted_1131_0453970_0457790 standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl 
ted_1131_0458000_0465200 looks at him and says i'm here for super sex that's fine says george i'll take bar soup 
ted_1131_0466445_0466645 applause 
ted_1131_0469450_0482530 i came to realize as a position that i was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different 
ted_1131_0482550_0489220 i was trying to preserve the body i wanted to keep us healthy i wanted to restore health from disease 
ted_1131_0489230_0492080 wanted us to live long and healthy lives 
ted_1131_0492200_0502790 evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation 
ted_1131_0503010_0514010 from an evolutionary point of view you and i are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea 
ted_1131_0514350_0523590 but i think we would all understand the sediment that woody allen expressed when he said i don't want to achieve immortality through my work i want to achieve it through not die 
ted_1131_0523555_0523755 
ted_1131_0526640_0530720 evolution does not necessarily favored the longest lived 
ted_1131_0531200_0536890 it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest 
ted_1131_0536910_0544100 evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment 
ted_1131_0544390_0548400 that is the sole test of survival and success 
ted_1131_0548610_0566220 at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce a fish where they are soon need cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them 
ted_1131_0567020_0589060 so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase i would say that there are a number of possibilities 
ted_1131_0589520_0593720 the first is that we will not evil 
ted_1131_0594660_0597620 we have reached a kind of equitable 
ted_1131_0598250_0609140 the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population 
ted_1131_0609400_0619870 secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it 
ted_1131_0620120_0631490 and by the way we integrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place 
ted_1131_0632160_0640890 second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature 
ted_1131_0641600_0648540 the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable 
ted_1131_0649180_0661490 as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way 
ted_1131_0662230_0667990 but there's a third possibility and enticing intriguing and frightening possibility 
ted_1131_0668010_0681290 i call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make 
ted_1131_0681920_0684000 how could this come about 
ted_1131_0684560_0687110 how could it be possible that we would do this 
ted_1131_0687220_0696250 consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring 
ted_1131_0696730_0700970 bear in some cultures choosing to have more males than females 
ted_1131_0701310_0706520 not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family or choose 
ted_1131_0708130_0724800 also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases 
ted_1131_0724800_0734060 what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke 
ted_1131_0734160_0739890 wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes 
ted_1131_0740850_0748390 if we look ahead these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible 
ted_1131_0749340_0755620 the human genome project started in one thousand nine hundred and ninety and it took thirteen years 
ted_1131_0755940_0759190 it costs two point seven billion dollars 
ted_1131_0760650_0768080 a year after it was finished in two thousand and four you could do the same job for twenty million dollars in three to four months 
ted_1131_0768590_0777230 today you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and in the space of about two 
ted_1131_0777230_0785980 week it won't be very long before the reality will be the one thousand dollar human genome and it will be increasingly available 
ted_1131_0785990_0837960 for everyone just a week ago the national academy of engineering awarded its draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what francis arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the lasker prize was awarded to the scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cells fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell or sell potentially capable of becoming any cell in 
ted_1131_0839550_0852720 these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses 
ted_1131_0852760_0862690 believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant 
ted_1131_0863600_0865960 can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco 
ted_1131_0867270_0873360 these are all reality today and the future will be ever more possible 
ted_1131_0873560_0877910 imagine then just to other little changes 
ted_1131_0878100_0883980 can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring 
ted_1131_0884140_0897370 what if you could change the sperm and the over or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer 
ted_1131_0897570_0899600 who doesn't want healthier children 
ted_1131_0900180_0919410 then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory 
ted_1131_0919410_0927070 why not have the quick wit of a ken jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the wattson machine 
ted_1131_0927820_0933110 why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer 
ted_1131_0933830_0936420 why not live longer 
ted_1131_0937220_0939230 these will be irresistible 
ted_1131_0939770_0954440 and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution 
ted_1131_0954450_0963900 we will take a process that normally might require one hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to one thousand years and maybe even in the next one hundred years 
ted_1131_0963900_0972390 because these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before 
ted_1131_0973330_0982020 will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder 
ted_1131_0982300_0989590 or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us 
ted_1131_0989950_0998310 will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile 
ted_1131_0998590_1002160 these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face 
ted_1131_1002160_1012750 in most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that will need to make these choices wisely 
ted_1131_1012780_1019530 for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us 
ted_1131_1020050_1032980 
ted_1131_1032905_1033105 applause 
ted_1137_0012920_0038850 battling to everybody and i got some good to show you think about this is the pixel a flying 
ted_1137_0040120_0042950 is what we call in our lab sensible design 
ted_1137_0043060_0044120 let me tell you a bit about it 
ted_1137_0044540_0058740 if you take this picture i'm italian or each and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i'm showing you this is that some very interesting happened in formula one racing over the past couple of decades 
ted_1137_0059220_0067320 now some time ago if you wanted to in formula one race you take a budget and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car 
ted_1137_0067880_0071050 if the car and driver weren't good enough then you win the race 
ted_1137_0071400_0100020 today if you want to win the race actually you need also something like this sunday monitors the card in real time has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car transmitted this information into the system and then processing it in using it in order to go back to the car with the decisions and changing things in real time information is collected this is what in engineering terms you could call them real time control system 
ted_1137_0100200_0105770 basically it's a system made of two components sensing and an actuating component 
ted_1137_0106280_0112230 what 's interesting today is that real time control system are entering starting to enter into our lives 
ted_1137_0112580_0119110 our cities over the past few years just had been blanketed with networks electronics 
ted_1137_0119310_0121560 becoming like computers in open air 
ted_1137_0121980_0128170 computers in open air decided to respond in a different way to be able to be sent into be actually 
ted_1137_0128720_0130670 if we fix it is actually it's a big deal 
ted_1137_0130680_0138690 adjusting as an aside i wanted to mention cities are only two percent of the earth's class but they are fifty percent of the world's population 
ted_1137_0139000_0144880 seventy five percent of the energy consumption up to eighty percent of c two emissions 
ted_1137_0145300_0148200 able to do something we'd sit is that it's a big deal 
ted_1137_0148740_0155050 beyond cities all of this sensing evacuating is entering our everyday objects 
ted_1137_0155550_0161630 from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year during the summer 
ted_1137_0161630_0166600 is called talk to me with our objects our environment is starting to talk back to us 
ted_1137_0166880_0173060 in a certain sense it's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both his sensor into nachtwey 
ted_1137_0173060_0178880 it is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there 
ted_1137_0179160_0194830 in a certain sense it's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo michelangelo sculpted the moses at the end he said that he took the hammer through the moses attributes he'll see small chip underneath inside that shouted but a badly 
ted_1137_0194980_0200000 why don't you talk with today for the first time our environment is starting to talk back to us 
ted_1137_0200330_0205590 show just a few examples again with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating 
ted_1137_0206160_0213030 blitzer sensing well the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab 
ted_1137_0213070_0215830 it was a four and a half years ago in italy 
ted_1137_0216140_0232030 what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time it had been deployed when all across the world that's a cellphone network news anonymous and aggregated information from the network that's collected anyway by the operator is not to understand how the city works 
ted_1137_0232450_0235360 with summer was a lucky summer two thousand and six 
ted_1137_0235710_0237750 when italy won the soccer world cup 
ted_1137_0238590_0243110 some of you might remember was italy and france playing and then the dan at the end head back 
ted_1137_0243110_0244760 and anyway italy won again 
ted_1137_0245015_0245215 
ted_1137_0245240_0253010 and now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network 
ted_1137_0253700_0254800 here you see the city 
ted_1137_0255550_0261030 see the colosseum in the middle the river tiber it 
ted_1137_0261040_0263110 this morning before the match 
ted_1137_0263620_0265120 the timeline on the top 
ted_1137_0266260_0270220 early afternoon people here and they're making calls and moving 
ted_1137_0271560_0282820 the match begins silence france scores italy scores halftime people make a quick call and go to the bathroom second half into normal time 
ted_1137_0283270_0285300 first overtime cycle 
ted_1137_0285760_0298540 down to head back in a moment italy wins yeah well here tonight everybody went to celebrate in in the sanctuary 
ted_1137_0298540_0299430 so the big peak 
ted_1137_0299450_0306040 following day again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team in the prime minister at the time 
ted_1137_0306250_0307560 everybody moved down 
ted_1137_0307560_0315720 the image at a place called to come asimo were since roman times people go to celebrate the big parking received a peek at django today 
ted_1137_0315800_0321760 well that's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn't have done just a few years ago 
ted_1137_0322160_0328510 another quick example about sensing it's about not about people but about things we using consume 
ted_1137_0328520_0332880 well today we know everything about where our objects come from 
ted_1137_0333340_0338320 so this is a map that shows you all the chips that for me mac computer how they came together 
ted_1137_0338640_0341140 but we know very little about where things go 
ted_1137_0341140_0348300 so in this project we actually develop some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system 
ted_1137_0348580_0362900 so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped in seattle just over a year ago to tag what they were thrown away different type of things is you can see here things able to throw away any way 
ted_1137_0363480_0369000 when we put a little chip tag onto the trash and then started following 
ted_1137_0369670_0371890 here are the results we just have to 
ted_1137_0371820_0372020 
ted_1137_0375530_0413910 from seattle after one of the the with this information we realize there's a lot of inefficiencies in the system 
ted_1137_0413950_0416590 we can actually do the same thing which matchless energy 
ted_1137_0416980_0418720 beast data was not available before 
ted_1137_0418770_0422230 but a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening 
ted_1137_0422620_0437210 but the other thing is that we believe that actually if we see every day that the cap were thrown away it doesn't disappear he still somewhere on the planet into plastic both were thrown away every day a few stays there and we showed it to people then we can also promote some behavioral change 
ted_1137_0437450_0438850 so that was the reason for the project 
ted_1137_0439130_0450420 my colleague at mit assaf biderman he could tell you much more about sensing and many other things wonderful things we can do with sensory but i wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning and that's actuating our environment 
ted_1137_0450920_0455380 first project that is something we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza spain 
ted_1137_0455770_0470540 we started with a question by the mayor of the city who came to us saying that spain in southern europe can be beautiful tradition of using watering public space in architecture in the question was how could technology new technology be added today 
ted_1137_0470850_0479910 one of the ideas was developed at mit and worship was imagined good despite and you got valves solenoid valve tabs opening and closing 
ted_1137_0479910_0483290 can you create like a water curtain with pictures made a while 
ted_1137_0483330_0488640 those pictures for and you can write on it you can show patterns images texts 
ted_1137_0489020_0495180 you can approach it and you will open up to let you jump through as you see in this image 
ted_1137_0495870_0502510 we presented this may have been joke you like it very much and we got a commissioned to design a building again chance of the extra 
ted_1137_0503100_0504810 we called the digital water pavilion 
ted_1137_0505560_0507060 and the whole building is made of water 
ted_1137_0511380_0532390 but there's no doors or windows but when you approach it it will open up to let you in the room forces cover with water 
ted_1137_0534850_0546950 this would be to win if you want to minimize flashy new can actually lowered her or it could close the building and the whole architecture will disappear like in this case 
ted_1137_0547600_0558870 these days are always getting during the winter when they take the roof down with people who have been done and say you know the demolished the building and not been demolished just when it goes down to the architecture almost disappear 
ted_1137_0558920_0560580 the building working 
ted_1137_0560650_0563900 we see the person puzzled about what was going on inside 
ted_1137_0564370_0568750 it was myself trying not to get wet testing the sensors adult when the water 
ted_1137_0569280_0573310 well i should tell you what happened one night when all of the same sort of stopped working 
ted_1137_0574640_0577570 but actually that night it was even more fun 
ted_1137_0577610_0582470 the kids from cycles are came to the building because the wealth engaging with the building became something different 
ted_1137_0582480_0603880 anymore rebuilding it would open up to let you in but it needed was still make cuts in holes through the water and you had to jump without getting 
ted_1137_0603805_0604005 
ted_1137_0604100_0611670 for us was very interesting because as architects engineers as designers we always think about how people will use the things for design 
ted_1137_0611940_0613820 but then reality he's always unpredictable 
ted_1137_0613850_0617780 the beauty of of doing things that are used and interact with people 
ted_1137_0618060_0624900 here is an image of the building with the physical pixels the pixels made a water and then projections something 
ted_1137_0625190_0628630 this will lead us to think about the following project i'll show you now 
ted_1137_0629030_0631720 imagine those peaks that could actually start flying 
ted_1137_0631800_0642460 imagine you could have smaller helicopters that moving the air in each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost as a cloud that can move in space 
ted_1137_0642760_0643420 peers did 
ted_1137_0643350_0643550 
ted_1137_0650460_0664470 so imagine one helicopter like the one we saw before moving with others in synchrony so you can have this cloud 
ted_1137_0670980_0678780 you can have a kind of flexible screen or display like this irregular configuration in two dimensions 
ted_1137_0686150_0692340 for in regular but in three dimensions were the thing to change the light fixtures position 
ted_1137_0692540_0705400 you can play with the different types 
ted_1137_0705400_0712640 imagine your screen could just appear and different skies cato sizes different type of resolution 
ted_1137_0722440_0730910 but then the whole thing can be said three d kind of cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many many directions 
ted_1137_0732610_0737880 the real flyfire controlling gunned down from the regular readers before 
ted_1137_0738060_0741110 when you turn on the light actually you see this so the same we saw before 
ted_1137_0741240_0743650 imagine each of them and controlled by people 
ted_1137_0743860_0749040 you can have each pixel having an input comes from people from people's movement or so and so 
ted_1137_0749280_0751200 i wanted to show something here for the first time 
ted_1137_0751480_0764290 we've been working with the roberta bali one or two days the ballet dancer twilight metropolitan in new york and la scala in milan in actually capture his movement in three d in order to use it as an input 
ted_1137_0764290_0766940 flyfire and here you can see robert 
ted_1137_0771090_0774580 pc and the elected pictures to defend resolution being captured 
ted_1137_0774840_0778250 three d scanning in real time and motion capture 
ted_1137_0780190_0782330 so you can reconstruct the whole movement 
ted_1137_0782340_0790950 can go all the way to 
ted_1137_0793540_0800290 but then once you have the pictures then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation 
ted_1137_0801610_0804780 we want to use this as one possible inputs for life 
ted_1137_0804780_0828910 the i wanted to show you the last project we are working on it 's something we're working on for the london olympics 
ted_1137_0829180_0830160 it's called the cloud 
ted_1137_0830660_0841670 achilles imagined that again we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment in almost doing what we call cloud raising like barn raising but with the cloud 
ted_1137_0841670_0844820 imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one 
ted_1137_0845440_0854500 i think what is remarkable to tap into the past couple of years is that over the past couple of decades we went from the physical world to the digital ones 
ted_1137_0854660_0858620 this has been digitizing everything knowledge and making that accessible through the internet 
ted_1137_0859020_0867730 today for the first time in the obama campaign showed us that we can go from the digital world from the self organizing power of networks to the physical one 
ted_1137_0868610_0872420 it can be in our case we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol 
ted_1137_0872450_0874270 some can build in a city 
ted_1137_0874700_0884030 but tomorrow he can be in order to tackle today's pressing challenges think about climate change or two emission how we can go from the digital world to the physical 
ted_1137_0884250_0888500 so the idea that can we actually involved people in doing this thing together collectively 
ted_1137_0888810_0895090 the cloud is is a cloud again made of pixels in the same way is a real clout is a live images particles 
ted_1137_0895270_0898960 those particles and water where our cloud is a cloud of pixels 
ted_1137_0899020_0901770 physical structure in london but covered with pixels 
ted_1137_0902020_0904610 if you can move inside different types of experiences 
ted_1137_0904610_0914980 so you can actually see from underneath that sharing domain moments for the olympics in two thousand and twelve and beyond a really using it as a way to connect with the community 
ted_1137_0915110_0926150 so both physical cloud into the sky and something you can go to the top like a london's new mountaintop you can enter inside it 
ted_1137_0926570_0934440 the kind of new digital beacon for the night but most importantly a new type of experience for anybody who will go through it 
ted_1137_0934860_0935870 thank you 
ted_1137_0935795_0935995 
ted_1144_0012920_0033770 my name is on an eighteen month ago i had another job at google and i pitched the idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss was actually here and she allowed me to do it and it took eighteen months a lot of fun negotiations and stories i can tell you with seventeen very interesting museums from nine countries 
ted_1144_0034010_0035390 but i'm going to focus on the demo 
ted_1144_0036430_0039180 but a lot of stories about why we did this 
ted_1144_0039230_0043660 i think my personal story is explained rates simply in the slide and access 
ted_1144_0044000_0046120 i grew up in india 
ted_1144_0046530_0052530 had a great education and not complaining but i didn't have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks 
ted_1144_0052850_0056980 when i started traveling and go into these museums i started learning a lot 
ted_1144_0057350_0064420 while working at google i try to put the desire to make it more accessible with technology together 
ted_1144_0064700_0069350 so we formed a team a great team of people and we started doing this 
ted_1144_0069360_0075000 probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we've had since launch 
ted_1144_0075450_0081420 so simple you come to google art project dot com you look around all these museums 
ted_1144_0081440_0085430 because the uffizi you've got the moma the hermitage the right angle 
ted_1144_0085850_0090750 going to actually get to one of my favorites the metropolitan museum of art in new york 
ted_1144_0091540_0093940 cubism going in simple 
ted_1144_0094370_0096870 click and bang you're in this museum 
ted_1144_0096880_0100620 it doesn't matter where you are bombay mexico it doesn't really matter 
ted_1144_0100920_0102460 if you move around you have fun 
ted_1144_0102660_0104370 we want to navigate around the museum 
ted_1144_0104690_0107750 open plan up and in one click jump 
ted_1144_0108730_0113770 there you want to go to the end of the corridor keep going have fun explore 
ted_1144_0120325_0120525 applause 
ted_1144_0120450_0121800 signs that haven't come to the best 
ted_1144_0121725_0121925 applause 
ted_1144_0122190_0129390 so now i'm in front of one of my favorite painting the harvesters by peter bruegel at the met 
ted_1144_0129700_0130730 plus sign 
ted_1144_0130940_0133070 the museum has given up the image you click on it 
ted_1144_0133530_0134690 this is one of the images 
ted_1144_0134700_0136610 so this is all the metadata information 
ted_1144_0136640_0141530 for those of you who are truly interested or not you can click this but i'm going to click this off right now 
ted_1144_0142110_0145950 this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology 
ted_1144_0145950_0150040 so this image for example has close to i think around ten billion pixels 
ted_1144_0150120_0157010 i get a lot of people asking me what do you get for ten billion pixels so i'm going to try and show you what you really get for ten billion pixels 
ted_1144_0157420_0159160 you can zoom around very simply 
ted_1144_0159250_0161150 you see some fun stuff happening here 
ted_1144_0161620_0164090 i love this guy who's expression is priceless 
ted_1144_0164460_0166760 but but then you really want to go deep 
ted_1144_0167150_0170890 so i started playing around and i found something going on over here 
ted_1144_0171260_0172650 hold on 
ted_1144_0172700_0178700 some interesting went in and i started noticing that these kids actually beating something 
ted_1144_0179530_0190240 i did a little research spoke to a couple of my contacts with the met and actually found out that this is a game called school which involves beating a goose with a stick on shrove tuesday 
ted_1144_0190560_0192440 apparently it was quite popular 
ted_1144_0192490_0195240 i don't know why they did it but i learned something about it 
ted_1144_0195910_0199230 now just really deepened you can really get to the cracks 
ted_1144_0199240_0203210 just to give you some perspective i'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get 
ted_1144_0204540_0208250 is where we were and this is the painting 
ted_1144_0210325_0210525 
ted_1144_0210470_0225370 the best is yet to come so let's just quickly jumped into the moma again and yeah 
ted_1144_0225670_0230670 so another one of my favorite the starry night now the example i showed you was all about finding detail 
ted_1144_0231040_0232720 but what if you'd want to see brushstrokes 
ted_1144_0232750_0243180 what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece zoom in you really go and i'm going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting and i'm really going to get to the cracks 
ted_1144_0244060_0249070 this is the starry night i think i've never seen this before 
ted_1144_0249720_0251440 i'm going to show you my other favorite feature 
ted_1144_0251440_0253310 with a lot of other stuff here but i don't have time 
ted_1144_0254120_0255420 the real cool part 
ted_1144_0255510_0256620 called collections 
ted_1144_0256910_0263730 if anyone a few anybody doesn't matter if you're rich or poor if you have a fancy house doesn't matter 
ted_1144_0263730_0268050 you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images 
ted_1144_0268330_0273940 simply you go in and i've created called the power of zoom you can just zoom around 
ted_1144_0274140_0277040 the ambassadors based in the national gallery 
ted_1144_0277150_0284410 you can annotate the stuff send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you're feeling when you go through these masterpieces 
ted_1144_0284980_0292180 so i think in conclusion for me the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google 
ted_1144_0292280_0294530 it doesn't in my opinion even come from the museums 
ted_1144_0294690_0295340 we should say that 
ted_1144_0295980_0298000 it really comes from these artists 
ted_1144_0299020_0301390 that 's been my humbling experience and 
ted_1144_0301410_0307650 i mean i hope and as digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represented properly online 
ted_1144_0307920_0315990 the biggest question i get asked nowadays is did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum and the answer is no 
ted_1144_0316010_0318060 to supplement the experience 
ted_1144_0318180_0319360 that's it 
ted_1144_0322895_0323095 applause 
ted_1144_0322955_0323155 applause 
ted_1160_0013530_0017660 is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts 
ted_1160_0018240_0023410 the left half which is the logical side and the right half which is the intuitive 
ted_1160_0024140_0028990 if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain 
ted_1160_0029330_0032330 for example this would be somebody who is completely logical 
ted_1160_0032680_0035140 this would be someone who's entirely intuitive 
ted_1160_0036150_0038460 so where would you put your brain on the scale 
ted_1160_0039090_0048870 some of us may have opted for one of these extremes but i think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time 
ted_1160_0049180_0051060 felt like there mutually exclusive or anything 
ted_1160_0051060_0053170 it can be logical and intuitive 
ted_1160_0053720_0063040 i consider myself from these people along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas 
ted_1160_0063530_0068180 but at the same time we need to get to your intuition to actually make the experiments work 
ted_1160_0068770_0070160 so how do we develop this intuition 
ted_1160_0070160_0071340 well we like to play with stuff 
ted_1160_0071350_0075780 so without and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition 
ted_1160_0075780_0078770 from there and really you do the same thing 
ted_1160_0079390_0086840 so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time 
ted_1160_0087620_0096730 he even sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it 
ted_1160_0097430_0100010 and i remember watching and kid playing on a car staff 
ted_1160_0100010_0103290 he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over 
ted_1160_0103380_0112060 but i bet playing with this karstadt time a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place 
ted_1160_0113020_0118220 so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist 
ted_1160_0118450_0125060 would be a terrible model for a particle physicists because they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles 
ted_1160_0125490_0135090 and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like that can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time 
ted_1160_0136190_0142050 and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics 
ted_1160_0142690_0150550 so that's where physics was at a few years ago you need a quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles 
ted_1160_0150700_0155700 but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us 
ted_1160_0156260_0162120 didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe is just because i don't play with particles very often 
ted_1160_0162520_0165570 i play with them sometimes but not very often 
ted_1160_0166110_0170120 i have never seen them i mean nobody's ever seen a particle 
ted_1160_0171360_0173810 it didn't sit well with my logical side either 
ted_1160_0174080_0184150 because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then everything just follow quantum mechanics 
ted_1160_0186640_0188220 i don't see any reason why it shouldn't 
ted_1160_0189170_0196480 so i feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday objects also follows quantum mechanics 
ted_1160_0196960_0199680 so a few years ago i set off to do just that 
ted_1160_0200920_0209940 so i made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition 
ted_1160_0210880_0213580 so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip 
ted_1160_0213930_0217190 you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle 
ted_1160_0217270_0219720 this piece of metal and be talking about in a minute 
ted_1160_0220060_0221980 is a photograph of the object 
ted_1160_0221980_0223280 and here and zoom in a little bit 
ted_1160_0223550_0224860 we're looking right there in the center 
ted_1160_0225160_0228210 here 's a really really big close up look he's metal 
ted_1160_0228640_0233420 so we're looking at his little chunk of metal and shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge 
ted_1160_0233630_0243740 and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip i went to a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then i just cranked away at all the big machines for about one hundred hours 
ted_1160_0243990_0249370 for the last step ahead to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device 
ted_1160_0250150_0256080 device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition but it needs a little help to do it 
ted_1160_0256470_0258020 let me give you an analogy 
ted_1160_0258500_0261140 uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator 
ted_1160_0261450_0271240 when i'm an elevator although and do all sorts of weird things but then other people get on board and i stopped doing those things because i don't want to bother them and frankly scare them 
ted_1160_0274690_0278160 quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way 
ted_1160_0278540_0287290 fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room 
ted_1160_0287970_0294140 and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically we're going to kick out all the other passengers 
ted_1160_0294530_0303950 and so that's what we did we turn off the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air cooled down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero 
ted_1160_0304420_0309000 all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however at one 
ted_1160_0309250_0310380 we measured its motion 
ted_1160_0310380_0312680 we found it was moving and really weird ways 
ted_1160_0312910_0320690 instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating in the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and contracting bellows 
ted_1160_0321090_0330640 by giving it a gentle nudge were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something as only allowed with quantum mechanics 
ted_1160_0331210_0333720 so what i'm telling you here is something truly fantastic 
ted_1160_0334570_0340390 what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time 
ted_1160_0340920_0342440 so let's think about the atoms 
ted_1160_0342590_0352870 one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal or just sitting still at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down 
ted_1160_0353640_0355700 it was only a precise times and an airline 
ted_1160_0356010_0357650 for the rest of the time to localize 
ted_1160_0358520_0367240 it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places 
ted_1160_0367420_0372000 i think this is really cool 
ted_1160_0371935_0372135 applause 
ted_1160_0376110_0390150 with locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because check this out the different in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you 
ted_1160_0390830_0398540 so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time chunk of metal can be in two different places that then why not 
ted_1160_0398550_0401810 i mean this is just my logical side talking 
ted_1160_0403220_0408760 so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be late 
ted_1160_0410230_0415540 how would your consciousness handle your body being to localized in space 
ted_1160_0417130_0418380 but there's one more parts of the story 
ted_1160_0418380_0426290 when we warmed up and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box we saw the piece of metal was still there in one piece 
ted_1160_0427240_0437330 so i had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space 
ted_1160_0437860_0442190 here a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected 
ted_1160_0442870_0447250 that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that it's deeper 
ted_1160_0447710_0458120 those connections your connections to all the things around you literally define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics 
ted_1160_0458730_0459040 thank you 
ted_1160_0462555_0462755 applause 
ted_1161_0012410_0015480 jesse and this is my suitcase 
ted_1161_0015830_0025070 but before i show you what i've got inside i'm going to make a very public confession and that is an outfit obsessed 
ted_1161_0025560_0035360 i love finding wearing and more recently photographing and blogging a different colorful crazy outfit for everything all occasion 
ted_1161_0036050_0038310 but i don't buy anything new 
ted_1161_0038910_0053780 i get all my clothes second hand from flea market enter a store thank you for a second hand shopping allow me to reduce the impact my wardrobe have on the environment and on my wallet 
ted_1161_0054080_0064610 i get to meet all kinds of great people my dollar usually go to a good cause i look pretty unique and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt 
ted_1161_0064620_0066360 what am i gonna find today 
ted_1161_0066570_0067950 gonna be my thigh 
ted_1161_0068600_0068850 
ted_1161_0068900_0072040 what i liked the color will be under 
ted_1161_0072060_0076440 twenty dollars if all the answers are yes i feel as though 
ted_1161_0077340_0084220 i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i pack for this exciting week here at ted 
ted_1161_0084980_0087600 when somebody with all these outfits bring with her 
ted_1161_0087780_0090110 so i'm going to show you exactly what i abroad 
ted_1161_0091000_0096350 i brought seven pairs of underpants and that fit 
ted_1161_0097490_0102860 exactly one week's worth of unease is all i put in my suitcase 
ted_1161_0102890_0109740 he was betting that i'd be able to find everything else i could possibly want to wear once i got here to palm springs 
ted_1161_0110260_0117810 since you don't know me as the woman walking around in her underwear that means i found a few things 
ted_1161_0118200_0121470 i really love just show you my week's worth of outfits right now 
ted_1161_0121470_0134600 that don't get it and i'm also going to tell you a few the life lessons that believe it or not i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new 
ted_1161_0135010_0137120 let 's start with sunday 
ted_1161_0137860_0142910 so i called a shiny tiger you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great 
ted_1161_0142940_0146010 you can almost always looked phenomenal for under 
ted_1161_0146010_0153380 fifty dollars this whole outfit including the jacket cockney fifty five and it was the most expensive thing that i wore 
ted_1161_0153380_0156330 entire week monday color 
ted_1161_0157680_0170660 it 's almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red paint you are happy you're going to attract other happy people to you 
ted_1161_0171970_0176230 q day fitting in a way overrated 
ted_1161_0176880_0181670 i spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in 
ted_1161_0182130_0183890 adjust the who you are 
ted_1161_0184060_0190440 if you are surrounding yourself with the right people they will not only get it they will appreciate it 
ted_1161_0192080_0194800 wednesday embrace your inner child 
ted_1161_0195170_0202240 sometimes people tell me that i look like i'm playing dress up or that i remind them of their seven year old 
ted_1161_0203280_0206340 i like a smile and say thank you 
ted_1161_0207980_0210620 thursday competence is key 
ted_1161_0211180_0215380 if you think you look good in something you almost certainly do 
ted_1161_0215620_0219370 if you don't think you look good in something you're also probably right 
ted_1161_0219910_0222780 i grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out 
ted_1161_0223090_0227020 but it wasn't until i turned thirty i really got with this myth 
ted_1161_0227220_0229250 and i'm going to break it down for you for just a second 
ted_1161_0230640_0238500 if you believe you're a beautiful person inside and out there is no look that you can't pull off 
ted_1161_0238830_0241590 so there's no excuse for any of us here in this audience 
ted_1161_0241590_0245300 we should be able to rot anything we want to rock 
ted_1161_0245225_0245425 applause 
ted_1161_0249080_0256030 friday a universal truth five words for you gold sequins go with everything 
ted_1161_0257370_0267230 filing saturday developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word 
ted_1161_0267650_0275140 been proven time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i'm wearing and we've had great conversations 
ted_1161_0275520_0279410 so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase 
ted_1161_0279530_0283540 so before i go home to brooklyn i'm going to donate everything back 
ted_1161_0283700_0288500 because the lesson i'm trying to learn myself this week is that it's okay to let go 
ted_1161_0289030_0303370 i don't need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner there are always going to be another crazy colorful shiny outfit just waiting for me if i put a little love in my heart and look 
ted_1161_0304250_0305110 thank you very much 
ted_1161_0308995_0309195 
ted_1161_0309050_0309250 
ted_1165_0012370_0017990 in two thousand and seven i decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development 
ted_1165_0018550_0031980 our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents 
ted_1165_0033060_0035600 and now we're a long way away from that goal right now 
ted_1165_0035640_0041240 there are billions of people in developing countries who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them 
ted_1165_0041800_0047220 but the amazing thing about cities is they're worth so much more than it costs to build them 
ted_1165_0047900_0053050 so we could easily supply the world with dozens maybe hundreds of new cities 
ted_1165_0054010_0057980 this might sound preposterous to you if you've never thought about new cities 
ted_1165_0057980_0065080 but just substitute apartment building for cities imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren't there yet 
ted_1165_0065590_0071240 you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions and all the existing apartments 
ted_1165_0071620_0080020 but you know what you'd run into those apartments in the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction 
ted_1165_0080210_0082600 so it's extremely hard to do all those additions 
ted_1165_0082780_0092420 but you could go out someplace brand new build a brand new apartment building as long as the rules there were ones which facilitated construction rather than getting in the way 
ted_1165_0093280_0102410 so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name charter cities 
ted_1165_0103330_0110590 later i learned that about the same time javier and octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in honduras 
ted_1165_0111640_0123050 they knew that about seventy five thousand hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things 
ted_1165_0123060_0144360 ponderous at one point javier said octavio what if we took some of our empty land what do we just gave it to an embassy give some to the u s embassy give somebody to the canadian embassy and then if people want to go work under the rules of canada are the rules of the united states they could go get jobs do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to canada or the us 
ted_1165_0146490_0151110 summer two thousand and nine honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis 
ted_1165_0151630_0161930 the next regularly scheduled election pepe lobo one in a landslide on a platform that promised reform but reconciliation as well 
ted_1165_0162730_0165190 he asked octavio to be his chief of staff 
ted_1165_0166290_0169880 meanwhile i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal 
ted_1165_0170420_0180270 it through a process of refinement trial and error a lot of user testing i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials 
ted_1165_0182230_0188850 the first point was the importance of rules like those rules that say you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders 
ted_1165_0189340_0196780 we pay a lot of attention to new technologies but it takes technologies and rules to get progress and it's usually the rules that hold us back 
ted_1165_0198350_0203490 in the fall of two thousand and ten a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the ted 
ted_1165_0204590_0215750 he showed it to javier they called me they said let's present this to the to the leaders of our country so in december we met in miami in a hotel conference room 
ted_1165_0216630_0222390 i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are how much more valuable they are than they cost 
ted_1165_0222620_0232460 i use this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like new york city noticed land it's worth thousands of dollars in some cases per square meter 
ted_1165_0233740_0244130 but it was a fairly abstract discussion and at some point when there was a pause octavio said paul maybe we could watch that 
ted_1165_0244385_0244585 
ted_1165_0246950_0262010 so the tedtalk laid out in very simple terms a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in to go live under those rules or not 
ted_1165_0263620_0272870 so i was asked by the the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project this is important this could be the way forward for our country 
ted_1165_0273420_0277270 i was asked to come to tegucigalpa and talk again on january fourth and fifth 
ted_1165_0278380_0288780 so i presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this which tried to make the point that if you want to create a lot of value in a city it has to be very big 
ted_1165_0289170_0293460 this is a picture of denver and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver 
ted_1165_0293680_0297730 airport alone and covers more than one hundred square kilometers 
ted_1165_0298070_0304010 so i was trying to persuade the hundreds if you build a new city you've got to start with a site that's at least a thousand square 
ted_1165_0304010_0316000 kilometers that's more than two hundred and fifty one hundred thousand acres everybody applauded politely the faces in the audience were very serious 
ted_1165_0317280_0325320 the leader of the congress came up on stage and said professor romer thank you very much for a lecture but maybe we could watch that 
ted_1165_0326870_0332880 got it here on my laptop so i sat down and they played 
ted_1165_0333490_0338240 it got to the essence which is that a new city could offer new choices for people 
ted_1165_0338520_0344010 be a choice of a city you could go to which could be in honduras instead of hundreds of miles away in the north 
ted_1165_0344700_0346690 it also involved new choices for leaders 
ted_1165_0346730_0361180 because the leaders in the government there and honduras would need help from partner countries who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced 
ted_1165_0361550_0378280 the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement but i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust 
ted_1165_0379110_0380420 we went and looked at a site 
ted_1165_0380540_0381450 his pictures from there 
ted_1165_0381450_0384500 easily could hold one thousand square kilometers 
ted_1165_0385170_0394690 shortly thereafter on january nineteen they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions 
ted_1165_0395300_0403110 in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was one hundred and twenty four to one 
ted_1165_0404440_0407360 all parties all factions in society back this 
ted_1165_0407910_0410690 could be part of the constitution you actually have to pass it twice in congress 
ted_1165_0410690_0415130 in february seventeenth they passed it again with another vote of one hundred and fourteen to one 
ted_1165_0416330_0427600 immediately after that vote on february twenty twenty fourth the delegation of about thirty hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business 
ted_1165_0428290_0429490 one is south korea 
ted_1165_0429780_0435100 this is a picture of a big new city center this being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston 
ted_1165_0435390_0439910 if everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the permits 
ted_1165_0441190_0443860 the other place that's very interested in city building a singapore 
ted_1165_0443890_0447210 actually built to cities already in china and are preparing the third 
ted_1165_0448090_0451130 so if you think about this practically here's where we are 
ted_1165_0451650_0454530 it got a site there are already thinking about the site for the second city 
ted_1165_0455010_0466300 put in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in and also an external legal system one country is already volunteered to let its supreme court the quarter final appeal for the new judicial system there 
ted_1165_0466820_0469860 designers and builders of cities who are very interested 
ted_1165_0470180_0472240 dave and can bring with them some financing 
ted_1165_0472580_0476100 but the one thing you know that they've already solved is that there's lots of tenants 
ted_1165_0476450_0484100 there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas especially in a place where the free trade zone and there's lots of people who'd like to go there 
ted_1165_0484500_0489560 around the world there are seven hundred million people who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now 
ted_1165_0489860_0493290 a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states 
ted_1165_0493750_0502270 for many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to go to get enough money and even pay for food or clothing 
ted_1165_0502540_0509520 sadly sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven't seen in some cases for a decade 
ted_1165_0511390_0515620 so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city and honduras 
ted_1165_0515870_0519580 to build a dozen of these or one hundred of these around the world 
ted_1165_0519630_0528790 what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents 
ted_1165_0530310_0531750 is an idea worth spreading 
ted_1165_0532710_0536070 my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you ted 
ted_1165_0541835_0542035 
ted_1166_0012650_0022520 i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of nine hundred and seventy nine on the exact same day at the exact same moment each conceiving a baby 
ted_1166_0022980_0024970 so two couples each conceding one baby 
ted_1166_0024970_0032810 and i don't want you to spend too much time imagining that consumption because if you can imagine that consumption you're not going to listen to me though just imagine that for a moment 
ted_1166_0032850_0041150 in this scenario i want you to imagine that in one case the sperm is carrying a y chromosome meeting that x chromosome of the egg 
ted_1166_0041640_0046180 in the other case the sperm is carrying an x chromosome meeting the x chromosome of the egg 
ted_1166_0047120_0049210 both viable both take off 
ted_1166_0049840_0051100 will come back to these people later 
ted_1166_0051690_0055150 so i wear two hats in most of what i do 
ted_1166_0055900_0058890 the one hat i do history of anatomy 
ted_1166_0059130_0073660 historian by training and what i studied in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy meaning human bodies animal bodies how they dealt with bodily fluids concepts of bodies how they thought about bodies 
ted_1166_0073750_0083830 we hadn't had that i've worn in my work is as an activist as a patient advocate or i say as an impatient advocate for people who are patients or doctors 
ted_1166_0084240_0089440 in that case what i've worked with his people who have body types that challenge social norms 
ted_1166_0089880_0095450 some of what i've worked on for example is people who are conjoined twins two people within one body 
ted_1166_0096160_0100650 i worked on and people who have dwarfism so people who are much shorter than typical 
ted_1166_0101310_0109020 a lot of what i've worked on his people who have a typical sex so people who don't have the standard male or the standard female body types 
ted_1166_0109400_0112570 as a general term we can use the term intersects for this 
ted_1166_0113040_0115460 interests that comes in a lot of different forms 
ted_1166_0115530_0120770 so i'll just give you a few examples of the type of ways you can have sex than standard for male or female 
ted_1166_0121350_0133290 so in one in ten you can have somebody who has an x y chromosome will basin and that s why gene on the y chromosome test tells the proto gonads which we all have in the fetal life to become 
ted_1166_0133540_0136460 so in the fetal life those testes are pumping out testosterone 
ted_1166_0136760_0143850 but because this individual lack receptors to hear that testosterone the body doesn't react to the testosterone 
ted_1166_0143850_0150630 within her called androgen insensitivity syndrome so lock the levels of testosterone but no reaction to 
ted_1166_0150640_0154000 as a consequence the body develops more along the female typical path 
ted_1166_0154470_0156380 when the child is born she looks like a girl 
ted_1166_0156810_0159890 the girl she is raised as a girl 
ted_1166_0159890_0167740 often not until she hits puberty and she is growing and developing breasts but she's not getting her period that somebody figures that something's up here 
ted_1166_0168080_0174470 they do some tests and figure out that instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus she actually as testes inside and she has a y chromosome 
ted_1166_0175060_0179810 it was important to understand as you may think of this person is really being male but they're really not 
ted_1166_0180540_0185050 female like male have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands 
ted_1166_0185050_0186240 in the back of our body 
ted_1166_0186470_0189700 the adrenal glands make androgens which are a masculinizing hormone 
ted_1166_0190050_0199430 most females like me i believe myself to be a typical female i don't actually know my makeup and i think i'm probably typical most females like me are actually androgen sensitive 
ted_1166_0199440_0201970 we're making androgen and we're responding to androgens 
ted_1166_0202470_0210520 the consequences that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with androgen insensitivity syndrome 
ted_1166_0211150_0217660 in fact is really complicated it's not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the effects spectrum in some ways they can be all over the place 
ted_1166_0217980_0231670 another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was nineteen years old who was born a boy raised a boy had a girlfriend had sex with his girlfriend had a life is the guy and i just found out that he had ovaries and the uterus inside 
ted_1166_0232470_0236480 what he had with an extreme form of the condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia 
ted_1166_0236660_0246080 he had xx chromosomes and in the womb his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created essentially a masculine hormonal environment 
ted_1166_0246340_0251980 the consequences genitals were masculinzed his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones 
ted_1166_0252440_0255450 he was born a boy nobody suspected anything 
ted_1166_0255720_0265270 it was only when he had reached the age of nineteen that it began to have enough medical problems actually for menstruating internally that doctors figured out that in fact he was female internally 
ted_1166_0265930_0268780 so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersect 
ted_1166_0269570_0276600 some people who had xx chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it 
ted_1166_0277040_0278850 we are not exactly sure why that happened 
ted_1166_0279090_0281590 so thanks can come in lots of different varieties 
ted_1166_0282160_0297230 the reason that children with these kinds of bodies whether it's dwarfism or it can join twinning or and intersex type are often normalized by surgeons is not because they'd actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health 
ted_1166_0297620_0300030 in many cases people are actually perfectly healthy 
ted_1166_0300620_0306250 the ramp and they're often subject to various kinds of surgery because they threaten our social categories 
ted_1166_0306550_0312370 center has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity 
ted_1166_0312590_0322510 so we had a contract that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is allegedly to have an african anatomy in terms of your history 
ted_1166_0323140_0326620 we have a terribly simplistic idea 
ted_1166_0326930_0333230 when we're faced with a body that actually present that something quite different startled that in terms of those 
ted_1166_0334370_0338250 so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism 
ted_1166_0338300_0341260 and our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of 
ted_1166_0341880_0347230 one can imagine how startling then it is when you have children who are born who are two people inside of one body 
ted_1166_0348690_0358350 where i ran into the most kind of heat from this most recently with last year when the south african runner caster semenya had intersects called into question at the international games in berlin 
ted_1166_0358760_0370010 i 've had a lot of journalists calling asking me which is the tests are going to run that will tell us whether or not captures the many is male or female and i had to explain to the journalist there isn't such a test 
ted_1166_0370320_0384490 in fact we now know the effect is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn't draw the line for it between male and female or between male and intersex fino and intersects we actually draw that line on nature 
ted_1166_0385010_0400900 so what we have is a situation where the farther as time goes the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought it is stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fun than we thought 
ted_1166_0401390_0403220 not just in terms of sex 
ted_1166_0403330_0408960 also in terms of race which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed 
ted_1166_0409530_0412680 as we look we get into all sorts of sort of uncomfortable areas 
ted_1166_0412680_0418490 we look for example about the fact that we share at least ninety five percent of our dna with chimpanzees 
ted_1166_0418810_0423020 what are we to make of the fact that will differ from him only really by a few nucleus 
ted_1166_0424080_0433840 as we get farther and farther with our science we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we've had are probably overly simplistic 
ted_1166_0434650_0438280 so we're seeing it in all sorts of places in human life 
ted_1166_0438280_0445060 one of the point where we're seeing it for example in our culture today in the united states today is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life 
ted_1166_0445320_0452530 we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human such that it has a different right than a fetal life 
ted_1166_0453140_0460420 we have very difficult conversations nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine and that the question of when somebody debt 
ted_1166_0460700_0464770 pastor and thatcher had never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead 
ted_1166_0465160_0468730 both its take a feather and companies know that if a twitch they didn't bury them yet 
ted_1166_0468950_0471260 it had stopped twitching you bury them 
ted_1166_0471430_0477110 but today we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings 
ted_1166_0477400_0487780 the consequences were stuck with having struggled with is really difficult question about who's dead and this leads to a really difficult situation where we don't have pushed temple categories those we've had before 
ted_1166_0488190_0493470 you might think that all the breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy 
ted_1166_0493670_0498510 the political progress i defend people with unusual bodies but i have to admit that it makes me nervous 
ted_1166_0498900_0503860 understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me ten 
ted_1166_0504060_0506800 and it needs to be cancer in the point of view and thinking about democracy 
ted_1166_0507220_0512380 so in order to tell you about that tension that have to first admit that i'm a huge fan of the founding fathers 
ted_1166_0512680_0516030 i know they were racist i know they were sexes but they were great 
ted_1166_0516300_0528120 they were so brave bold and so radical in what they did that i find myself watching that she the musical seventy and seventy six every few years and it's not because of the music which is totally forgettable 
ted_1166_0528430_0531890 because of what happened in seventy and seventy six with the founding fathers 
ted_1166_0532470_0537750 the founding fathers were from my point of view the original anatomical activists and this is why 
ted_1166_0538480_0546190 what they rejected what an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for two hundred years 
ted_1166_0546670_0555480 so as you will recall what our founding fathers were rejecting with the concept of monarchy and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy 
ted_1166_0555560_0561040 monarch of the old world didn't have a concept of dna but they did not a cognitive birthright 
ted_1166_0561330_0562810 cognitive blue blood 
ted_1166_0563060_0573230 they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth 
ted_1166_0573910_0592760 the founding fathers rejected that idea and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept and that concept was all men are created equal they leveled the playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference in anatomy and that was a really radical thing to do 
ted_1166_0593540_0598600 they were doing it in part because they were part of an enlightenment system where two things were growing up together 
ted_1166_0599060_0604310 that was democracy growing up but it will go off and science growing up at the same time 
ted_1166_0604960_0611730 cleric you look at the history of the founding fathers a lot of them were very interested in science and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world 
ted_1166_0612010_0623110 we were moving away from supernatural explanations and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power were transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright 
ted_1166_0623460_0625590 we're moving towards a naturalistic concept 
ted_1166_0625770_0631390 look for example in the declaration of independence they talk about nature and nature's god 
ted_1166_0631600_0633650 if they don't talk about god and god's nature 
ted_1166_0633660_0637130 we 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are 
ted_1166_0637620_0643540 so as part of that they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality 
ted_1166_0643760_0648300 in doing so they were really standing up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement for the future 
ted_1166_0648510_0651400 they didn't think of it that way but they did it for us and it was great 
ted_1166_0651630_0653810 so what happened years afterwards 
ted_1166_0653810_0676300 what happened was women for example who wanted the right to vote took the founding fathers concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and that the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to me that we shouldn't have the right to vote the right to full citizenship the right to own property etc etc and women successfully argued that 
ted_1166_0676570_0695720 next came the successful civil rights movement where we found people like sojourner truth talking about a woman we find men on the the marching lines of the civil rights movement thing i am a man again people with color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy again successfully 
ted_1166_0695890_0698210 we see the same thing with a disability rights movement 
ted_1166_0699280_0706960 the problem is of course that as we begin to look at all that commonality we have to begin to question why do we maintain certain divisions 
ted_1166_0707660_0711540 i want to maintain some divisions anatomically in our culture 
ted_1166_0711730_0714970 for example i don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human 
ted_1166_0715480_0717840 i don't want to give up entirely on anatomy 
ted_1166_0717980_0721920 i don't want to think five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry 
ted_1166_0722340_0727510 so there are some anatomical divisions that makes sense to me and that i think we should retain 
ted_1166_0727730_0733170 but the challenge is trying to figure out which when they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning 
ted_1166_0733340_0736640 so let's go back to those two being conceived at the beginning of this talk 
ted_1166_0737090_0742270 we have to being conceived in the middle of nine hundred and seventy nine and the exact same day 
ted_1166_0742500_0747480 imagine one of them mary is born three month prematurely so she's born on june 
ted_1166_0749060_0752870 by contrast is born at term so he was born on march first nine hundred and eighty 
ted_1166_0753590_0766000 simply by virtue of the fact that mary was born prematurely three month she comes into all sorts of right three months earlier than henry does the right to confront in fact the right to vote the right to drink 
ted_1166_0766380_0772950 henry have to wait for all of that it's not because he was actually any difference in age biologically except in terms of when he was born 
ted_1166_0773990_0776730 we find other kinds of weird enough in terms of what their rights are 
ted_1166_0776890_0787560 henry by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven't told you that he's the x y one by the virtue of being assumed to be male it now liable to be drafted which married does not have to worry about 
ted_1166_0787970_0794350 meanwhile cannot in all the state kind of fame right that henry has been all the faith namely the right to marry 
ted_1166_0794670_0800620 henry can marry in every state a woman but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman 
ted_1166_0801300_0807680 so we have these anatomical categories look for things that are in many ways certain problematic unquestionable 
ted_1166_0807860_0822430 the question to me become what do we do as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy that we reached the point where we have to admit that a democracy and it's been based on anatomy might start falling apart 
ted_1166_0823870_0829280 i don't want to give up the science but at the same time a kind of feel sometimes like the fire was coming out from under us 
ted_1166_0829800_0830820 so where do we go 
ted_1166_0831800_0841560 theme like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude we have to draw the line somewhere so we will draw the line somewhere but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position 
ted_1166_0841680_0854510 so for example texters peasant one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don't have a y chromosome and what it means to marry woman means you do have a y chromosome now in practice they don't actually have people for their chromosomes 
ted_1166_0854710_0859460 but this is also very bizarre because of the story i told you that beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome 
ted_1166_0860880_0868650 we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy dr martin luther king he offers something of a solution in his i have a dream speech 
ted_1166_0868650_0875480 he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character moving beyond anatomy 
ted_1166_0875650_0879670 i want to say yeah that sounds like a really good idea but in practice how do you do 
ted_1166_0880320_0883200 how do you judge people based on the content of character 
ted_1166_0883800_0894900 i also want to point out that i'm not sure that is how we should distribute right in terms of humans because i have to admit their thumb golden retrievers but i know that are probably more deserving of social services and from yemen by now 
ted_1166_0895460_0904470 i want to say there are probably also even from yellow labrador that i know that are more capable of informed intelligent mature decisions about sexual relations and some forty year old that i now 
ted_1166_0904780_0909290 how do we operationalize the question of content of character 
ted_1166_0909290_0910880 it turns out to be really difficult 
ted_1166_0911140_0920530 part of me also wonders what are the content of character turns out to be something that's scannable in the future able to defeat with an mri 
ted_1166_0921030_0922490 we really want to go there 
ted_1166_0923090_0924310 i 'm not sure where we go 
ted_1166_0924450_0931840 what i do know is that it seems really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue democracy 
ted_1166_0931840_0936570 we've done a really good job struggling with democracy and i think we would do a good job in the future 
ted_1166_0936750_0947010 we don't have a situation that iran has for example where a man who sexually attracted to other men libel to be murdered unless he's willing to submit to effect change in which case he's allowed to live 
ted_1166_0947890_0949580 we don't have that kind of situation 
ted_1166_0949580_0959710 and i'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with a surgeon i talk to a few years ago who had brought over a third of conjoined twins in order to separate them partly to make a name for himself 
ted_1166_0960040_0970190 but when i was on the phone with them asking why he was going to do the surgery this is a very high risk surgery his answer was that it has other nation these children were going to be treated very badly and so he had to do this 
ted_1166_0970530_0984130 response humans will have you considered political asylum instead instead of separation surgery the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are without having them to have to be changed for the sake of the state 
ted_1166_0984800_0986380 so i think we have to be in the lead 
ted_1166_0986850_0991630 well just a close i want to suggest to you that i've been talking a lot about the fathers 
ted_1166_0991930_0998310 i want to think about the possibilities of what demography might look like or might have looked like if we had more involved the mothers 
ted_1166_0999370_1010220 why do something a little bit radical for a feminist and that is that i think that there may be different kinds of insight that can come from different kind of anatomies particularly when we have people thinking in groups 
ted_1166_1011560_1015570 for years because i've been interested in intersect they both have been interested in sex difference research 
ted_1166_1015840_1022650 one of the things i've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world 
ted_1166_1023210_1038740 and what we know from cross cultural studies is that female on average not everyone but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group 
ted_1166_1039550_1043130 so if we think about that we have an interesting situation 
ted_1166_1043490_1052130 for years ago when i was a graduate school one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism and considered myself a feminist as i still do after really strange question 
ted_1166_1052130_1057830 he said tell me what feminine about feminism and i thought let the dumbest question i've ever heard 
ted_1166_1057830_1067820 feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender so there's nothing feminine about feminism but the more i thought about this question the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism 
ted_1166_1068120_1082130 that aims to say there might be something on average different about female brain from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable 
ted_1166_1082150_1098300 so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept what we would have is more of a concept of not just how to protect but how to care for each other 
ted_1166_1098690_1109100 maybe that's where we need to go in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy is to think about the individual body in terms of the identity and think more about those relationships 
ted_1166_1109350_1115340 so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union were thinking about what we do for each other 
ted_1166_1115830_1116280 thank you 
ted_1166_1118195_1118395 applause 
ted_1171_0012830_0015540 as an artist connection is very important to me 
ted_1171_0016560_0024230 through my work i'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected 
ted_1171_0026190_0032230 i first went to antarctica almost ten years ago where i saw my first icebergs i was in awe 
ted_1171_0033290_0039780 my heart beat fast my head was dizzy trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me 
ted_1171_0039950_0051210 the icebergs around me were almost two hundred feet out of the water and i can only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake year after year 
ted_1171_0052840_0059360 icebergs are born when they can often glaciers or break off of ice shelves 
ted_1171_0062650_0065750 each iceberg has its own individual personality 
ted_1171_0066930_0072330 they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences 
ted_1171_0073160_0082230 some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion 
ted_1171_0084020_0092600 but it's easy to think when you look at an iceberg that they're isolated that their separate and alone much like we as humans sometimes you yourselves 
ted_1171_0093050_0094620 but the reality is far from it 
ted_1171_0095690_0100600 as an iceberg melts i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere 
ted_1171_0101810_0110040 the iceberg melts it is releasing mineral rich freshwater that nourishes many forms of life 
ted_1171_0112060_0123900 i approached photographing these icebergs as if i'm making portraits of my ancestors knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again 
ted_1171_0124640_0132780 it 's not a death when they melt it is not an end but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life 
ted_1171_0138450_0144240 some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young couple of thousand years old 
ted_1171_0144600_0147700 some of the ice is over one hundred thousand years 
ted_1171_0147700_0164100 fold the last pictures i'd like to show you are of an iceberg that i photographed in qeqetarsuaq 
ted_1171_0165350_0172690 a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling so here it is 
ted_1171_0173235_0173435 
ted_1171_0173330_0190720 can see on the left side a small boat it's about a fifteen foot boat and i'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline you can see here begins to roll and the boat is moved to the other side and the man is sending them 
ted_1171_0190950_0193410 is an average size greenlandic iceberg 
ted_1171_0193430_0198180 about one hundred and twenty feet above the water or forty meters 
ted_1171_0198310_0200210 this video is real time 
ted_1171_0207965_0208165 
ted_1171_0229990_0233800 and just like that the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality 
ted_1171_0236070_0236500 thank you 
ted_1176_0012990_0019700 what i do is write for children and probably america's most widely read children's author in fact 
ted_1176_0019700_0024360 i always tell people that i don't want to show up looking like a scientist 
ted_1176_0024560_0030320 so you can have me as a farmer or in leathers and no one has ever chose farmer 
ted_1176_0031510_0034490 here today to talk to you about circles and 
ted_1176_0035690_0039340 epiphany is usually something you find the drop zone place 
ted_1176_0039340_0042940 we 've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany 
ted_1176_0044040_0045480 a painting of a circle 
ted_1176_0045490_0048100 friend of mine yet that richard bollingbroke 
ted_1176_0048420_0051960 the kind of complicated circle then i'm going to tell you about 
ted_1176_0052560_0059520 circle began back in the sixties in high school and stow ohio where i was the class queer 
ted_1176_0059940_0067050 the guy beaten up bloody every week and the boys room until one teacher saved my life 
ted_1176_0067350_0073040 she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the boys in the teacher's lounge 
ted_1176_0073440_0076610 we did it in secret she did it for three years 
ted_1176_0076640_0079040 i had to get out of town 
ted_1176_0079530_0094070 i had a thumb i had eighty five dollars and i ended up in san francisco california metal lover and back in the eighties found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations 
ted_1176_0095220_0126190 about three or four years ago i got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher mrs postion who said i need to see you i am disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults could you please come to ohio and please bring that man that i know you have found by now and i should mention that i have pancreatic cancer and i'd like you to please a quick about this 
ted_1176_0127040_0129260 well the next day we were in cleveland 
ted_1176_0130030_0135780 we took a look at her we laugh cry and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice 
ted_1176_0136190_0145890 founder one week at are there and we took care of her and watched over her family because it was necessary if something we knew how to do 
ted_1176_0146570_0156730 just as a woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands 
ted_1176_0157480_0167960 what had happened was the circle closed it had become circle and that epiphany i talked about presented itself 
ted_1176_0168450_0171950 epiphany is that death is a part of fine 
ted_1176_0172240_0177540 she saved my life i and my partner saved hers 
ted_1176_0179160_0182950 that part of life need everything that the rest of life 
ted_1176_0182950_0187800 it needs truth and beauty and i'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today 
ted_1176_0188340_0198640 it also needs it needs dignity love and pleasure and it's our job to hand those things out 
ted_1176_0199450_0205120 cube 
ted_1176_0205045_0205245 applause 
ted_1328_0017110_0029540 in the nineteen eighties in the communist eastern germany if you own a typewriter you had to register it with the government 
ted_1328_0029930_0035150 to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter 
ted_1328_0035520_0040550 this was done so the government could track where textbooks coming from 
ted_1328_0040680_0049540 they found the paper which had wrong kinds of thoughts take that tracked down who created that thought 
ted_1328_0050960_0059660 we in the west couldn't understand how anybody could do this how much this would restrict freedom of speech 
ted_1328_0059730_0062740 we would never do that in our own countries 
ted_1328_0064980_0088900 but today in two thousand and eleven if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer 
ted_1328_0091000_0094030 what is happening to us today 
ted_1328_0096100_0099050 nobody seems to be making a fuss about 
ted_1328_0100270_0111620 this is an example of the ways that are wrong governments are using technology against us the citizens 
ted_1328_0113810_0117830 this is one of the main three sources of online problems today 
ted_1328_0118140_0124100 will look at what's really happening in the online world we can group the attacks based on the attackers 
ted_1328_0124700_0132110 we are three main groups we have online criminals like here we have to mr dimitry golubov from the city of keith in ukraine 
ted_1328_0133070_0137450 the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand 
ted_1328_0137460_0138800 these guys make money 
ted_1328_0139110_0144920 use online attacks to make lots of money and lots and lots of 
ted_1328_0145360_0152330 we actually have several cases of millionaires online multimillionaires who made money with their attacks 
ted_1328_0152410_0155560 and here's what chechen from the territory estonia 
ted_1328_0156010_0157690 alfred gonzalez 
ted_1328_0157870_0159110 steven ones 
ted_1328_0159690_0161390 viewers who d 
ted_1328_0161420_0165830 matthew anderson tariq al that were and so on and so on 
ted_1328_0166850_0186770 these guys make their fortunes online but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while they do online banking or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer 
ted_1328_0187860_0200500 secret service are two months ago froze the swiss bank account of mr some jane right here and that our bank accounts had fourteen point nine million us dollars on it when it's frozen 
ted_1328_0200870_0203800 mr jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is 
ted_1328_0205300_0216990 can i claim it's already today that it's more likely for any of us to become a victim of a crime online than here in the real world 
ted_1328_0218360_0221020 it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse 
ted_1328_0221050_0225310 in the future majority of crime will be happening online 
ted_1328_0228140_0233570 the second major group attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money 
ted_1328_0233790_0241820 motivated by something else motivated by protest motivated by an opinion motivated by the laughs 
ted_1328_0242320_0251500 groups like anonymous have risen up over the last twelve months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks 
ted_1328_0252960_0266670 so those are the three main attackers criminals to do it for the money hacktivists like autonomous doing it for the protests but then the last group our nation states governments doing the attacks 
ted_1328_0269250_0272630 look at cases like what happened it diginotar 
ted_1328_0272730_0277990 so this is a prime example of what happens when governments attacks against their own citizens 
ted_1328_0279040_0285570 did you know tar is a certificate authority from the netherlands are actually it was 
ted_1328_0285620_0292300 it was run into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into 
ted_1328_0292610_0295740 somebody broke into they acted thorough 
ted_1328_0297230_0315760 when i asked last week in a meeting with doug government representatives i asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the diginotar hack 
ted_1328_0318130_0320440 his answer was yes 
ted_1328_0322650_0326470 so how do people die as a result of a hack like this 
ted_1328_0327720_0332880 well diginotar is a c they sell certificates what do you do with certificates 
ted_1328_0333080_0343170 you need a certificate if he had a website that has https ssl encrypted services services like gmail 
ted_1328_0344010_0367900 we all are big part of us use gmail or one of their competitors but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services that they are encrypted over ssl connections to the local government can snoop on their discussions 
ted_1328_0368850_0373690 except they can if they hacked into a foreign ca at issue rogue certificates 
ted_1328_0374030_0377670 this is exactly what happened with the case of pigeon homes 
ted_1328_0377670_0385950 what about erupts arab spring and things have been happening for example in egypt 
ted_1328_0387160_0397440 in egypt the rioters looted the headquarters of the egypt secret police in april two thousand and eleven and whatever loading the building they found lots of papers 
ted_1328_0397650_0417700 some of those papers this binder kidal finfisher and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the erupt egypt governments a set of tools for intercepting and in very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country 
ted_1328_0418030_0422040 so this tool for two hundred and eighty thousand euros to the egypt 
ted_1328_0422050_0424990 government the company headquarters are right 
ted_1328_0425740_0432040 so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens 
ted_1328_0433800_0436590 western governments are doing it themselves as well 
ted_1328_0436810_0449530 for example in germany just a couple of weeks ago the so called starts trojan horse found which was a trojan used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens 
ted_1328_0449620_0455740 if you are the suspect in a criminal case well it's pretty obvious your phone will be tapped 
ted_1328_0455780_0458240 but today it goes beyond that 
ted_1328_0458260_0459880 they will tap your internet connection 
ted_1328_0459900_0474430 will even use tools like starts croton to infect your computer with a trojan which enables them to watch whole your communication to listen to your online discussions to collect your passwords 
ted_1328_0478460_0494970 what we think deeper about things like these the obvious response from people should be that okay well that sounds bad but that doesn't really affect me because i'm a legal citizen 
ted_1328_0495480_0496520 why should i worry 
ted_1328_0496550_0510100 because i have nothing to hide this is an argument which doesn't make sense privacy is implied privacy is not up for discussion 
ted_1328_0511190_0518940 it 's not a question between privacy against security 
ted_1328_0520360_0525160 it 's a question of freedom against control 
ted_1328_0526700_0536290 while we might trust our government right now right here in two thousand and eleven any writer we'd give away will be given away for good 
ted_1328_0536920_0544220 do we trust to be blindly trust any future government a government might have fifty years from now 
ted_1328_0548180_0552900 these are the questions that would have to worry about for the next fifty years 
ted_1330_0017460_0020070 know how many choices you make in a typical 
ted_1330_0020070_0020570 week 
ted_1330_0021860_0031100 but recently did a survey with over two thousand american and the average number of choices that the typical american report making is about seventy in a typical 
ted_1330_0031100_0038780 day it will also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole 
ted_1330_0039780_0047980 scientists simply documented all the various calf that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging and making decisions related to the cat 
ted_1330_0048910_0054320 they found that the average ceo engaged in about one hundred and thirty nine path than a week 
ted_1330_0054530_0058120 each task with made up of many many many many sub choices of course 
ted_1330_0058790_0062470 ninety percent of their decisions were made in one thousand nine minutes or less 
ted_1330_0064140_0069410 only about twelve percent of the decisions they make an hour or more of their time 
ted_1330_0070860_0072110 about your own choices 
ted_1330_0072710_0077590 if you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category 
ted_1330_0078540_0081860 how well do you think you're doing it managing those choices 
ted_1330_0083620_0089950 today i want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have which is the choice overload problem 
ted_1330_0090640_0093910 want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions 
ted_1330_0095010_0100230 they talk about this problem i'm going to have some questions for you and i'm going to want to know your answers 
ted_1330_0101350_0117040 so when i ask you a question since i'm blind only raise your hand if you want to burn off calories otherwise when i ask you a question and if your answer is yes i'd like you to clap your hands 
ted_1330_0117720_0126730 for my first question for you today are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem thank you 
ted_1330_0127690_0135580 when i was a graduate student at stanford university i used to go to a very very upscale grocery store and leaf at that time it was truly upscale 
ted_1330_0136250_0141340 store called breakers and the door and we don't look like going could amusement park 
ted_1330_0141450_0154320 they had two hundred and fifty different kinds of mustard and vinegars and over five hundred different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water and this is during a time when we actually used to drink tap water 
ted_1330_0155560_0162490 the love going to the store but on one occasion i asked myself how can we never buy anything 
ted_1330_0162800_0164020 their olive oil oil 
ted_1330_0164360_0171280 head over seventy five different kinds of olive oil including thought there were a lot case that came from a thousand year old olive trees 
ted_1330_0172300_0185030 i wanted to pay a visit to the manager and i asked the manager model of offering people oldest choice really working and he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up every day with cameras ready usually 
ted_1330_0185730_0190320 we need to do a little experiment and we picked jam for our experiment 
ted_1330_0190490_0191450 peering through jam 
ted_1330_0191460_0193860 we had three hundred and forty eight different kinds of jam 
ted_1330_0194230_0197830 we could have a little pasting booth right near the entrance of the store 
ted_1330_0198050_0210320 we put out six different flavors of jam or twenty four different flavors of jam and we look at two things first in which case when people more likely to stop ample some games 
ted_1330_0210890_0216600 people stop when they were twenty four about sixty percent than when there were thick about forty percent 
ted_1330_0217820_0223040 the next thing we looked at it in which case where people more likely to buy a jar of jam 
ted_1330_0223400_0225030 and now we see the opposite effect 
ted_1330_0225410_0230410 people who stopped when i was twenty four only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam 
ted_1330_0230810_0237840 the people who stopped when they were sick well now we thought that thirty percent of them actually bought a jar of jam 
ted_1330_0238260_0246190 if you do the math people were at least six times more likely to bought a jar of jam if they encountered thick than if they encountered twenty 
ted_1330_0247010_0258120 choosing not to buy a jar of jam is actually probably good for us at least it's good for our waistlines but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects the even in very consequential decisions 
ted_1330_0258190_0262770 we choose not to choose even when it goes against our best self interest 
ted_1330_0263520_0266390 for now for the topic of today financial savings 
ted_1330_0267150_0297280 study that i did with go home now i'm going to describe he was sedated with gore huberman amir communica way jang where we looked at the retirement savings decision of nearly a million americans from about six hundred and fifty plan all in the us and what we looked at whether the number of fun offering available in a retirement savings plan for one k plan does that affect people likelihood to save more for tomorrow 
ted_1330_0298140_0302070 what we found was that indeed there was a correlation 
ted_1330_0302270_0310480 so in these plants with about six hundred and fifty seven plan that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to fifty nine different fund offering 
ted_1330_0311080_0317220 what we found was that the more funds offered indeed there was left participation rate 
ted_1330_0317250_0326020 so if you look at the extreme those plans that offered you to fun participation rate for round in the mid seventies still a lot of times we want it to me 
ted_1330_0326880_0333770 those plans that offered merely thick the fun participation rate have now dropped to about sixty percent higher 
ted_1330_0335240_0345090 well it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present even then it has negative consequences 
ted_1330_0346150_0355010 so for those people who choose to participate the more choices available the more likely people were to completely avoid dr equity funds 
ted_1330_0355700_0360840 with more choices available the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market account 
ted_1330_0361250_0370390 neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you're considering their future financial well being 
ted_1330_0370970_0378340 well over the past decade we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices 
ted_1330_0379070_0383720 were more likely to delay choosing procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest 
ted_1330_0383950_0387620 more likely to make worse choices worse financial choices medical choices 
ted_1330_0388160_0394010 more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied even when they do objectively better 
ted_1330_0394510_0408580 the main reason for that is because well we might enjoy gazing at those giant wall the mayonnaise mustard vinegars jam fully can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting and actually taking from that stunning display 
ted_1330_0409750_0422250 what i want to propose to you today are for simple technique technique that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues that you can easily apply in your businesses 
ted_1330_0423300_0430790 for the first cut you heard it said before but it's never been more true than today that less is more 
ted_1330_0431780_0436810 people are always upset when i say cut they're always worried they're gonna lose shelf space 
ted_1330_0436880_0451100 but in fact what we're seeing more and more is that if you are willing to get rid of those extraneous redundant option well there's an increase in sales there's a lowering of costs there is an improvement of the choosing experience 
ted_1330_0451850_0469810 when proctor and gamble went from twenty different kinds of head and shoulders to fifteen they saw an increase in failed by ten percent when the golden can't corporation got rid of their ten worst filling cat litter product they saw an increase in profits by eighty seven percent a function of both the increase in sales and lowering of costs 
ted_1330_0469410_0473730 the average grocery store today offering to forty five thousand 
ted_1330_0473740_0476170 product the typical wal mart today offered 
ted_1330_0476410_0490370 in one thousand products but the nine the ninth largest retailer the biggest retailer in the world today is all these and it offers you only fourteen eight hundred products one kind of 
ted_1330_0490370_0504810 can tomato sauce now in the financial painting for i think one of the best example that has recently come out on how to manage the detroit offering has actually been something that david laibson with a heavily involved in designing which is a program that 
ted_1330_0504820_0509650 that harbored every single harvard employee is now automatically enrolled 
ted_1330_0509650_0516430 life cycle fund for those people who actually want to choose their given twenty fun not three hundred 
ted_1330_0516430_0520240 for more fun often people say i don't know 
ted_1330_0520240_0531000 how to cut their all important choices and the first thing i do is i asked the employees tell me how these choices are different from one another and if your employees can't tell them apart needed 
ted_1330_0531010_0537030 can you are consumers now before we started our session this afternoon 
ted_1330_0537030_0548140 cat with gary and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in the audience and all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road 
ted_1330_0548160_0551360 in the world and the description 
ted_1330_0551360_0554110 the road and i'd like you 
ted_1330_0554110_0560870 it read it and now i'm getting a few seconds to read it and i don't want you to clap your hands if you're ready to take carry up on his offer 
ted_1330_0562960_0590750 anybody who is ready to take him up on the offer that all all right let me do anything more about that you guys knew there was a trick in you now who are ready to go on a trip i think 
ted_1330_0591450_0605240 where have all right now in new had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around but i would venture to guess that you felt that it with more real 
ted_1330_0605240_0609710 second time around because the pictures made it feel more 
ted_1330_0609710_0615460 real to you which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem 
ted_1330_0615460_0630940 which is concretization that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice and let the consequences needs to be felt in a vivid sort of way 
ted_1330_0630940_0639670 a very concrete way why do people than an average of fifteen to thirty thirty percent more when they use an atm card and a credit card 
ted_1330_0639670_0641500 both the cash because it doesn't feel 
ted_1330_0641500_0649650 real money and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use and getting people 
ted_1330_0649650_0665580 nothing more to a study that i did with shlomi benartzi and alessandro fiba thorough we looked at we did a study with people and i envy employees that are all working and i n g and people were all in a fashion where they're doing enrollment for their 
ted_1330_0665580_0671680 coral one k plan and during a session we kept the fashion exactly the way it used to be but we added 
ted_1330_0671700_0682050 one little thing the one little thing we added with we asked people can just think that all the positive things that would happen in your life 
ted_1330_0682050_0695490 q saved more by doing that simple thing that was the increase in enrollment by twenty percent and there was an increase in the amount of people that were willing to save the amount that they're willing to put down into their savings account 
ted_1330_0695500_0698250 by four percent 
ted_1330_0698250_0703670 bird technique categorization you know we can handle more categories and 
ted_1330_0703670_0708220 can handle choices so for example here's the study we did 
ted_1330_0708220_0718500 and magazine aisle turned out that in wegmans grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor the magazine aisles range anywhere from three hundred and thirty one different kinds of magazines for all the way 
ted_1330_0718500_0720930 six hundred and sixty four 
ted_1330_0720930_0738880 what if i show you thick hundred magazines and i divide them up into ten categories burton's i show you four hundred magazines and divide them up into twenty category you believe that i have given new more joy and a better choosing experience if i gave you the four hundred than if i gave 
ted_1330_0738880_0742330 in the thick thundered because the category tell me how 
ted_1330_0742330_0746860 held them apart here are two 
ted_1330_0746860_0761180 and jewelry displayed one is called jazz and the other one is called swing if you think the display on the left to swing and the display on the right in jazz clap your hands 
ted_1330_0761460_0768000 if you think the one on the left and jazz in the one on the right is swing clap your hands 
ted_1330_0768180_0770200 a bit more ok now 
ted_1330_0770200_0774160 on your right the one on the left in chad and one on the right and swing 
ted_1330_0774810_0785070 the highly neutralist categorization scheme the category need to say something to the tunes are not 
ted_1330_0785170_0790560 with choice maker and you often see that problem when it comes down to that the long lived 
ted_1330_0790560_0793120 while these funds who are they actually supposed 
ted_1330_0793130_0796650 can be informing my fourth technique 
ted_1330_0796690_0806180 condition for complexity it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can we just had taken a little easier where that gradually 
ted_1330_0806210_0809590 increase the complexity i'm going to show you one example of what 
ted_1330_0809590_0813160 i'm talking about when to take a very very complicated decisions 
ted_1330_0813160_0818870 buying a car here in the german car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely customers 
ted_1330_0818870_0822790 make your car going to make sixty different decision completely making 
ted_1330_0822790_0826820 if your car now these decisions are very and the number of choices that 
ted_1330_0826860_0830350 offer decision car colors exterior car colored 
ted_1330_0830350_0832910 fifty six choices endgame 
ted_1330_0833170_0839410 partnership for choices so now what i'm going to do with i'm going to vary the order in which 
ted_1330_0839430_0845650 decisions appear to have to the customers are gonna go from high joy fifty six car colors to learn 
ted_1330_0845660_0853000 choice for gearshift the other half of the customers are going to go from low joy for gear ship than fifty thick art 
ted_1330_0853000_0855850 colors high choice what am i going 
ted_1330_0855850_0857480 and look at how 
ted_1330_0857510_0864050 and engaged you are if you keep hitting the default button per decision that means you're getting overwhelmed let me 
ted_1330_0864050_0877120 some luna knew what you find is the people that go from high choice to load choice they're hitting that the fault button over and over and over again we're losing them they go from below choice the high joy 
ted_1330_0877120_0878230 hanging in there 
ted_1330_0878250_0881140 the same information it's the same 
ted_1330_0881140_0886070 a number of choices the only thing that i have done and i have bearing the order in which that 
ted_1330_0886070_0890370 information is presented if i start you off easy i learned 
ted_1330_0890370_0899950 how to choose even though shooting gear shift doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor it feel prepared me for 
ted_1330_0899960_0905980 how to shoot it gets me excited about this thing product that i'm putting together a more willing can be motivated 
ted_1330_0905980_0924850 can be engaged so let me recap i have talked about for technique for mitigating the problem of choice overload cut get rid of the extraneous alternatives concretize make it real categorize we can handle more category less choices 
ted_1330_0925200_0938320 condition for complexity all of these techniques that i'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choice is better for you you can use them on yourself better for the people 
ted_1330_0938320_0944010 if you are serving because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to beat 
ted_1330_0944010_0951630 community about choosing and the more were able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice 
ted_1330_0951660_0953280 part of choosing 
ted_1330_0953210_0953410 applause 
ted_1337_0012800_0017680 we have to do something about the culture of peace of the culture of medicine that has to change 
ted_1337_0018220_0020620 it starts with one physician at me 
ted_1337_0020650_0026030 maybe i've been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to to do that 
ted_1337_0027080_0030600 before actually begin my talk let's begin with a bit of baseball 
ted_1337_0030880_0032260 why not 
ted_1337_0032650_0035440 near the end we're getting close to two into the world theory 
ted_1337_0035640_0043180 love baseball that way baseball is filled with some amazing statistics 
ted_1337_0043230_0051720 and i guess there's hundreds of moneyball that tend to come out all the statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team 
ted_1337_0052110_0056330 focus on the one that i hope a lot of the hurdle 
ted_1337_0056520_0057760 it 's called batting average 
ted_1337_0058290_0068210 so we talk about three hundred a battery that reminded that means that ballplayer batting can safely can safely three times out of ten at that 
ted_1337_0068770_0076530 hit the ball into the outfield dropped didn't get caught and whoever trying to throw to first base didn't get there in time and the runner estate 
ted_1337_0076940_0079880 it three times out of ten 
ted_1337_0080030_0084990 do you know what they call a three hundred here in major league baseball 
ted_1337_0086060_0090260 it really made an all star 
ted_1337_0091610_0095250 what they call a four hundred baseball hitter 
ted_1337_0095340_0098890 somebody hit by the way for a time to take me out of every kid 
ted_1337_0100150_0108340 legendary has been ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over four hundred during a regular season 
ted_1337_0109540_0116810 take this back into my world and medicine run a lot more comfortable or perhaps a bit less comfortable after one and planting them 
ted_1337_0118500_0130090 suppose you have appendicitis referred to a surgeon batting four hundred appendectomy somehow this isn't working out 
ted_1337_0130470_0146750 suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages into coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that local into a cardiologist who is bad and two hundred on angioplasties 
ted_1337_0147460_0148760 but you know what 
ted_1337_0148780_0155030 if she's doing a lot better this year she's on the comeback failed completely seven 
ted_1337_0155030_0156390 somehow this isn't working 
ted_1337_0156530_0165490 what i'm going to ask you a question what do you think of batting average or a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner aurora an orthopedic surgeon 
ted_1337_0165490_0171310 why have hermetic one thousand 
ted_1337_0171310_0181140 ok now truth in that nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedics proposed 
ted_1337_0182680_0188260 we do though is we send each one of them including myself out into the world with the admonition to be perfect 
ted_1337_0188270_0193290 never ever ever make a mistake but you worry about the details about how that's going to happen 
ted_1337_0194050_0197220 that was the methods that i absorbed when i was in school 
ted_1337_0197360_0200010 i was an obsessive compulsive students 
ted_1337_0200570_0209290 in high school classmate once said the prying open with stunning for a blood test and so i did 
ted_1337_0210630_0228580 i started my little garrett at the nurses resident attorney general hospital not far from here and i memorized everything i memorized in my anatomy class origins and assertions of muscle every branch of every artery that came off the aorta differential diagnosis obscure and common 
ted_1337_0228810_0233030 i even knew the differential diagnosis and how to classify renal tubular acidosis 
ted_1337_0233380_0236180 all the while loves imagine more and more knowledge 
ted_1337_0236620_0239540 well i graduated with honors come 
ted_1337_0240540_0253730 i cannot a medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything he knew everything or as much as possible as close to everything is possible that immunized against making mistakes 
ted_1337_0254950_0260510 it worked for a while until i met his drug 
ted_1337_0262460_0269140 was a resident at a teaching hospital here in toronto mrs drucker with broccoli emergency department of hospital where i was working 
ted_1337_0269600_0273540 at the time i was assigned to cardiologists or cardiology rotation 
ted_1337_0274080_0281700 it was my job when the emergency call for cardiology conflict that patient in emerge and to report back to my it can 
ted_1337_0282430_0285080 i saw mrs drucker and she was breathless 
ted_1337_0285080_0295710 and when i listened to her she was making a wheezy sound and when i listen to her chest with a stethoscope i can hear cracking down on both sides the told me that she was in congestive heart failure 
ted_1337_0296110_0305340 this is a condition in which the heart failure instead of being able to pump all look forward some of the blood backs up into the lung belongs to fill up with blood and that's why you have shortness of breath 
ted_1337_0306060_0308030 that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make 
ted_1337_0308030_0314330 it needed and i said we're treating aspirin with medications surely to strengthen your heart 
ted_1337_0314370_0320340 it gave her medications that we call diuretics water filled to get her natasha excess fluid 
ted_1337_0320850_0323940 over the course of the next hour and a half or two she started to build them 
ted_1337_0324960_0326020 i felt really good 
ted_1337_0327280_0332040 and that's when i need my first mistake i sent her home 
ted_1337_0333160_0335030 actually i need to more mistakes 
ted_1337_0335670_0338950 i sent her home without speaking to my intent 
ted_1337_0339760_0347550 i didn't pick up the phone and do what i'm supposed to do which is to call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance for himself 
ted_1337_0347670_0350850 he knew where he would have been able to furnish additional information about 
ted_1337_0352840_0354220 baby i did it for good reason 
ted_1337_0354820_0357300 maybe i didn't want to be a high maintenance residence 
ted_1337_0357330_0367020 i wanted to be so successful is so it will take responsibility fat that that i'm going to do so and i will be able to take care of my attending these patients without even having to contact 
ted_1337_0368540_0370520 second mistake that i made it worse 
ted_1337_0371920_0378980 sending her home i disregarded a little voice deep down inside i was trying to sell me goldman not a good idea 
ted_1337_0379190_0396680 in fact so lacking in confidence was that i've actually asked the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker do you think it is ok if she goes home and the nurse thought about it was very matter of factly yeah ok i can remember that like it was yesterday 
ted_1337_0397720_0402210 so i find the discharge papers and an ambulance came fairness can take her home 
ted_1337_0402770_0404210 i went back to my work on the world 
ted_1337_0406050_0414770 all the rest of that day that afternoon i had this kind of knowing feeling in my stomach but i carried on my work 
ted_1337_0414890_0424220 at the end of the day i packed up to leave the hospital and walk to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don't usually do 
ted_1337_0425420_0428010 walk through the emergency department on my way home 
ted_1337_0428940_0440850 it was there that another nurse not the nurse who was looking after mrs drucker the corporate another nurse three words to me that are the three words most emergency physicians i dread 
ted_1337_0441520_0447670 others in medicine dreaded as well but there's something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly 
ted_1337_0449390_0464050 with three words are do you remember you remember that patient you sent home the other nurse asked matter of factly she's back and just that 
ted_1337_0465120_0466260 pushing back all right 
ted_1337_0466660_0467760 back in the day 
ted_1337_0470260_0482740 about an hour after she had arrived home after i sent her home she collapsed and her family call nine one one on the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure and fifty which is in severe shock 
ted_1337_0483210_0485100 when she was barely breathing consumers blue 
ted_1337_0485330_0488340 emerged step pulled out all the stops 
ted_1337_0488770_0490820 even medications to raise blood pressure 
ted_1337_0491240_0493070 he put her on a ventilator 
ted_1337_0493660_0498480 i was shocked and shaking to the core 
ted_1337_0498950_0505980 i went through this roller coaster because after they stabilize her she went to the intensive care unit and i hoped against hope that she would recover 
ted_1337_0507070_0510500 over the next two or three days it was clear that she was never going to wake up 
ted_1337_0510710_0512340 versatile brain damage 
ted_1337_0514180_0520210 the family gathered over the course of the next eight or nine days a resigned herself to what was happening 
ted_1337_0520210_0529450 developed in one thousand eight mark they let her go mrs drucker away a mother and a grandmother 
ted_1337_0531150_0534260 they never forget the names of those who die 
ted_1337_0534280_0536810 that was my first time to be acquainted with that 
ted_1337_0538060_0555590 over the next few weeks i beat myself up and an experience for the first time the unhealthy shame and exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone isolated not feeling the healthy shaming should feel because you can't talk about it with your colleagues 
ted_1337_0555790_0571750 that healthy kind when you betray a secret that a best friend major promised never to reveal and you get busted and then you're here best friend confront you and you have terrible discussion at the end of it all that sick feeling guy and say you know i'll never made that mistake again 
ted_1337_0572210_0574340 community he never make that mistake again 
ted_1337_0574550_0577530 that kind of shame that being a teacher 
ted_1337_0578150_0582050 unhealthy shame i'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick and die 
ted_1337_0582500_0587800 the one that they're not that what you did with that but you are bad 
ted_1337_0588750_0591580 and it was what i was feeling 
ted_1337_0591850_0594540 and it wasn't because of my attending he was a dog 
ted_1337_0594540_0599000 he talked to the family and i'm quite sure who smoothed things over and made sure that i didn't get sued 
ted_1337_0600670_0603430 i kept asking myself this question 
ted_1337_0603430_0605310 why didn't i asked my attending 
ted_1337_0605400_0606620 why did i sent her home 
ted_1337_0606860_0611560 at my worst moment why why did i make stupid mistakes 
ted_1337_0611720_0612850 why did i go into medicine 
ted_1337_0613760_0616580 slowly but surely it lifted 
ted_1337_0617490_0618780 i began to feel a bit better 
ted_1337_0619140_0626990 and on a cloudy day there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered maybe i could feel better again 
ted_1337_0627190_0642800 i made myself a bargain you know that if only i redoubling my efforts to be correct and never make another mistake again please make the voices and they did and i went back to work 
ted_1337_0644440_0645330 then it happened again 
ted_1337_0646790_0654230 two years later lived in attending in the emergency department community hospital just north of toronto and i saw twenty five year old man with a sore throat 
ted_1337_0654240_0656210 bibby i was in a bit of a hurry 
ted_1337_0656580_0657720 egypt pointing here 
ted_1337_0658800_0660440 looked at a struggle a little bit paint 
ted_1337_0661200_0664310 and i gave him a prescription for penicillin data on his way 
ted_1337_0664890_0668100 even as he was walking in the door he was still sort of pointing to his throne 
ted_1337_0669400_0675850 two days later i came to do my next emergency shift and that's when my cheap asked to speak and he quietly in her office 
ted_1337_0676250_0688020 she said the three words do you remember you remember that patient who saw with a sore throat well it turns out he didn't have a strep throat 
ted_1337_0688030_0690750 he had a potentially life threatening condition called 
ted_1337_0692330_0698260 google it but if an infection not of the throat of the upper airway and it can actually have the clothes 
ted_1337_0699240_0701850 and unfortunately he didn't die 
ted_1337_0701870_0707640 he was placed an intravenous antibiotic and he recovered after day 
ted_1337_0707760_0719710 i went through the same period of shame and recrimination and felt cleansed and went back to work until it happened again and again and again 
ted_1337_0720750_0723720 twice in one emergency shit i missed appendicitis 
ted_1337_0724260_0730920 that takes some doing especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw about fourteen people at night 
ted_1337_0732150_0736880 in both cases i didn't send them home and i don't think there was any gap in their chairs 
ted_1337_0736900_0746780 one i thought had a kidney stone i ordered a kidney x ray were conducted a normal my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed and tenderness in the right lower quadrant called says 
ted_1337_0746840_0754620 the other one had a lot of diarrhea amniotic fluid to rehydrate him and asked my calling to reassess 
ted_1337_0754620_0758240 he did when he noticed and tenderness and the right lower quadrant 
ted_1337_0758790_0763110 both cases they have their operations and they did ok 
ted_1337_0763730_0766700 each time it would be 
ted_1337_0767360_0779260 i'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice many of my colleagues say which is totally as some of my doozies have been in the last five years 
ted_1337_0783290_0785830 alone machine and non support 
ted_1337_0786020_0799370 and here's the problem if i can't come clean and and talk about my mistakes if i can find the still small voice tells me what really happened how can i share with my colleagues 
ted_1337_0800290_0804540 how can i teach them what i did that they don't understand 
ted_1337_0806770_0810980 i will walk into a room right now until i have no idea what you think of me 
ted_1337_0811710_0815570 when was the last time you heard about somebody talk about daily rapper failure after failure 
ted_1337_0816240_0822850 you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other dr virginia twenty hear somebody talking about the wrong 
ted_1337_0823380_0840000 if i were to walk into a room filled with my colleagues and ask for their support right now and start to tell what i've just told you right now i probably wouldn't get him to those stories before they will start to get really uncomfortable somebody would crack a joke he changed the subject and when we move on 
ted_1337_0842440_0852890 that i and my colleagues one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the long leg in my hospital to lead the might have trouble making eye contact with that person 
ted_1337_0854080_0855590 the system that we have 
ted_1337_0855590_0857290 to complete denial of the state 
ted_1337_0858270_0875670 the system in which there are two kinds of good position those who make mistakes in those who don't those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can those who have lousy outcome those who have breakup 
ted_1337_0876470_0881670 and it's almost like an immunological reaction like the antibodies begin to attack that person 
ted_1337_0882410_0891050 and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine will only be left with but a statesman 
ted_1337_0892640_0894480 but there are two problems with that 
ted_1337_0895490_0914660 in my twenty years we saw a medical broadcasting in journalism i've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors and to learn everything i can't from one of the first article i wrote the toronto star to my show white coat black art and what i've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous 
ted_1337_0916420_0930600 we work in a system where errors happen every day one in ten medications right or wrong medication given in hospital where the wrong dosage for hospital acquired infections are getting more and more numerous causing havoc and 
ted_1337_0931770_0937170 in this country as many as twenty one thousand canadians die of preventable medical 
ted_1337_0937170_0940870 errors in the united states the institute of medicine pegged it 
ted_1337_0941020_0947230 in both cases these are gross underestimates because we really aren't ferreting out the problem 
ted_1337_0949250_0950950 and here's the thing 
ted_1337_0952140_0959440 hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years we can't keep up with it 
ted_1337_0959760_0962750 sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive 
ted_1337_0963020_0964210 we can't get rid of it 
ted_1337_0964760_0970010 we have our cognitive bias so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with with chest pain 
ted_1337_0970130_0977580 take the same patient with chest pain make them moist and careless and put a little bit of alcohol on a graph and suddenly my history laced with contempt 
ted_1337_0978380_0979910 the same history 
ted_1337_0980300_0983320 i 'm not a robot i don't do things the same way each time 
ted_1337_0983550_0990190 my patients on cars they don't tell me their symptoms in the same age time given all that mistakes are inevitable 
ted_1337_0990770_1001140 so if you take the system and i was taught and without all the error prone health professional well there will be any plane landed 
ted_1337_1003240_1010010 and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their their worst case 
ted_1337_1010550_1024740 show on white coat black are the habit of saying here's my worst mistake i would say to everybody from paramedics the cheek cardiac surgeon here's my worst mistake blah blah blah blah blah what about yours and i would point that my brooklyn toward man 
ted_1337_1025210_1033910 the pupils dilate pretrial than they would look down and swallow hard and started to tell stories 
ted_1337_1034500_1043500 want to tell their story they want to share their story they want to be able to say don't make a statement that i did what they need is an environment to be able to do that 
ted_1337_1043670_1047210 what they need is a really defined medical culture 
ted_1337_1047780_1050970 start with one position at a time 
ted_1337_1051300_1063230 redefined physician human no she's human except that isn't proud of making mistakes but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else 
ted_1337_1063910_1065930 she shares her experience without it 
ted_1337_1065940_1068550 supportive when other people talk about their mistakes 
ted_1337_1069190_1076520 she points out other people's mistakes not in a gotcha way but in a loving supportive way so that everybody can benefit 
ted_1337_1077420_1086470 she works in a culture of that and that acknowledges that human beings run the system and when human beings run them they will make your pension plan decline 
ted_1337_1086810_1117630 so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes the human inevitably mate and also fosters loving supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the healthcare system can actually point out things they could be potential mistakes in is rewarded for doing so and especially people like me when we do make mistakes were rewarded for coming clean 
ted_1337_1119340_1120660 findings brian goldman 
ted_1337_1122390_1133310 redefined physician i'm human i make mistakes story about that but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people 
ted_1337_1134880_1138330 i still don't know what you think of me but i can live with 
ted_1337_1139790_1145600 let me close with three words of my own i do 
ted_1346_0013760_0042360 because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be and i thought that since i was among friends here i will tell you what i really think on and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with his amazing jumps and technology that seemed so fast that we can we can barely keep on others 
ted_1346_0042810_0051120 so i'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology fly and then if you can just turn on the fly the fun 
ted_1346_0053520_0057480 this is just a random slide that i'd picked out of my file 
ted_1346_0057940_0061990 when i want to show you is not so much the detail from this line but the general form of 
ted_1346_0062000_0070470 what happens to be a slider from analysis that we were doing about the power of risc microprocessors versus the power of local area network 
ted_1346_0071320_0082160 the interesting thing about it is that this slide like so many technologies like that were used to sort of a straight line on a semi log curve 
ted_1346_0083170_0087700 in other words every step here represents an order of magnitude and performance can 
ted_1346_0088640_0094160 and we're sort of a new thing that we talk about technology on semi log curve 
ted_1346_0094720_0096650 something really weird going on here 
ted_1346_0097050_0098980 basically what i'm going to be talking about 
ted_1346_0099170_0100420 so if you bring up the lights 
ted_1346_0100430_0107850 i think bring up the light higher because i'm just going to use a piece of paper here 
ted_1346_0109090_0112830 why do we draw technology curves and from the long term 
ted_1346_0113290_0134340 the answer is that if i do it on a normal curve let's say this year's time of some sort and this is whatever measure of the technology that i'm trying to grab the grasslands silly go like this and they don't tell us much 
ted_1346_0135600_0144660 if i graham for instance some other technologies a transportation technology on a semi log curve it would look very stiff but it would look like a flat line 
ted_1346_0144670_0148840 when something like this happen anywhere qualitatively changing 
ted_1346_0148860_0160060 transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology are then day after tomorrow i would be able to get in a taxicab and be in tokyo in thirty seconds 
ted_1346_0161360_0162450 movement like that 
ted_1346_0162460_0170660 nothing president in the history of technology development of this kind of self healing growth where you've got by orders of magnitude every year 
ted_1346_0171910_0179360 the question that i ask if you look at these exponential curve go on forever 
ted_1346_0181200_0185000 he just can't possibly keep changing fast fulfill 
ted_1346_0185540_0187210 one of two things are going to happen 
ted_1346_0188100_0198450 whether it's going to turn into a classical ask her death until something totally different comes along or maybe it's going to do 
ted_1346_0199470_0200780 about all i can do 
ted_1346_0201270_0205560 but i'm an optimist i think it's probably going to do something like that 
ted_1346_0206210_0210610 so that means that what we're in the middle of right now is a transition 
ted_1346_0210640_0217570 we 're sort of unknown line in a transition from the way that the world used to be to some new way that the world 
ted_1346_0217740_0223260 so what i'm trying to have been asking myself what's this new way that the world 
ted_1346_0223290_0225510 the new state of the world was heading towards 
ted_1346_0226110_0230480 because the transition seems very very confusing and we're right in the middle of it 
ted_1346_0231630_0241640 when i was a kid growing up the future was kind of the year two thousand and people used to talk about what will happen in the year two thousand 
ted_1346_0241790_0248170 now here's a conference in which people talk about the future and you'll notice that the future is still in about a year 
ted_1346_0248720_0250020 about four as we go out 
ted_1346_0250750_0258140 in other words the future has been shrinking one year per year or my whole lifetime 
ted_1346_0260140_0267530 and i think the reason is because we all feel that this humbling happening there that transition has happened since 
ted_1346_0267950_0278090 we know that it just doesn't make too much sense to think out thirty fifty years because everything is so different than a simple extrapolation of what we're doing just doesn't make any sense at all 
ted_1346_0279500_0284980 so what i would like to talk about what that could be what that transition from that we're going through 
ted_1346_0286580_0295180 in order to do that i'm going to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers 
ted_1346_0295220_0300950 because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things 
ted_1346_0301570_0307510 so the time scale that i would like to look at this on the timescale of life on earth 
ted_1346_0307830_0314970 so i think that this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time 
ted_1346_0316690_0325020 so if you go back about two and a half billion years the earth was this big sterile chunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around 
ted_1346_0327190_0332640 if you look at the weight of the chemicals can organize we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do 
ted_1346_0334310_0348580 i think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with ornate i'm going to tell a simple story of when she is that at that time there were a little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them 
ted_1346_0349700_0358680 some of those groups of oils had a particular combination of chemicals in them which causes them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil 
ted_1346_0359550_0363000 and those that were like that started to split and divide 
ted_1346_0363630_0367580 and those were the most primitive forms of cells and visible drops of oil 
ted_1346_0368550_0375000 but now those drops of oil weren't really live as we have now because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals 
ted_1346_0375440_0382330 every time it divided something different and got on equal division of the chemicals with 
ted_1346_0382900_0384710 and so every drop of a little bit different 
ted_1346_0385430_0394380 in fact it robs that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them grew more incorporated more chemicals and divided more 
ted_1346_0394780_0397940 so those tended to live longer get expressed more 
ted_1346_0399440_0411260 that sort of just a very simple chemical form of life when things got interesting was when withdrawn learn of a trick of abstraction 
ted_1346_0412360_0418930 somehow ways we don't quite understand drops learned to write down information 
ted_1346_0419000_0425390 blender record the information that was the recipe of the fell onto a particular kind of chemical called 
ted_1346_0426550_0437180 so in other words they worked out in a sort of mine was revolutionary way a form of writing that let them write down what they were so that that way of writing it down could get caught 
ted_1346_0438210_0444570 the amazing thing is that there were writing seems to have stayed there is some sort of all two and a half billion years ago 
ted_1346_0444920_0449790 in fact the recipe for us our genes is exactly that same code in that same way of right 
ted_1346_0450260_0455600 in fact every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters in the sun 
ted_1346_0456180_0461060 one of the things that i did just for amusement purposes as we can now write things in this case 
ted_1346_0461790_0485760 and i'm not here a little hundred micrograms of flight counter which i try not to let the security people see at airports but this has entered one identify took this coat the code has standard letters that we used for symbolizing it and i wrote my business card under a piece of dna and amplify the end of the twenty two times 
ted_1346_0486580_0508040 so if anyone would like one hundred million copies of my business card i have plenty for everyone in the room and back to everyone in the world and it's right here so i really been an egotist i would have put it into a virus and released it in the room 
ted_1346_0509535_0509735 
ted_1346_0516200_0517900 so what was the next step 
ted_1346_0517900_0519940 writing down the dna was an interesting stuff 
ted_1346_0520900_0524380 currently sells so i kept them happy for another billion years 
ted_1346_0524890_0534920 then there was a really interesting stuff where things and completely different which is the show started exchanging and communicating information so that began communities themselves 
ted_1346_0535320_0538020 if you notice that bacteria can actual exchange 
ted_1346_0538350_0541710 and that's why for instance antibiotic resistance 
ted_1346_0542320_0554800 some bacteria figured out how to stay away from someone and it went around sort of creating its own dna information with other bacteria and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin accurate and communicate 
ted_1346_0555830_0563020 what this communication allowed was communities to form that assumptions were in the same boat together and they were synergistic 
ted_1346_0564440_0575670 they survived or fail together we can be used for the community was very successful only individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution 
ted_1346_0576890_0587940 the transition point when he's got so close that actually got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one strength 
ted_1346_0588930_0592630 the next stage of interesting and lived about another billion years 
ted_1346_0593090_0600870 and at that stage multicellular communities communities have lots of different types of cells working together as a single one 
ted_1346_0601150_0603600 in fact we're such a multi cellular community 
ted_1346_0603610_0607450 and lots of cells that are not out for themselves and him 
ted_1346_0607450_0614080 for your skin cell is really useless without heart cell muscle cell and brain cell phone 
ted_1346_0614860_0623840 so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell for the community which we call an organism 
ted_1346_0625650_0629580 the next step and happen within the community 
ted_1346_0629840_0638550 communities themselves again began to extract information and then again building very special structures that did nothing but process information with them 
ted_1346_0639650_0641090 closer the neural structure 
ted_1346_0641100_0646400 so neurons with the information processing apparatus for those communities themselves felt 
ted_1346_0647420_0656620 in fact they began to get specialists and the community and special structures that were responsible for recording understand the learning information 
ted_1346_0656630_0660260 it was the brain from the nervous system of others community 
ted_1346_0660800_0662960 and gave them an evolutionary advantage 
ted_1346_0662990_0674660 because at that point an individual things learning could happen within the time span of a single organism instead of over evolutionary time span 
ted_1346_0675250_0682230 so an organism could for instance learn not to eat a certain kind of proof because of their knickers sinclair 
ted_1346_0683290_0698530 that could happen within the premise of a single organism whereas before they build those special information processing structures that would have to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by by the individuals dying off that kind of cruel 
ted_1346_0699180_0706590 so that nervous system built was special information structures tremendously heated up the whole process of evolution 
ted_1346_0706980_0709890 evolution could now happen within an individual 
ted_1346_0710080_0711700 learning time 
ted_1346_0713050_0717410 then what happened with the individual worked out of course tricks of communicating 
ted_1346_0718760_0723310 for example all the most sophisticated version that we're aware of this human language 
ted_1346_0723810_0726630 it 's really a pretty amazing invention to think about 
ted_1346_0726660_0731010 i have a very complicated and messy confused idea in my head 
ted_1346_0731470_0739190 and i'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically and hopefully constructing a similar method confused idea your head that there's some analogy to 
ted_1346_0739980_0746970 tell you something very complicated and turning it into sound sequence of sound and producing something very complicated in your brain 
ted_1346_0748140_0754090 so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism 
ted_1346_0755520_0762500 so in fact what we've done is we have started abstracting out 
ted_1346_0762510_0771070 we're going through the same level of multicellular organisms have gone through and extracting out residents of recording presenting processing information 
ted_1346_0771860_0775580 so for example the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction 
ted_1346_0777740_0787380 computer video to cd rom so on are all are specialized mechanisms that we've now built within our society for handling that information 
ted_1346_0788140_0799850 all connect together into something that is much bigger and much faster unable to evolve than what we were before 
ted_1346_0800450_0803290 so now evolution can take place on the scale 
ted_1346_0804220_0811500 highs little evolutionary example where he did a little bit of evolution of convolution program right before your eyes 
ted_1346_0811940_0814250 so now we speed it up the time scales once again 
ted_1346_0814250_0818110 for the first steps and the story that i told you about a billion years of tea 
ted_1346_0818520_0824110 the next steps like like nervous systems and brains took a few hundred million years 
ted_1346_0824580_0828840 when the next steps like language and so on but less than a million 
ted_1346_0829220_0832920 next like electronics seems to be taking only a few decades 
ted_1346_0833290_0841720 in the process is feeding on itself and the company autocad linux and work on something reinforces its rate of change 
ted_1346_0841760_0843600 furthermore it changes the search engine 
ted_1346_0843600_0847520 i think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion occurred 
ted_1346_0847520_0849680 we're seeing this process feeling back on itself 
ted_1346_0850660_0862480 i designed computers for a living and i know that mechanisms that i do find computer would be impossible without recent advances in computer 
ted_1346_0863210_0870750 so right now when i do as i design objects of such complexity that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense 
ted_1346_0870750_0873580 i don't know what every transistor and the connection she thought 
ted_1346_0874390_0875640 there are billions of dollars 
ted_1346_0876730_0890660 instead what i do and what the designers thinking machines do we think at some level of abstraction and then handed to the machine and a machine takes a neon but we could ever do much farther and faster than we could ever 
ted_1346_0891240_0895130 and in fact sometimes it takes a method that we don't even understand 
ted_1346_0896130_0902610 one method is particularly interesting that i've been using a lot lately evolution itself 
ted_1346_0903650_0911160 so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time 
ted_1346_0912060_0920480 so for example in the most extreme cases we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instruction 
ted_1346_0922070_0936720 same computer would you please make one hundred million random sequences of instructions now would you please ran all those random sequences and instructions run all of us program and pick out the ones that can cause us to do what i want and in other words i define what i want 
ted_1346_0936720_0939500 i want to sort numbers it's a simple example on them 
ted_1346_0940260_0943340 find the programs that come closer to shore numbers 
ted_1346_0944060_0950180 so of course random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers so none of them will relate to 
ted_1346_0950180_0954080 one of them by luck may for two numbers in the right order 
ted_1346_0954920_0963170 the computer would you please take the ten percent of those random sequences that did the best job save those kill off the rails 
ted_1346_0963870_0980530 now let's reproduce the ones that sort of numbers that unless reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to facts and take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their sub routine and the children inherit the traits subverted to program 
ted_1346_0981220_0987500 so i got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs within a little bit better job 
ted_1346_0987970_0991420 so please repeat that process score of them again 
ted_1346_0991480_0995960 introduced mutations perhaps and try that again for another generation 
ted_1346_0996340_0999470 for every one of us generations just takes a few milliseconds 
ted_1346_1000280_1008540 so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer and a few minutes from the complicated cases from a few hours 
ted_1346_1009100_1013490 by the end of that i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect sorting numbers 
ted_1346_1013920_1018430 in fact there are programs that are much more efficient than programs i have ever written by hand 
ted_1346_1019200_1022340 if i look at those program i can't tell you how they work 
ted_1346_1022380_1024350 try looking at them and tell you how they work 
ted_1346_1024370_1026330 obscure weird programs 
ted_1346_1027330_1028610 but they did it in a job 
ted_1346_1028850_1035440 in fact i know i'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job 
ted_1346_1035730_1037700 their life depended on doing the job 
ted_1346_1044500_1044700 
ted_1346_1044850_1059730 it was running at seven forty seven with marvin minsky once and others card and said oh look look at this and says this plan has hundreds and thousands of tiny parts working together to make you are safe flight doesn't make it happen 
ted_1346_1059690_1059890 
ted_1346_1062410_1066510 in fact we now that the engineering process doesn't work very well when it gets 
ted_1346_1067320_1073460 so we're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that's different than the engineering 
ted_1346_1073950_1078660 as for new things are much more funny than normal engineering lenses for 
ted_1346_1079170_1081400 and yet we don't quite understand the king said 
ted_1346_1081430_1083100 so in a sense it's getting ahead 
ted_1346_1083930_1090390 we are now using those programs to make much faster computers and it will be able to run this process much faster 
ted_1346_1090910_1092490 feeding back on itself 
ted_1346_1093320_1097410 but thank you for coming faster and that's why i think it seems so confusing 
ted_1346_1097410_1100180 all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves 
ted_1346_1100860_1101840 were taking off 
ted_1346_1102370_1109580 but we are at a point in time which is analogous to win single celled organisms were running and so on 
ted_1346_1110210_1114890 where the amoebas and we can figure out what the hell the thing is were created 
ted_1346_1115000_1116560 we're right at that point of transition 
ted_1346_1117540_1121040 but i think that there really is something coming along after all 
ted_1346_1121040_1124960 but i think it's very audi of us to think that early in life and evolution 
ted_1346_1125600_1130450 i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing 
ted_1346_1131640_1137660 so lunches coming along and i think i will stop at that point before i get selected out 
ted_1346_1144435_1144635 
ted_1353_0016890_0023160 for instant photography because of course this is a photograph that you can take with camera 
ted_1353_0024190_0029010 my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of fifteen 
ted_1353_0030540_0038840 mixed with my earlier passion for drawing but it was a bit different because using the camera the process was in the planning instead 
ted_1353_0039190_0045290 when you take the photograph with a camera it's just the process ends when you press the trigger 
ted_1353_0046220_0051060 so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place at the right time 
ted_1353_0052130_0053990 i felt like anyone could do that 
ted_1353_0054960_0060900 so i wanted to create something different something were to process starts when you press the trigger 
ted_1353_0062510_0069100 photos like this construction going on along a road but it has an unexpected twist 
ted_1353_0069620_0072570 despite that entertains the level of reality 
ted_1353_0072540_0083130 photos like teeth both dark and colorful but all with a common goal of retaining the level of rio 
ted_1353_0084980_0087570 when a study released i mean photoreal 
ted_1353_0087760_0097400 because of course it's not something you can capture it really but i always wanted to look like it could have been captured some are as a photograph 
ted_1353_0098190_0102390 photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out to trick 
ted_1353_0103470_0107170 so it's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really 
ted_1353_0109150_0112360 but what the trick that makes it look realistic 
ted_1353_0113370_0115760 something about a tenth or the colors 
ted_1353_0116800_0118270 something about the light 
ted_1353_0119670_0121190 what creates the illusion 
ted_1353_0123440_0126050 sometimes the perspective is the illusion 
ted_1353_0126940_0132270 but in the end it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be relies on a two dimensional surface 
ted_1353_0133440_0138530 it 's not really what israelis tickets it's how we what we think looks realistic really 
ted_1353_0139230_0141700 so i think the basics are quite simple 
ted_1353_0142930_0150220 teeth as possible of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create an alternate reality 
ted_1353_0151680_0153020 and let me show you a simple example 
ted_1353_0154870_0161320 here we have three perfectly imaginable physical object something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world 
ted_1353_0162260_0169590 but combined in a certain way they can create something that looks three dimensional like it could exist 
ted_1353_0170940_0173100 but at the same time we know it can't 
ted_1353_0173750_0178770 so we take our brains because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make sense 
ted_1353_0179850_0184160 i think the same process with combining photographs 
ted_1353_0184980_0187690 it 's just really about combining different realities 
ted_1353_0189280_0199130 so the things that make a photograph look realistic i think it's the things that we don't even think about the things all around us and our daily lives 
ted_1353_0200600_0207120 but when combining photographs this is really important to consider because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow 
ted_1353_0208600_0213240 so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result 
ted_1353_0215240_0217180 as you can see these images aren't really special 
ted_1353_0217750_0220930 but combined they can create something like this 
ted_1353_0224110_0227770 so the first rule is the photos combined should have the same perspective 
ted_1353_0229070_0232880 secondly photos combined should have the same type of light 
ted_1353_0233960_0239380 these two images both fulfill these two requirements shocked at the same height and in the same type of light 
ted_1353_0240820_0248200 the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish were different images begin and end by making it seamless 
ted_1353_0249360_0252510 make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed 
ted_1353_0253910_0275720 so by matching color contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images adding photographic defects like depth of field desaturated colors and noise race the borders between the different images make it look like one single image despite the fact that one in which can contain hundreds of layers 
ted_1353_0277180_0287220 so here's another example one might think that is just an image of a landscape and the lower parts such manipulated 
ted_1353_0288260_0293210 but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations 
ted_1353_0294400_0302400 i personally think that it's easier to actually create a place them to find a place because then you don't need to compromise with ideas in your head 
ted_1353_0303450_0305970 but it does require a lot of planning 
ted_1353_0307180_0314150 and getting this idea during winter i knew that i had several months to planet to find a different locations for the pieces for the puzzle basically 
ted_1353_0315460_0318620 so for example the fish is captured on a fishing trip 
ted_1353_0320200_0322100 shores are from a different location 
ted_1353_0322160_0324290 underwater part is captured in stone 
ted_1353_0325120_0329730 yeah even turn the house on top of the island ready to make it look more swedish 
ted_1353_0331060_0335110 so to achieve a realistic result i think it comes down to planning 
ted_1353_0336360_0338850 it always starts with a sketch an idea 
ted_1353_0340380_0342830 when it's about combining different photographs 
ted_1353_0343970_0346540 and here every piece is very well planned 
ted_1353_0346790_0353510 if you do a good job capturing the photos result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic 
ted_1353_0355290_0364350 so all the tools are out there and the only thing that limits us is our imagination 
ted_1353_0367230_0367550 
ted_1353_0370905_0371105 applause 
ted_1359_0012350_0016110 i would love to talk to you about why many iaaf projects failed 
ted_1359_0016900_0021800 i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients 
ted_1359_0022590_0026550 one of the things we did at rutgers university reappointed achieve listening officer 
ted_1359_0026670_0035220 not on a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea and ask patients family relatives what's up 
ted_1359_0035560_0045950 how could we hope you and we think we like to think that this is one of the major problems why all maybe not all but most of the iaaf project shrill since we stopped listening 
ted_1359_0047220_0048370 my weight scale 
ted_1359_0048900_0049840 it 's a very simple thing 
ted_1359_0049840_0051880 it got one not on off 
ted_1359_0052050_0054030 and every morning i hope on it 
ted_1359_0054870_0057620 yes i've got a challenge as you might see 
ted_1359_0058610_0061260 and i quit my challenge or ninety five kilograms 
ted_1359_0061620_0068190 but the thing is that it's made this simple that whenever i hop on its sense my data to google health as well 
ted_1359_0069310_0082610 and it's collected by my general petitioner as well so he can see what my problem in weight not on the very moment that i need cardiologic support us in something like it but also looking backward 
ted_1359_0083570_0084520 but there's another thing 
ted_1359_0084930_0088580 some of you might know i got more than four thousand followers on twitter 
ted_1359_0088630_0096850 so every morning i hope on my weighing scale and before i'm in my car people start talking to me i think you need a light lunch today 
ted_1359_0097485_0097685 
ted_1359_0098540_0110300 but that's the nicest thing that could happen since this is peer pressure peer pressure used to help patients since this could be useful at least as it could be used to stop smoking 
ted_1359_0110340_0122020 for patients but on the other hand it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health 
ted_1359_0122660_0129930 next week it will be soon available there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone over something or other 
ted_1359_0130610_0140890 people will be able from their homes to take their blood pressure scented into the doctor and eventually share it to others for instance for over one hundred dollars 
ted_1359_0141280_0163410 this is the point where patients get into position and can collect not only their own control again the captain of the ship but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face like health care costs explosion doubled the amount of things like that make techniques that it's easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in a team 
ted_1359_0163860_0167390 you could do this with techniques like this but also by crowdsource 
ted_1359_0168090_0172570 one of the things we did i would like to share with you and reduced by a little video 
ted_1359_0245220_0247510 forgotten navigation controls in our car 
ted_1359_0247720_0249440 we may be even got it in a cell phone 
ted_1359_0250380_0254190 we perfectly nowhere all day atms are just about the city of mastery 
ted_1359_0254780_0256860 the other thing is we know where all the gas stations 
ted_1359_0257790_0259990 ensure we could find fast food chains 
ted_1359_0260850_0264740 but where would be the nearest eighty to help this patient 
ted_1359_0265040_0266640 we asked around and nobody knew 
ted_1359_0267640_0271930 nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving id wants to obtain right now 
ted_1359_0272670_0274850 so what we did we crowdsource the netherlands 
ted_1359_0275200_0285400 we set up a website and asked the crowd if you see an eddy please submit it tell us where it is challenged when it's open since sometimes in office hours at the close of course 
ted_1359_0285970_0288830 over ten thousand babies in the netherlands already have 
ted_1359_0288830_0292370 submitted the next time we took was fine to applications for 
ted_1359_0292610_0294100 and rebuild an ipad application 
ted_1359_0294630_0298760 we made an application for layer augmented reality to find these 
ted_1359_0299440_0310750 whenever you were in a city like maastricht and somebody collapse you can use your iphone and within the next week's ulcer on your microsoft cell phone to find the nearest eighty which can save lives 
ted_1359_0311400_0318310 as of today we would like to introduce this not only as a day for you which is the product called but also eighty for us 
ted_1359_0318980_0321040 we would like to start this on a worldwide level 
ted_1359_0321500_0340160 asking all colleagues of us in the rest of the world colleague universities to help us to find and work and act like a hop to crowdsource all these eddies around the world that whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses might be your own relative or someone just in front of you you can find this 
ted_1359_0340660_0347170 the other thing we would like to ask is companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these eddies 
ted_1359_0347570_0354450 might be courier services or cable guys for instance just to see whether the eighty that submitted still is in place 
ted_1359_0355100_0360810 so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better but take control of it 
ted_1359_0361170_0361520 center 
ted_1359_0366115_0366315 
ted_1366_0012900_0017360 story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago 
ted_1366_0017950_0022500 i live in the desert under the starry skies with the sufi finger militarily 
ted_1366_0022870_0028900 we run conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the mahabharata 
ted_1366_0029810_0035410 so back in the day when as indians wanted to travel we jump into each area and we zoom across the sky 
ted_1366_0036060_0038130 we do the same with aeroplane 
ted_1366_0038890_0047060 back then when arginine the great indian warrior prince when he was thirsty he'd take out a ball he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out 
ted_1366_0047560_0050790 we do the same withdrew and machine 
ted_1366_0051700_0063200 the conclusion that became do with that magic had been replaced by machinery and this made me really sad i found myself becoming a little bit of for technophobes 
ted_1366_0063200_0072280 i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me without tweeting into my friends 
ted_1366_0072730_0077250 it felt like it felt like technology should enable magic not kill it when 
ted_1366_0077250_0081600 when i was a little girl my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch 
ted_1366_0081850_0086760 this piece of fifty year old technology became the most magical thing to me 
ted_1366_0086940_0093210 it became a gilded gateway into a world full of pirates and shipwrecks and images in my imagination 
ted_1366_0094100_0100080 so i felt like our cell phones and our fancy watches and cameras had stopped us from dreaming 
ted_1366_0100080_0102330 it stopped us from being inspired 
ted_1366_0102550_0108950 so i jumped in i jumped into this world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it 
ted_1366_0109680_0112020 been illustrating books since i was sixteen 
ted_1366_0112210_0118190 so when i thought the ipad i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world 
ted_1366_0118210_0121790 good it good it could know how they're holding 
ted_1366_0121790_0123790 can it can know where we are 
ted_1366_0124190_0128610 it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch 
ted_1366_0129010_0132400 storytelling is becoming more and more monkeys and theory 
ted_1366_0132600_0133720 what are we doing with it 
ted_1366_0133990_0140100 so i'm just going to go in and launch korea and interactive app for the ipad 
ted_1366_0141890_0177940 it says place your fingers upon each light and so the and so i type in my name 
ted_1366_0179120_0180850 actually become a character 
ted_1366_0181080_0187990 admitted coin a little later dropped down to me and the ipad know where you live because gps actually addressed to me 
ted_1366_0188230_0191330 with child and me really hated by these kind of both ability 
ted_1366_0192920_0195210 i've been talking a lot about magic 
ted_1366_0195360_0202650 i don't mean desert and dragons i mean the kind of childhood magic build ideas that we all have our children 
ted_1366_0203340_0207460 fireflies and a job for some reason with always really exciting to me 
ted_1366_0207750_0211820 over here you need to take the fireflies 
ted_1366_0212340_0214290 they actually illuminate your way through 
ted_1366_0218950_0225640 another idea that really touched me as a child with an entire galaxy could be contained within a single mother 
ted_1366_0226250_0235570 each book and each world become into a little model that i drag in this magical device within the debate 
ted_1366_0237100_0240630 it opens up a map 
ted_1366_0242450_0246490 another long often people have always had managed to these maps had been hidden 
ted_1366_0246500_0250990 and this is a map that grow oven gloves and become navigation for the rest of the world 
ted_1366_0251240_0253890 revealed itself at certain points in the book as well 
ted_1366_0254620_0256580 enter in 
ted_1366_0259100_0266270 and another thing that's actually really important to me it's creating content that is indian and yet very contemporary 
ted_1366_0266890_0268640 these are the appearance 
ted_1366_0268820_0277020 so we all heard about fed even we've all heard about names but how many people outside of india know about that indian counterparts the absurdity 
ted_1366_0277290_0283460 or should have been trapped in faith in droves chamber for thousands of years when an oil in my head 
ted_1366_0284140_0287320 bringing them back during cooking 
ted_1366_0287370_0300140 the environment 
ted_1366_0326710_0333680 i think a big problem has been in the last ten years is that children have been locked inside their rooms glued to their pcs they haven't been able to get out 
ted_1366_0333960_0339830 but now with mobile technology we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology 
ted_1366_0340250_0350530 one of the interactions in the book is that you're sent off on the squished where you need to go outside take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects 
ted_1366_0350880_0355780 when i was a child i had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells 
ted_1366_0356040_0357790 kids don't do that anymore 
ted_1366_0357970_0365000 so in bringing back to childhood ritual you need to go out and in one chapter take a picture of a flower and then tag 
ted_1366_0366240_0369850 in another chapter you need to take a picture of a piece of bach and then tag that 
ted_1366_0370110_0375260 what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online 
ted_1366_0375560_0387030 a child in london puts up a picture for fox and says i saw a fox today a child in india says i thought monkey today and it creates a kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you've actually taken 
ted_1366_0387400_0395210 in terms of in the possibilities of linking together magic the earth and technology there are multiple possibilities 
ted_1366_0395350_0406710 the next book we plan on having an interaction where you take your ipad out with the video on and through augmented reality you see this layer of animated pixies appear on a houseplant that's outside your home 
ted_1366_0407540_0410010 at one point your screen is filled up with leaves 
ted_1366_0410010_0415260 and so you need to make the sound of wind blow them away and read the rest of the book 
ted_1366_0416450_0425780 hanging there are moving to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology and magic and technology can come come closer together 
ted_1366_0426000_0429030 harnessing energy from the sun than that 
ted_1366_0429030_0439410 bringing our children and closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of the story 
ted_1366_0439800_0440240 thank you 
ted_1366_0451235_0451435 
ted_1368_0012670_0045430 how can i be in ten minutes about the bones of women over three generations about how the astonishing string of those bonds took hold in the life of a four year old girl huddled with her younger sister her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat and the china sea more than thirty years ago bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today 
ted_1368_0047060_0048570 it was not a finished story 
ted_1368_0049490_0051890 a jigsaw puzzle still being put together 
ted_1368_0053230_0055000 for me tell you about some of the pieces 
ted_1368_0056920_0070310 imagine the first piece a man burning his life work here the poet a playwright a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hook of his country's unity and freedom 
ted_1368_0071250_0077420 imagine him as the communists enter saigon confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste 
ted_1368_0078450_0080960 word for so long he friends now mocked him 
ted_1368_0082230_0083670 he retreated into silence 
ted_1368_0084710_0086730 guide broken by history 
ted_1368_0088410_0089910 my grandfather 
ted_1368_0091080_0092570 i never knew him in real life 
ted_1368_0094980_0097170 but our lives are much more than our memory 
ted_1368_0098400_0100830 and my grandmother never let me forget his life 
ted_1368_0101660_0110150 duty with not to allow it to have been in vain and my lesson was to learn that year history tried to crush us but we endured 
ted_1368_0111990_0117410 connect piece of the jigsaw either the boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea 
ted_1368_0118830_0126390 my mother my with eighteen when her father died already in an arranged marriage already with two small girls 
ted_1368_0127480_0134130 for her life had instilled itself into one task the escape of her family and a new life in australia 
ted_1368_0135510_0138190 it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed 
ted_1368_0139680_0145720 so after four year saga that defies fiction a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel 
ted_1368_0147400_0149050 for the adult knew the risks 
ted_1368_0150360_0153500 greatest fear was of pirates rape and death 
ted_1368_0155000_0159090 unlike most adult on the boat my mother carried a small bottle of poison 
ted_1368_0160460_0165630 we were captured first my sister and i then she and my grandmother would drink 
ted_1368_0167450_0176660 my first memories from the boat the steady beat of the engine the bow dipping into each wave the vast and empty horizon 
ted_1368_0178020_0187800 i don't remember the pirates who came many times but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours 
ted_1368_0189230_0203520 but i do remember the light from the oil rig off the malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died the journeys and too much for him and the first apple i tasted given to me by the men 
ted_1368_0204580_0206860 apple has never tasted the same 
ted_1368_0210180_0213690 after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne 
ted_1368_0214230_0220090 the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together 
ted_1368_0222090_0227810 we settled in footscray a working class suburb his demographic is layers of immigrants 
ted_1368_0228490_0234980 unlike the settled middle class suburb whose existence i was oblivious though there was no sense of entitlement in footscray 
ted_1368_0235910_0238620 the smell from shop doors were from the rest of the world 
ted_1368_0239090_0245510 the snippets of halting english were exchanged between people who had one thing in common they were starting again 
ted_1368_0247440_0253050 my mother worked on farms then on a car assembly line working six days double shift 
ted_1368_0254160_0273560 somehow she found time to study english and gain i t qualifications we were poor organ donors who are allocated an extra tuition in english and mathematics with budgeted for regardless of what without which was usually new clothes they will always that can hand 
ted_1368_0274330_0278050 prepare the stocking for school each to hide the holes in the other 
ted_1368_0278960_0282980 school uniform down to the ankles because it had to last for six years 
ted_1368_0284780_0293780 they will read but searing chants of fly and the occasional graffiti asian go home go home to wear 
ted_1368_0294980_0296600 something different inside me 
ted_1368_0297380_0301800 with a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying i will bypass 
ted_1368_0303970_0307310 and my mother my sister and i flipped in the same bed 
ted_1368_0308630_0315790 my mother was exhausted each night but we told one another about our day and listen to the movements of my grandmother around the house 
ted_1368_0317160_0319890 my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat 
ted_1368_0321470_0325170 my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her 
ted_1368_0328040_0332610 she opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business 
ted_1368_0333470_0342000 the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition angry and inflexible and troubled children caught between two worlds 
ted_1368_0343130_0349480 grantham sponsors resort centers were established and lived in parallel worlds 
ted_1368_0350040_0355450 in one of the classic asian student relentless in the demands made on myself 
ted_1368_0356550_0363150 the other i was enmeshed in lives that were precarious tragically scarred by finding drug abuse and isolation 
ted_1368_0364680_0366530 with so many over the years will help 
ted_1368_0366760_0371980 would that work when i was the final year law student i was chosen as the young australian of the year 
ted_1368_0372290_0377750 bandwidth catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another and the edges didn't fit 
ted_1368_0378840_0396010 calmly anonymous footscray resident with now calmly refugee and social activist invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into conflict with whom she could never have imagined i didn't know the protocols i didn't know how to use the cutlery 
ted_1368_0397130_0399120 i didn't know how to talk about why 
ted_1368_0399860_0401920 i didn't know how to talk about anything 
ted_1368_0403430_0421760 i wanted to retreat to the routine and comfort of life in an unsung suburb a grandmother a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost twenty years telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep the three of us still in the same bed 
ted_1368_0424160_0425910 i told my mother i couldn't do it 
ted_1368_0427730_0439360 she reminded me that i was now the same a she had been when we boarded the boat no had never been an option just do it she said and don't be what you're not 
ted_1368_0441160_0451190 so i spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised and the more candidly iceberg the more i was asked to speak 
ted_1368_0453270_0459840 people from all walks of life so many of them doing the thing they loved living on the frontiers of possibility 
ted_1368_0460560_0465940 even though i finished my degree i realized i could not fatal into a career in law 
ted_1368_0466660_0468600 it had to be another piece of the jigsaw 
ted_1368_0469910_0484300 i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider a recent arrival new on the scene and not just ok but something to be thankful for perhaps a gift from the boat 
ted_1368_0485270_0493420 because being an insider can flow easily mean collapsing the horizons can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province 
ted_1368_0494950_0501640 stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that the world does fall apart but not in the way that you fear 
ted_1368_0502530_0506450 possibility that would not have been allowed for outrageously encouraged 
ted_1368_0507000_0513050 with an energy there and implacable optimism a strange mixture of humility and daring 
ted_1368_0514310_0515560 so i followed my hunches 
ted_1368_0516050_0522180 i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can't be done with an irresistible challenge 
ted_1368_0523360_0524780 for a year we were penniless 
ted_1368_0525390_0528830 at the end of each day i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared 
ted_1368_0529920_0531440 we worked well into each night 
ted_1368_0532320_0537380 most of our ideas were crazy but a few were brilliant and we broke through 
ted_1368_0539530_0549450 i made the decision to move to the u s after only one trip my hunches again three months later i had relocated and the adventure has continued 
ted_1368_0551640_0554590 before i close the let me tell you about my grandmother 
ted_1368_0556050_0561930 if she grew up at a time when confucianism with the social norm and the local mandarin with the person who mattered 
ted_1368_0562950_0564790 life hadn't changed for centuries 
ted_1368_0566080_0568590 her father died soon after she was born 
ted_1368_0569700_0571080 her mother raised her alone 
ted_1368_0572680_0577310 at seventeen she became the second life of a mandarin whose mother beat her 
ted_1368_0578740_0596950 with no support from her husband he caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case and a far greater sensation when she won it can't be done was shown to be wrong 
ted_1368_0600620_0607620 taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died six hundred miles away in melbourne 
ted_1368_0609090_0612380 i looked through the showers green and foil standing on the other side 
ted_1368_0613230_0614920 i knew she had come to say goodbye 
ted_1368_0615940_0617540 my mother phoned minutes later 
ted_1368_0619320_0623880 a few days later we went to a buddhist temple in footscray and fat around her casket 
ted_1368_0624930_0628300 we told her story and assured her that we were still with her 
ted_1368_0629710_0634250 midnight the blank came and told us he had closed casket 
ted_1368_0635410_0637620 my mother after to feel her hand 
ted_1368_0638540_0650850 she often monk why is it that her hand is so womb and the rest of the so called because you have been holding it since this morning he said he would have not let it go 
ted_1368_0654230_0657930 continue in our family it runs through the women 
ted_1368_0659050_0666410 but given who we were and how life had shaped us we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have florida 
ted_1368_0667360_0669130 defeat would have come to easily 
ted_1368_0670600_0674290 and now i would like to have my own children and i wondered about the boat 
ted_1368_0675800_0677550 we could ever wish it on their own 
ted_1368_0678960_0683300 i am afraid of privilege of ease of entitlement 
ted_1368_0684410_0712140 can i give them a bow in their lives keeping bravely into each wave the unperturbed and steady beat the engine the vast horizon that guarantees nothing i don't know but if i could give it and still see them safely through i would 
ted_1368_0712100_0712300 applause 
ted_1368_0714520_0722620 mother here today 
ted_1371_0012490_0024480 kevin a lock on the trends manager youtube and i professionally watch youtube videos so we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters 
ted_1371_0025050_0032630 we all want to be stars celebrities singers comedians and when i was younger that seems so very very hard to do 
ted_1371_0033060_0039970 but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our worlds culture 
ted_1371_0041030_0043930 if any one of you can be famous on the internet by next saturday 
ted_1371_0044220_0047970 but there are over forty eight hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute 
ted_1371_0048780_0053930 of that only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and get tons of use and becomes a cultural moment 
ted_1371_0053930_0055330 so how did that happen 
ted_1371_0056260_0060560 three things tastemakers communities of participation 
ted_1371_0062020_0062300 
ted_1371_0067980_0073960 
ted_1371_0075350_0077330 
ted_1371_0077600_0082400 we're bear baskets posted this video that he had shot outside his home in yosemite national park 
ted_1371_0082700_0091080 in two thousand and ten it was twenty three million times the charter what it looked like when it first became popular last summer 
ted_1371_0092220_0095060 but he didn't actually set out to make a viral video bear 
ted_1371_0095090_0096900 he just wanted to share a rainbow 
ted_1371_0097220_0104810 because that's what you do in your name is yosemite mountain bear and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact 
ted_1371_0104810_0108000 this video posted all the way back in january 
ted_1371_0108920_0118680 so what happened here jimmy kimmel actually jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that will eventually propel the video to be as popular as it had become 
ted_1371_0119010_0124330 because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduces new and interesting things and bring them to a larger 
ted_1371_0136560_0142720 so you didn't think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video i hope 
ted_1371_0143810_0146610 rebecca black's friday is one of the most popular videos of the year 
ted_1371_0146650_0149450 it's been seen nearly two hundred million times this year 
ted_1371_0150550_0151920 is a chart of what it looked like 
ted_1371_0151930_0156260 and similar to double rainbow it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere 
ted_1371_0157240_0159070 so what happened on this day 
ted_1371_0159730_0161770 well it was a friday 
ted_1371_0162440_0173280 and if you're wondering about those other spikes those are also friday but what about this day this one particular friday 
ted_1371_0174330_0177460 well josh point zero picks it up a lot of blogs started writing about 
ted_1371_0177540_0182690 michael j nelson for mystery science theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on twitter 
ted_1371_0183000_0190330 what's important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience accelerating the process 
ted_1371_0190730_0197150 so then this community formed of people who share this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it 
ted_1371_0197470_0200230 now there are ten thousand parodies of friday 
ted_1371_0200720_0219080 even in the first seven days there was one parody for every other day of the week unlike the one way entertainment of the twentieth century this community participation that's how we become a part of the phenomenon of either by spreading it or doing something new 
ted_1371_0223195_0223395 
ted_1371_0228770_0232970 the cat is a looped animation with live music 
ted_1371_0233440_0235280 this just like that 
ted_1371_0235380_0239210 been viewed nearly fifty million times this year 
ted_1371_0239670_0257740 if you think that it's weird you should know that there is a three hour version of this has been huge four million times even cats were watching this video cats were watching other cats watch this video 
ted_1371_0266995_0267195 applause 
ted_1371_0267120_0274810 what's important here what's important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst the techie geeky internet culture 
ted_1371_0274810_0308770 there were remixes made an old timey version the men who went international the entire remixed communities sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joked something that we could all actually be a part of 
ted_1371_0309100_0312010 because we don't just enjoy now we participate 
ted_1371_0315830_0317540 who could have predicted any of this 
ted_1371_0317540_0325830 we could have predicted to double rainbow rebecca black or cat scripts could you have written that would have contained within it 
ted_1371_0326890_0334710 in a world where over two days of video uploaded every minute only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things happen 
ted_1371_0335130_0343030 when a friend of mine told me that i needed to see this this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines and new york city i admit i wasn't very interested 
ted_1371_0343290_0356020 the claim the 
ted_1371_0356020_0356340 applause 
ted_1371_0361830_0373320 by being totally surprising and humorous casey nice that got his funny idea and point five million times 
ted_1371_0373920_0377180 this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively 
ted_1371_0377760_0380910 and so it all brings us to one big question 
ted_1371_0382620_0390850 what does it mean 
ted_1371_0392460_0392740 case 
ted_1371_0392750_0393430 filmmakers 
ted_1371_0393600_0404600 creative participating communities complete unexpectedness these characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience to find the popularity 
ted_1371_0405060_0410020 as mentioned earlier one of the biggest stars in the world right now justin bieber got his start on 
ted_1371_0410880_0412940 one has to greenlight your idea 
ted_1371_0413450_0416590 we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture 
ted_1371_0417160_0424790 these are not characteristics of old media and they're barely true of the media have today but they will define the entertainment of the future 
ted_1371_0425250_0425500 thank you 
ted_1371_0425425_0425625 
ted_1375_0025460_0034770 cyber attacks treble mass destruction tornado recession decay jews disaster 
ted_1375_0034770_0044020 so those are just a few the clips i collected over the last six months could have easily been in the last six days or the last six years 
ted_1375_0044580_0051870 the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that's what our minds pay attention to 
ted_1375_0053460_0054800 very good reason for that 
ted_1375_0055000_0061110 if every second of every day our senses bring and way too much data that we can possibly process and our brains 
ted_1375_0061810_0070850 and because nothing is more important to us than survival the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala 
ted_1375_0072020_0076290 amygdala is our early warning detector or danger detector 
ted_1375_0076870_0082010 shorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything the environment that might harm us 
ted_1375_0082770_0087450 so given a dozen new stories we will preferentially look at the negative news 
ted_1375_0088910_0093420 that old newspaper saying if it bleeds it leads is very true 
ted_1375_0095190_0104220 so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week twenty four hours a day it's no wonder that we're pessimistic 
ted_1375_0104890_0108150 no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse 
ted_1375_0110330_0112580 but perhaps that's not the case 
ted_1375_0113480_0118880 perhaps instead it's the distortions brought to us but what's really going on 
ted_1375_0120550_0144180 perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century by a series of forces are in fact accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance now i'm not saying we don't have our set of problems climate crisis species extinction water and energy shortage we surely do 
ted_1375_0144610_0151390 as humans we are far better at seeing the problems wayne advance but ultimately we knock them down 
ted_1375_0153680_0159290 so let's look at what this last century has been to see where we're going 
ted_1375_0160120_0168980 over the last hundred years the average human lifespan has more than doubled average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled 
ted_1375_0169580_0172580 childhood mortality has come down a factor of ten 
ted_1375_0174300_0179570 add to that the cost of food electricity transportation communication have dropped ten two thousand 
ted_1375_0179620_0186970 fold steve pinker has showed us that in fact we're living during the most peaceful time ever in humans 
ted_1375_0188650_0195450 and charles kenny that global literacy has gone from twenty five percent over eighty percent in the last one hundred and thirty years 
ted_1375_0196530_0199100 we truly are living in an extraordinary time 
ted_1375_0200530_0201950 many people forget this 
ted_1375_0202490_0205330 we keep setting our expectations higher and higher 
ted_1375_0205550_0207940 in fact we redefine what poverty means 
ted_1375_0208620_0219750 in america today the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity water toilets refrigerators television mobile phones air conditioning and cars 
ted_1375_0221270_0227160 the wealthiest robber barons of the last century the emperor's on this planet could never dreamed of such luxuries 
ted_1375_0231290_0238060 underpinning much of this is technology and of late exponentially growing technologies 
ted_1375_0239460_0251760 my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve on moore's law and experiences price performance doubling every twelve to twenty four months 
ted_1375_0252650_0258170 why the cell phone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper in one thousand times fashion a supercomputer of the seventies 
ted_1375_0258390_0259530 look at this curve 
ted_1375_0260290_0262760 is moore's law over the last hundred years 
ted_1375_0262760_0264630 when you're noticed two things from this curve 
ted_1375_0264800_0273120 number one how smooth it is through good time and bad time wartime and peacetime recession depression and boom time 
ted_1375_0275210_0278810 the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers 
ted_1375_0280470_0283110 it doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges 
ted_1375_0284110_0288780 also even though it's plotted on a log curve on the left it's curving upwards 
ted_1375_0289220_0292850 the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster 
ted_1375_0294590_0302690 on this curve riding on moore's law or a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us 
ted_1375_0303210_0327280 cloud computing what my friends with autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics three d printing which the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet synthetic biology fuels vaccines and foods digital medicine nanomaterials and ai how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson 
ted_1375_0327820_0334810 that was epic in fact i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could 
ted_1375_0334810_0340840 and i love this watson vanquishes human opponents jeopardy is not an easy game 
ted_1375_0341410_0343570 about the nuance of human language 
ted_1375_0344090_0349540 imagine if you would a i like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell phone 
ted_1375_0352060_0364780 four years ago here at ted ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university and we teach our students all of these technologies in particular how they can be used to solve humanity's grand challenges 
ted_1375_0366120_0374630 every year we ask them to start a company or product or a service that can affect positively lives of a billion people within a decade 
ted_1375_0375830_0381620 think about the fact that literally a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today 
ted_1375_0382200_0383930 for thirty years ago i would have sounded ludicrous 
ted_1375_0384120_0390140 you can point at dozens of companies that have done just that when i think about 
ted_1375_0390140_0399730 when i think about creating abundance it's not about creating a life of luxury for business planet it's about creating a life of possibility 
ted_1375_0401030_0405410 it 's about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant 
ted_1375_0405890_0413430 we see scarcity is contextual and technology is a resource liberating force 
ted_1375_0414370_0415330 let me give you an example 
ted_1375_0416720_0422070 so this is a story of napoleon the third in the mid one thousand eight hundred he's the dude on the left 
ted_1375_0423690_0426360 he invited over to dinner the king of siam 
ted_1375_0428640_0434770 napoleon's troops were fed with silver utensils napoleon himself with gold utensils 
ted_1375_0434770_0438630 but the king of siam he was fed with aluminum utensils 
ted_1375_0439120_0445810 aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet worth more than gold and platinum 
ted_1375_0446710_0450720 the reason that the tip of the washington monument is made of aluminum 
ted_1375_0451570_0458080 even though aluminum is eight point three percent of the earth by mass it doesn't come to the pure metal 
ted_1375_0458420_0460470 all bound by oxygen and silly 
ted_1375_0461910_0469700 within a technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throwaway mentality 
ted_1375_0470730_0472740 flex project this analogy going forward 
ted_1375_0474500_0476290 we think about energy scarcity 
ted_1375_0477460_0484860 ladies and gentlemen we are on a planet that is bathed with five thousand times more energy than we use 
ted_1375_0484860_0490200 a year sixteen terawatts of energy hit the earth's surface every eighty eight 
ted_1375_0490330_0494480 five minutes it's not about being scarce it's about 
ted_1375_0496460_0497640 there is good news here 
ted_1375_0498660_0509980 for the first time this year the cost of solar generated electricity is fifty percent that of diesel generated electricity in india eight point eight rupees versus seventeen rupees 
ted_1375_0510270_0512620 the cost of solar dropped fifty percent last year 
ted_1375_0512900_0524150 last month mit put out a study showing up at the end of this decade and the funny part is the united states solar electricity six cents a kilowatt hour compared to fifteen cents at the national average 
ted_1375_0525230_0534100 and if we have abundant energy we also have abundant water not we talked about water wars 
ted_1375_0535830_0543430 do you remember when carl sagan turn the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth in one thousand nine hundred and the effort just passed saturn 
ted_1375_0543670_0544750 he took a famous photo 
ted_1375_0544750_0551210 was called a pale blue dot because we live on a water planet 
ted_1375_0551900_0554700 we live on a planet seventy percent covered by water 
ted_1375_0554950_0563570 ninety seven point five percent and saltwater two percent of ice and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet but here too there is hope 
ted_1375_0564280_0569520 there 's technology coming online not can twenty years from now right now 
ted_1375_0570950_0572950 nanotechnology coming on 
ted_1375_0573500_0587810 and the conversation i had with being came in this morning when the great diy innovators i'd like to share with you he gave me permission to do so his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of its the size of a small dorm room refrigerator 
ted_1375_0588000_0596990 but able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater polluted water latrine at less than two cents a liter 
ted_1375_0599680_0606250 the chairman of coca cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world 
ted_1375_0606410_0615600 if that pans out which have every confidence it will coca cola will deploy this globally to two hundred and six countries around the planet 
ted_1375_0616610_0621230 this is the kind of innovation empowered by this technology that exist today 
ted_1375_0623420_0625140 and we've seen this in cell phones 
ted_1375_0625140_0631870 my goodness we're going to hit seventy percent penetration of cell phones in the developing world by the end of two thousand and thirteen 
ted_1375_0632200_0639860 think about it that a mass i warrior on a cell phone in the middle of kenya has better mobile common president reagan did twenty five years ago 
ted_1375_0642380_0647670 if they're on a smartphone on google they've got access to more knowledge information president clinton did fifteen years ago 
ted_1375_0648010_0652460 living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could ever predicted 
ted_1375_0654620_0672660 better than that the things that you and i spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for gps hd video and still images libraries of books and music medical diagnostic technology are now literally dematerializing and d monetizing into your cell phone 
ted_1375_0676980_0680220 probably the best part of it is what's coming down the pike in health 
ted_1375_0681570_0688560 last month i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the ten million dollar qualcomm tricorder x 
ted_1375_0688560_0699510 prize were challenging teams around the world to basically combined these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to could have gotten ai you can cough on it you can do a finger blood 
ted_1375_0699970_0704450 when he fell to diagnose you better than a team of board certified doctors 
ted_1375_0706640_0716910 so literally imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors twenty five percent of the disease burden one point three percent of the health care workers 
ted_1375_0717830_0725480 when this device sequences and rna or dna virus and it doesn't recognize it cause the cdc prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place 
ted_1375_0728650_0733480 but here here is the biggest force for bringing about world of abundance 
ted_1375_0733540_0735420 i call it the rising billion 
ted_1375_0736700_0739160 so the white lines here are population 
ted_1375_0739520_0742290 we just passed the seven billion mark on earth 
ted_1375_0742540_0749470 and by the way the biggest protection against the population explosion is making the world educated and healthy 
ted_1375_0751630_0756270 two thousand and ten we had just short of two billion people online connected 
ted_1375_0757970_0762680 by two thousand and twenty that's going from two billion to five billion internet users 
ted_1375_0763480_0770650 three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation 
ted_1375_0771760_0772940 what will these people want 
ted_1375_0773320_0774070 they consume 
ted_1375_0774070_0774960 if only desire 
ted_1375_0775300_0780460 rather than having economic shutdown weren't about to have the biggest economic injection ever 
ted_1375_0780790_0786260 people represent can have trillions of dollars injected into the global economy 
ted_1375_0788400_0801430 they will get healthier by using a try quarter and it will become better educated by using the khan academy and by literally being able to use three d printing and an infinite computing more productive than ever before 
ted_1375_0802650_0809330 so what could three billion rising healthy educated productive members of humanity bring to us 
ted_1375_0810930_0813310 how about a set of voices have never been heard from before 
ted_1375_0814240_0821490 what about giving the oppressed wherever they might be the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever 
ted_1375_0822410_0823950 what do these three billion people bring 
ted_1375_0825410_0828490 what about contributions we can't even predict 
ted_1375_0829030_0841390 one thing i've learned that the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past 
ted_1375_0842280_0846280 so let me share and close with a story that really got me excited 
ted_1375_0847880_0849820 there is a program that familiar you might have heard 
ted_1375_0849820_0850700 game called 
ted_1375_0851020_0854490 it came out of the university of washington in seattle 
ted_1375_0855670_0864420 this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acid and figure out how the protein is going to fold 
ted_1375_0865520_0868180 and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality 
ted_1375_0868180_0869900 it 's very important for research and medicine 
ted_1375_0870080_0872320 up until now it's been a supercomputer problem 
ted_1375_0873990_0877480 this game has been played by university professors and so forth 
ted_1375_0877480_0882390 and it's literally hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing 
ted_1375_0882420_0888700 and it showed that in fact today the human pattern recognition machinery is better folding proteins in the best computers 
ted_1375_0889790_0911870 when these individuals went and looked at who is the best protein folder in the world it wasn't an mit professor wasn't at caltech student with a person from england from manchester a woman who during the day was an executive assistant into rehab clinic and at night with the world's best protein folder 
ted_1375_0914570_0927820 ladies and gentlemen what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered individuals to take on the grand challenges on this planet 
ted_1375_0928550_0931300 we have the tools with this exponential technology 
ted_1375_0931560_0933820 we have the passion of the diy innovator 
ted_1375_0934040_0937200 we have the capital of the of the techno philanthropist 
ted_1375_0937450_0945870 we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges to do that which we must do 
ted_1375_0947200_0949760 we are living into an extraordinary decades ahead 
ted_1375_0950050_0962780 thank you 
ted_1375_0962705_0962905
