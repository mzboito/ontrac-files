one morning ladies and gentlemen 
by name as art benjamin and i am a mathemagician what that means is i combine my love of math and magic to do something i call mathemagics but before i get started i have a quick question for the audience 
by any chance did anyone happened to bring with them this morning a calculator 
seriously if you have a calculator with you raise your hand raise your hand i was hanging 
bring bring it out bring it out anybody else i see i see one way in the back 
certainly that's three 
and anybody on the side here 
you over there on the aisle 
with the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators then join me up on stage 
plenty of these volunteers the next round of applause 

now since i haven't had the chance to work with these calculators i need to make sure that they are all working properly 
with somebody get us started by giving us a two digit number please 
how about a two digit number 
twenty two and another two digit number sir 

multiply two thousand and two times forty seven make sure you get one thousand and thirty four or the calculators are now 
working to all of you 
one thousand and thirty four 
one thousand and thirty four five ninety four let's give three and i'm a nice round 
seven 
applaud their would you like to try and more standard calculator just in case ok great what i'm going to try and do them i noticed that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer that's okay i'll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster 
from the calculator there's something called the square of a number which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying 
it by itself for instance five 
squared 
be quantified now the way we can square on most calculators let me demonstrate with this one is by taking the numbers such as five hitting times and then equals and on most calculators that will give 
the square on some of these ancient rpn calculators you've got an x squared button on it will allow you to do 
calculation even faster when i'm going to try and do now is to square in my head for two digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators even use 
a shortcut method uses the second row for a view one two three four th yell out a two digit number and if you would square the first number and a few square the second the third and the fourth i will try and ratio to the answer okay so quickly 
imagine numbers 
please thirty seven 
squared 
ok 
twenty three squared ok fifty nine square 
ok 
finally ninety three squared would you call out 
is your answers please 
sixty nine five twenty nine thirty forty one 

applause 
a very much let me try to take this 
one step further going to try to square some three digit 
numbers this time i won't even write these down i'll just call them out as their quality 
to me anyone i point to call out 
three digit number anyone on our panel 
and verify the answer just give some indication 
if it's a three digit 
a number 
nine eighty seven 
squared 
one thousand nine hundred and seventy four thousand one hundred and sixty nine yet another 
another three digit another era another three digit number sir for fifty seven sport has two hundred and five thousand eight hundred and forty nine to zero five eight for nine yet another 
digit number sir three twenty one is one hundred and three thousand and forty one one zero three zero for one yeah well more three digit number plate seven two thousand and two 
one hundred and eleven 
carter one that five hundred and thirteen thousand two hundred and eighty four 
for one more three digit number plate one sixty two 
squared 
his two thousand and six thousand two hundred and forty four thank you very much 

so let me try to take this one step further i'm going 
with try to square a four digit number this time now you can all take your time on this i will not lead you to the answer on this 
one but i will try to get the answer right to make this a little bit more random let's take out 
fourth row this time would say one two three four if each of you acquire a single digits between zero and nine 


below 
before digit number that i'll square nine seven five eight nine thousand and five acres will take a 
a little 
but it 
sometimes so bear with me 
one thousand nine 
million two hundred and eighteen thousand five hundred and sixty four thank you very much now i would attempt to square 

five digit number and i can be 
unfortunately most calculators cannot eight legged capacity don't you 
bad so sensitive 
we reached the limit 
calculators with that 
as years go go higher 
talk to you later in the meanwhile let me conclude 
for the first part of my show by doing something 
a little trickier let's take the largest number 
billboard here a fix for nine with huge enter that on your calculator and instead of squaring at this time i want you to take that number and multiply it by any three digit number that you want but don't tell me what 
we are multiplying by just multiplied by any random three digit number so you should have 
and the answer either a six digit or probably 
seven digit number 
he didn't 
we have six or seven seven and yours seven seven and uncertain seven is there any 
possible way 
with 
it could know what seven digit numbers you have say no 
then i shall attempt the impossible or at least the improbable what i'd like each of you to do is to call out for me any fix 
words 
seven digits any six of them in any order you'd like one digit 
time i shall try and determine the digit you've left out so starting 
with your seven digit number sonicwall 
seventy six of them please 
we leave out the number six good ok that's one 
seven seven digit number 
but any six of them please 
i think five numbers for if i went for four eight seven five 
between about the number six same as she did ok you've got to seven digit number called anything 
for them loud 
sinclair i think you look out the number three that three the odd to me getting all four of these right 
random guessing would be one 
in ten thousand and ten to the fourth 
power ok anything to them really 
scramble up the time 
he did not the numbers 
give all four of these people round of applause thank you very much for my next number 
i mentally recharge my batteries i have one more question for the audience by any chance that anybody here 
what happened to know the day of the week that they were 
born on if you think you know your birth day 
raise your hand at the starting with 
we start with a gentleman first ok so what year 
first of all i started a gentleman 
what your nine hundred and fifty three and a month 
in november one twenty third was that a monday yes good somebody else who else would like piano haven't seen anything like a year forty nine in the one october what was that 
wednesday yes i'll go away 
another 
back right now have 
a yellow 
what year nine hundred and fifty nine ok 
a month february what was that a friday good 
what about the person behind her 
what year 
forty seven 
someone may want 
seven 
would that be on wednesday thank you very much anybody 
peter who'd like to know that 
day of the week they were born we can do it that way you could just make 
up an answer and you wouldn't know 
come prepared for that i brought with me a book of calendars 
it goes 
as far back into the path as eight thousand eight hundred cars you never know 
i didn't mean to look at you you are just kidding 
anyway i prefer you can help me out here if you wouldn't mind the book of counters and alyeska who was the one 
another one year was first 
sixty six turns 
for the calendar with nine hundred and sixty six and and what one april one thousand 
applause 
i believe that was a sunday and you confirm chris yeah ok ok iowa chris as long as you have that book the book in front of you do me a favor turned to a year outside in one thousand eight hundred's either in the one thousand eight hundred 
away into the two thousand that will be a much greater challenge 
for me what chris 
we like twenty four 
k and 
one june june one fixed was that a sunday 
applause 
and it was cloudy thank you very much but i'd like 
wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in 
presentation with the gentlemen up here who had a 
a ten digit calculator where is he would you stand up ten digit guy okay well stand up 
images per second i can see where you're ok you have a ten digit calculator sir as well ok what i'm going to try and do is 
square in my head a five digit number requiring a ten digit calculator but to make my job more interesting for you 
well as for me i'm going to do this problem thinking out loud so you can actually honestly here what 
going on in my mind while i do a calculation 
size now i have to apologize to our magician friend lennart green i know as a magician were not supposed to reveal our secrets but i'm not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week so i think we're ok 
so let's take a let's take a different row of people are starting with you 
get five digits one two three four this already 
in the row before you start with user one two three four five crowd a single digit now 
cbs 

five 
fidgeting 
a number that i will 
try to square five seven six a three fifty seven thousand six hundred eighty three 
squared yuck let me let me explain to you how i'm going 
who attempt this problem going to break the problem down into three 
parts of the fifty seven thousand squared plus six hundred and eighty three squared plus fifty seven thousand kinds 
crimes to add all those numbers 
together and with any luck arrive at the 
cancer now let me recap thank you while i explain something else i know that you can use right hook for internet while 
believe calculation you might hear 
certain words as opposed to numbers creep into the calculation let me explain what that is 
phonetic code a mnemonic device that i use that allows me 
convert numbers into words i store them 
his words and later on retrieve them as numbers i know it sounds 
complicated 
it 's not just don't want you to think you're seeing 
something 
a lot of rain man here there's definitely a method to my madness definitely definitely not 
you want to talk to me about a d h d afterwards you can documented by the way one left instruction for my judges with the calculators ok you know who 
there is at least a fifty percent chance that i will make a mistake here if i do don't tell me what the mistake is just say your close or something like 
that and i'll try and figure out the answer which can be pretty entertaining 
canada 
itself if however i am right whatever you do don't keep it to yourself making 
for sure everybody knows that i got the answer 
bright because this is my big finish okay so without any 
forestalling here we go i'll start the problem in the middle and fifty seven times sixty three now fifty sometimes sixty eight thirty four hundred plus 
seven hundred and sixty plus one seventy one 
found something more than thirty eight thousand and nine thirty one thirty eight thousand and nine 
beatable 
where to get seventy seven thousand eight sixty to seventy seven thousand eight sixty two becomes cookie efficient cookie fission and seventy seven thousand 
eight hundred and twenty two that seems right i'll go on cookie fission ok next thirty and fifty seven squared which three thousand two hundred and forty nine so i can say three billion take the two forty nine and they have to cookie to forty nine weeks but i carry coming to forty nine and they have to cookie to fifty plus seventy seven three hundred and twenty seven million fish and fish and ok finally we do thick eighty three square that seven hundred times 
for something weird 
four hundred and sixty six thousand and four eighty nine rubber 
if i needed rubber 
sixty six 
so my was trying to explain something to me about grandma when they grew up and i couldn't pay attention to her because i was five years old and i was petrified 
i had just seen the green lady 
about a week earlier i watch that movie godzilla the one about that huge lizard like the storming a major city and the thought of a green monster coming from he was stuck in my mind 
there i was at a table lower manhattan with my mom just staring her horns her muscles all of which is frightened 
i didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero 
so i decided to consult the google have a day 
applause 
my mother explained at the green lady is actually the statue of liberty and as she was waving immigrants in 
the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head was the fact that according to my long before us the green lady was actually brown brown like me and that she changed colors over the years now much like america 
another part that really is intriguing about this is that when she changed color she made me think about myself 
it all made sense to me because of the first generation american i was surrounded by immigrants 
in fact within my immediate social circle of the people who support me who enriched my life at least two are foreign born 
in my life as a us citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers and chances are so is yours 
there are more than forty million immigrants in the usa 
according to census data a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign born parents 
i know all these statistics because i study global migration patterns 
woman journalist and for the last few years i've been documenting the lives of us citizens who had lost people to deportation 
the numbers are enormous 
from two thousand and eight to two thousand and sixteen more than three million people were ordered removed that's the technical term for being deported 
isn't economic or political and psychological and an emotional cost to those deportations the moments when these circles are broken 
once asked a u s soldier why did you volunteer to fight this war 
and she told me because i'm proud to defend my country 
but i press in a really when you're on base and you hear bombs exploding in the distance and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured in that moment when you know you could be next what does my country 
she looked at me my country is my wife my family my friends my soldiers what she was telling me that my country's the collection of the strong relationships these social circles 
when the social circles are weakened a country itself is weaker 
we're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy 
rather than focusing on individuals we should focus on the circles around them because these are the people who are left behind the voters the taxpayers the ones who are suffering that loss 
and it's not just the children are deported who were impacted 
brothers and sisters were separated by borders 
classmates teachers law enforcement officers technologists scientists doctors were all scrambling to make sense of new realities when their social circles are broken 
these are the real lives behind all these statistics that dominate discussions about immigration policy 
we often think about them 
i'm trying to change that 
use just one of the real life stories and i had collected 
still haunts me 
i met ramon and his son in two thousand and sixteen the same year both of them were being ordered out of the country 
ramon was being deported to latin america while his son who was a sergeant u s military was being deployed deported deployed if you just look at ramones case it wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is 
but consider a son a us citizen defending a country that's vanished as fun 
social circles which key here 
it 's another example that illustrates this critical bonds a group of citizens in philadelphia were concerned about their jobs because the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked was an undocumented immigrants and immigration officials had picked him up 
rally behind him 
immigration law he argued he was too important to local community to be deported 
at the hearing they even submitted restaurant reviews restaurant reviews 
in the end a judge exercise what's called judicial discretion and allow him to stay in the country but only because they considered the social circle 
there are twenty three million non citizens in the usa according to verifiable federal data 
that doesn't include the undocumented because numbers of that population are at best a complex estimates 
delicious work with what we have 
twenty three million social circles about one hundred million individuals whose lives can be impacted by deportation 
the stress of it all this trickling down to the population 
in two thousand and seventeen pole by u c l l a county residents found that thirty percent of citizens in l a county or stressed about deportation not because they themselves can be removed but rather because members of their social circle were at risk 
i am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported don't confuse name 
but what i am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture 
if you are within the sound of my voice i want you to close your eyes for a moment and examine your own social circle 
we are foreign born 
what would it feel like if the circle were broken 
share your story and building a global archive of first person accounts and linking them with mapping technology so that we can see exactly where the circles break because this is not just an american issue 
there are a quarter billion migrants around the world people living loving and learning in countries where they were not born 
my career and my life i've been one of them in china in africa in europe 
each time i become one of these foreigners one of the strange looking guy he's in a new land i can't help but think back to that day when i was in lower manhattan with my mom all those decades ago when i was scared and i had just spotted that green late 
i guess the question that i keep on thinking about when i see her and all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown and even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning as quite green when i look at all of that the question that my research seeks to answer becomes to me the same one that confounded me all those years ago you see a monster or a hero 
banking 

seven years ago i found myself high than in a festival toilet a music festival toilet and if anyone being to music festival yet you'll know that by the third day is pretty nasty 
diamond and in the toilet because i couldn't even sit down because the toilet roll it ran out there with mud everywhere and smelled pretty bad 
i stood there thinking what am i doing 
i don't even need to totally left 
but the reason i went with because island volunteer and for a large charity on climate justice and it was seven years ago when lots of people didn't believe in climate change people are very cynical about act with them and my role with all my team mates with to get people to sign petitions on climate justice and educate them a bit more about the issue 
i care deeply about climate change and lots of inequality so i go and i talked a lot of people which made me nervous and drained me of energy but i did it because i had what i would hide in the toilet because i'd be exhausted and i didn't want my teammates down and my commitment to the cause thing 
we go and meet at the end of our shift and we count how many petitions had been signed and often i'd when the amount of petition find even though i had my little breaks in the toilet 
but i was always very jealous of the other activists because either they had the same amount of energy as i had when they began to shift of getting people to sign petitions or often they had more energy and then be really excited about going to watch the band in the evening and have done 
even if i loved the band's all i wanted to do was to go back to my hands and half asleep because i just feel completely wiped out and i was really jealous of people have the energy to get one party hard at the festival 
but it also made me really angry as while inside 
i thought this isn't fair i'm an incorrect and all of that offline campaign and seems to be favor an extra that i would go on marches which training 
the other option 
go and join in campaigns outside embassies or shops 
but the only thing that with an affair with around lots of people it was very loud activism always involved lots of people it was performing 
and non event with their introverts and i not only thought that that wasn't fair because a third to a half of the world's population introvert which isn't fair on them because we'd ban out all would be put off by activism and not do it i'm everyone needs to be an actress in this world 
and also i didn't think it was particularly clever but i could see a lot of the activism that worked wasn't only extrovert activism 
it wasn't only the loud 
it wasn't about people perform and all the time 
i love the work that was needed within the background with hidden wasn't theme 
when i ended up just be in a campaign i couldn't see any job i can do really i was campaign and a university and for the last ten years i've been a professional campaigner for large charities and now i'm a creative campaigner consultants for different charities as well as other work i do but i knew that there were other forms of activism that when needed i started tinkering about seven years ago to see what quieter forms of activism i could engage with that i didn't pan out as an activist but also to look at some of the issues i was concerned about and campaign 
it was very lucky that when i worked for oxfam and make charities that i could read lots of big reports on what influenced politicians and businesses and general public what campaigns worked really well which didn't 
become a bit of a geek so i look at all of that stuff and i wanted to tinker around to see how i could engage people in social change in a different way because i think that if we want the world to me more beautiful kind and just than our activism should be beautiful kind and just and often it now 
today i just want to talk about three ways i think activism needs in tibet 
i think there's lots of other ways but i'm just gonna talk about three 
fast line is activism is often very quick and it's about doing so extra that often their immediate response to injustices we've got to do stuff now we've got to react really quickly and yes we do need to react but we need to be strategic in our campaign and and if we just act on anger often we do the wrong thing 
i use craft like needle whack like this guy behind me stolen as a way to not any slowed down those extra that day with but also to bring gain nervous quiet in tibet into activism 
why do and repetitive actions like handicraft he can't do it fast you have to do it slowly 
repetitive stitches help you meditate on the big complex messy social change issues and figure out what we can do as well as a citizen as the consumer as a constituent and all of those different things 
it helps you think critically while you're away and it helps you be more mindful of what do 
that bobby a whack it was mentioned before 
you about joined them people in solidarity or do you want to be the saviour which often isn't very ethical 
but do a needle work together as well extra vets and invent an army that everyone's on a scale in different places because it took a quiet slow former activism it really helps into that we had in the ways in other areas where they are often not have so because 
but while you itch and you don't need eye contact with people 
sofa nervous into that it means that you can sit next to someone or a group of people i'm asked questions that you're thinking that often at time to ask people owner too nervous to ask if you give to my contacts 
so you can get intervention with those big deep thinkers and that's really interested in you want to do that extra form of activism and it's about shame and people or quickly go out somewhere but who he tried to target and how is the best way to do it so it means you can have these discussions in a very slow way which is great for the extra bed to slow down and think deeply but it's really good for the end of act as well to be had and feel part of that movement for change and a good way 
some ways we do to stitch cards about what values we threads that a lot activism and making sure that we don't just react in unethical ways 
one sometimes we work with our institutions where it will get over one hundred and fifty people in the dna who can come for hours to stitch together on a particular issue and then tweets what they think i know how it went like this one 
also i always think that activate them needs introverts because we're really good at intimate activism 
couldn't slow activism and we're really good at intimate act with them and if this year's told us anything it's told us that we need to when we're engaged in power holders we need to engage them by listening to people we disagree with by building bridges not was walls are laws and by being critical friends not aggressive enemies 
one example that i do a lot with introverts but with lots of people is make gifts for people in power should not be outside scream and them but could give them something like a bespoke handkerchief saying don't lie way 
fusion power for good 
we know you've got a difficult job in your position of power how can we help you and what's great is for the into that we can write letters while we're making these gifts thrills marks and spencer we tried to campaign to get them to implement the living wage 
so he made them all the board members fourteen 
we wrote them letters we bucks them up and we went to the age yam to hand deliver our gifts and have that form of income activism where we had discussions with them 
what was brilliant with the chairman of the boards told us how amazed and our campaign was how heartfelt it was 
the board members like mark a lane fox who has hundreds and thousands of followers on twitter and highly influential in business tweeted impress she wants and within ten months we had meetings with marks and spencer to say we know this is difficult to be eleven wage employer but if you can be won the rest of the sector will look at it and it's not right that some of your amazed and whack whack and full time and still can't pay their bills and we look marks and spencer is how can you be the road muddled that we want you to be 
so intimate form of activism 
we had lots of meetings with meet with them 
we then gave them christmas cards and valentines gods decided we really want to encourage you to implement and live in wage and within ten months they denounce to the media that they were going to pay the independent living wage and now 
applause 

now we're trying to work with them to be accredited which is really important and we went back to the last day of yemenis june and we had these amaze and one to one discussions with the board members he told us how much they love their hankies and how it rarely move them what we were doing and they all told us that if he was standing outside scream at them and not be in gentle and protest they wouldn't have even listen to us never mind has these discussions with us 
internet some really good at intimate activism because we like to listen we light one ones we don't like small talks like those big juicy issues to discuss with people we don't like conflict so we avoid at all costs which is really important when we're trying to engage power holders not to be conflict and with all the time 
that 's why i think activists are really really miss out if they don't engage in tibet is the introverts like i said can be half of the world's population and may still as won't say that we're introverts are we get embarrassed by science was overwhelmed 
so for me a few years ago my mum used to semi texts in capital letters and she can now do images and everything she's fine but as soon as i see this tech and when i think oh it's capital is it's too much and i'd have to ignore it to be the lovely kept sheath and me 
that has been embarrassing to tell people that capital letters overwhelm you but we really need internet the helpers to intriguing activism that attracts them rather than puts them off 
we put off by big and brush giant posters in capital letters an exclamation marks countless what to do and vying for our attention 
some of the things i do with people around the world who take part is make small bits of provocative street art which are hung a high level very small and their provocative messages 
cannot preach and people are telling them what to do 
just getting people to engage in different ways and think for themselves because we don't like to be told what to do 
it might be wearing a green heart on your sleeve say and what you love and how climate change will affect day and will wear and if people say why are you wearing a green heart with the workshop clown and we can have these onto one intimate conversations and say i love chocolate 
climate change is going to effect day and i think there's lots of things that climate change will affect and i really want to make sure i'm part of the solution not the problem and then we normally to flex because we don't like to be center of attention and sidewalk to you love and how the climate change effects 
it might be shut drop in instead of shoplift and where will make little many scrolls were lovely stories on about what's the story behind your clothes 
a joyful story of how it's made or a tortuous one 
struck them and little pockets and shops all lower case all handwritten with kisses and smiley faces in robin and then people are excited that they found it 
we often drop him an unethical shop or in people in front pocket and it's a way that we can do offline campaign and that engages all the band is out but also engages people and intrigued and white online and offline 
so i've got to call to action for the internet and the extra bed 
the new that you're involved an old way 
with the extra that i want to say that when you're planning a campaign think about introverts 
think about how valuable skills are just as much as extra bed 
we 're good at slowing down and think and deeply and the detail of issues that really good at bringing in the mouth 
what good an intimate activism so users in that way 
could the intrigue and people by doing strange little things that help create conversations 
for that my calls for action for you is i know you like the and on your own i know you've been in your head but activism knee jew sometimes you've got to get out 
it doesn't mean that you've got a pan into an extra that and burnout because that's no use for anyone but what it does mean is that you should value the skills and the traits that you have the activities will need 
so for our industry where you in that spirit or an internet or an avenue that the world needs now more than ever and you've got no excuse not to get involved 
bank 

i would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature 
so i had my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation that as looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning and then following it up and try to understand 
one of the questions that i asked you when you look around what do you see 
well you see the space that's created by designers and by then the work of people but what you actually see a lot of material that was already here being reshaped and a certain form 
so the question is how did that material get here 
how did they get into the form it had before it got reshape and so forth 
it's a question of what's the continuity 
one of the things i look at is how did the universe began and shape 
what was the whole process and the creation and the evolution of the universe to getting to the point that we have these kind of material 
so that's sort of apart and let me move on then show you the hubble ultra deep field 
if you look at this picture what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it 
everything but for these objects are stars and you can see them their little pluses 
this is a star this is a star everything else was a galaxy 
a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye on here 
when i look out and particularly this galaxy which looks a lot like ours i wonder if there's an art design college conference going on and an intelligent beings they are thinking about what designs i might do and there might be a few cosmologists trying to understand where the universe itself came from and they might even be some on that galaxy looking at hours trying to figure out what's going on over here 
but there's a lot of other galaxies in summer nearby and they're kind of the color of the sun and some are further away and though there are a little bluer and so forth 
but one of the questions is that should be to you how can there are so many galaxies 
because this represents a very tiny fraction of the sky 
is only 
biologists we think there's on the order visible to the hubble space telescope if he had the time the scattered around about one hundred billion galaxies it's a very large number 
that's abruptly how many stars they're on our own galaxy 
but when you look at some of these regions like this you'll see more galaxies and stars which is kind of a conundrum 
so the question should come to your mind is what kind of design what kind of creative process and what kind of design produced the world like that 
then i'm going to tell you it's actually a lot more complicated 
we're going to try and follow it up 
we have a tool that actually helps us out in the study and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big that it's a time machine and a certain sense 
we draw the set of nested spheres cutaway sixty 
put the earth at the center of the nested spheres just because that's where we're making observations 
when the moon is only two seconds away so if you take a picture of the moon using ordinary like the moon two seconds ago and who cares 
few seconds like the present the scientists eight minutes ago 
but that's not such a big deal unless a solar flares coming you want to get out of the way 
if you'd like to have advanced 
but you get out the jupiter and its forty minutes away it's a problem 
about mars it's a problem communicating to mars because it takes a long enough to go there 
but if you look at the nearest set of stars so the nearest forty or fifty stars it's about ten years 
take a picture of what's going on it's ten years ago 
what you go and looked at the center of the galaxy is thousands of years ago 
we look at andromeda which is the nearest big galaxy and as two million years ago 
if you took a picture of the earth two million years ago there would be no evidence of humans at all because we don't think they were humans yet 
it gives you the scale 
with the hubble space telescope were looking out hundreds of millions of years two billion years 
but if we were capable to come up with an idea how to look even further to send things even further and that was what i did a lot of my work was to develop the techniques that we could look out back even earlier epochs before they were star than before there were galaxies back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different 
so that's the sort of sequence and so i have a more artistic impression of this 
whereas the galaxy in the middle which is the milky way and around that are the hubble nearby galaxies and there's a sphere that marks the different times 
behind that are some more modern galaxies 
we see the whole big picture 
in the beginning of time it's funny it's on the outside 
then there's a part of the universe we can't see because it's so dense and so hot light cannot escape 
fletke can't see that the center of the sun you'd have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside of the sun 
but you can see the edge of the sun and the universe gets that way you can see that 
then you see this sort of model area around the outside and that is the radiation coming from the big bang which is actually incredibly uniform 
the universe is almost a perfect sphere but there are these very tiny variations which we show here and create exaggeration 
from them and the time sequence we're going to have to go from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and stars to these more advanced galaxies and eventually the solar systems and software 
so it's a big design job but we will see about how things are going on 
so the way this measurements were done it's been a set of satellites and this is where you get to see 
so there was the kogi satellite which was launched in one hundred and eighty nine and we discover these variations 
then in two thousand the map satellite was launched the w map and made somewhat better pictures 
later this year this is the cool stealth version the one that actually has some beautiful design teachers to it and they said that the planck satellite will be launched and it will make very high resolution maps 
that will be the sequence of understanding the very beginning of the universe 
what we saw it as we saw these variations and then they told us the secrets both about the structure of space time and about the contents of the universe and about how the universe started in its original motion 
so we have this picture which is quite spectacular picture and i'll come back to the beginning where we're going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning 
we go through a period of accelerating expansion and the universe expands and cools and so it gets to the point where it becomes transparent that into the dark ages and then the first stars turn on and they evolve into galaxies and later they get to the more expansive galaxies 
somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming 
and it's maturing up to the present time 
since protect your things 
wastebasket part that's the represent what the structure of space time itself is doing during this period and so this is a pretty weird model 
what kind of evidence we have for that 
so let me show you some of nature's patterns that a result of this 
i always think of space time as being the real substance of space and the galaxies and stars just like the film on the ocean it's a marker of where they were the interesting ways are and whatever went out 
so here is the sloan digital sky survey showing the location of a million galaxies 
dot on here for every galaxy 
go out and when a telescope at the sky take a picture identify what are stars and throw them away look at the galaxies estimate how far away they are and plot them up and just put radially they're going out that way and you see these structures this thing we call the great wall and but there are voids and those kind of stuff and they kind of fade out because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it 
i'm going to show you this in three d 
what happens is you take pictures of the earth rotates should get a fan across the sky 
some places you can't look because of our own galaxy or because there are no telescopes available to do it 
so the next picture shows you the three dimensional version of this rotating around 
and you see the fan like scans made across the sky 
remember every spot on here is a galaxy and you see the galaxies you know sort of in our neighborhood and you start to see the structure 
when you see this thing we call the great wall and you see the complicated structure and you see these boys 
there are places where there are no galaxies and there are places where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together 
so there's an interesting pattern but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern 
we only have a million galaxies 
keeping like a million balls in the air but you know what's going on 
but there's another survey which is very similar this call it the tedious the two degree field of view galaxy redshift survey 
going to fly through it at warp a million 
every time there's a galaxy and its location there's a galaxy and we know if we know anything about the galaxy which you do it because there's a redshift measurement everything you put it in the type of galaxy and the color so this is the real representation 
when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern it's like being in the middle of life 
it 's hard to see the middle of the audience and started to see the pattern of 
so we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this 
you will see the first the structure of the survey that you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there so again you can see the extension of this great wall of galaxies showing up here 
but you can see the voyage you can see that the complicated structure and you say well how did this happen right suppose you're the catholic designer 
how are you going to put galaxies out there and a pattern like that 
it's not just throwing them out at random 
a more complicated process going on here 
how are you going to end up doing that 
so now we're in for some serious play 
we have to seriously play god not just change people's lives but make the universe 
so if that's your responsibility how are you going to do that 
what's the kind of techniques 
with the kind of thing going to do so i'm going to show you the results of a very large scale simulation of what we think the universe might be like using essentially some of the play principles and some of the design principles that that humans have labor so hard to pick up but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning 
and that is you start out with very simple ingredients and some simple rules and that you have to have enough ingredients to make a complicated 
then you put in some randomness and fluctuations of the randomness and realize a whole bunch of different representations 
so what i'm going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales 
we're going to zoom in that this is a platter of what it is and we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right 
dark matter that is matter that doesn't interact with light the typical way the ordinary matter does the way that light shining on me or on the stage 
it's transparent to light but in order for you to see it we're going to make it white so the stuff that in this picture that's white that it is the dark matter 
it should be called invisible matter of the dark matter made visible 
stuff that is in the yellow color that is the ordinary matter it's turned into stars and galaxies 
so i'll show you the next movie so this we're going to zoom in and notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern 
we're going to zoom in and zoom in 
you'll see they're all these filaments and structures and voids 
when a not a number of filaments come together and no not that makes a supercluster of galaxies 
one we're zooming in on the somewhere between one hundred thousand and a million galaxies and small 
region so we live in the boonies we don't live in the center of the solar system we don't live in center of the galaxy and our galaxy's not in the center of 
this is a region which probably has more than one hundred thousand on the order of a million galaxies in that region we're going to keep zooming in and so i forgot to tell you 
scale parsec as three point two six 
so a gigaparsec says three billion light years that's the scale 
so it takes light three billion years to travel over that 
an hour into the distance between here and here 
between us and andromeda right 
these little specks that you're seeing their galaxies 
we're going to zoom back out and you can see this this structure that when we get very far out looks very regular but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations 
simple building block 
it 's a very simple fluid that begin with 
it got dark matter that ordinary matter it's got photons and it's got neutrinos which don't play much role in the later part of the universe 
and it's just a simple fluid and it into overtime develops into this complicated structure 
so now when you first saw this picture didn't mean quite so much to you 
here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe and you're seeing billions of galaxies and nodes but you realize they're not even the main structure 
a framework which is the dark matter the invisible matter that's out there that's actually holding it altogether 
so let's fly through it and you can see how much harder it is when you're in the middle of something to figure this out 
so here's that same result 
a filament you see the light is invisible matter and a yellow as the stars and galaxies showing up 
and we're going to fly around and will fly around and you'll see some occasionally a couple of filaments intersect and you get a large cluster of galaxies and then we'll fly and wherever the very large clusters and you can see what it looks like 
so from inside it doesn't look very complicated 
only when you look at another really large scale and explored and so forth he realized it's a very intricate complicated kind of a design 
has grown up in a in some kind of way 
so the question is how hard would it be to assemble this right 
how many have been contractor team would you need to put this universe together 
that's an issue 
so here we are 
we see how the filament you see how several filaments are coming together therefore making this the supercluster of galaxies 
when you have to understand this is not how it actually look at first you can't travel as fast but like everything will be distorted but this is using simple rendering graphic arts kind of stuff 
this is how if you took billions of years to go around it might look to you 
you could see invisible matter too 
so the idea is you know how would you put together the universe in a very simple way 
we're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe everything we can see in every direction with the hubble space telescope plus or other instruments was once in a region that was smaller than an atom 
it started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations but expanding at a tremendous rate 
those fluctuations were stretched to astronomical sizes and those fluctuations eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background 
then we need some way to turn those fluctuations and the galaxies and clusters of galaxies and to make these kind of structure go on 
so i'm going to show you a smaller simulation 
simulation was run on one thousand processors for a month in order to make just a simple visit one so i'm going to show you one that can be run on a desktop and two days in the next 
picture so you start out with teeny fluctuations when the universe was at this point now four times smaller than 
you start seeing these networks this cosmic web structure forming 
this is a simple one because it doesn't have the ordinary matter and it just as the dark matter and 
when you see how the dark matter lumps up and the ordinary matter just trails along behind so there it is 
but at the beginning it's very uniform 
fluctuations are a part of one hundred 
to a few peaks that are part of ten thousand and then over billions of years gravity just 
polls and there's a slight over density pulls the material around in that pulls and more material than it was 
but the distances on the universe is so large and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form 
it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size that is now and in terms of expansion 
at that point the universe mysteriously starts accelerating expansion and cuts off the formation of larger scale structure 
so we're just seeing as large scale structure we can see and then the only things that are started forming already are going to form then from then on what's going to go on 
so we're able to this simulation but this is two days on a laptop and desktop 
we need thirty days on one thousand processors to do that kind of simulations show 
before so we have an idea of how to play seriously it created the universe by starting with essentially less than an eyedropper material right and we create everything we can see in any direction from almost nothing that is something extremely tiny extremely small and it is almost perfect except that had these tiny fluctuations that apart one hundred thousand level which turn out that produced the interesting patterns and designed to see that as galaxies and stars 
before so we have a model and we can calculate it and we can use it to make designs that what we think the universe really 
that design is sort of way beyond what our original imagination of her was 
so this is what we started with fifteen years ago with the cosmic background explorer may made the map and the upper right which basically showed us that there were large scale fluctuations and actually fluctuations on several scales you can kind of see that 
since then we've had w map which gives us hiring a resolution 
we see the same large scale structure will we see additional small scale structure 
on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down and map the earth what kind of map we've gotten the earth 
and you could see well you can kind of pick out a major continents but that's about it 
what we're hoping when we get the planck will have resolution about equivalent to the resolution of the earth there where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the earth 
you can also tell because of the sharp edges and the way things fit together there's some non linear processes 
geology has these effects in which is moving the plates around and so forth 
you can see that just from the map alone 
we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non linear effects that are starting to move to modify and it gives us a hint about how space time itself was actually created at the beginning moments 
so that's where we are today and that that's what i wanted to give you a flavor 
it gives you a different view about what the design and whatever area where everything else looks like thank you 
clearly we are living in a moment of crisis 
arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us and yet i stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there's probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive 
because some of the technologies we've been talking about 
because of the resources the skills and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world but the mindset to create change 
and we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world 
by definition every one of you who was in this room and must consider yourself a global for a global citizen 
work on the front line 
when you've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another 
no matter what country you live or work in move off the thing the extraordinary thing of individuals are capable of even in the most ordinary now 
today there's a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty have that we release their energy 
on the one hand we have people that day the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out 
on the other we have people who say the problem is we need more aid 
want to talk about is something that complements both systems 
we call it patient capital 
the critic point to the five hundred billion dollars spent in africa thin nine hundred and seventy and say and what do we have it environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty rampant corruption 
and use mobuto as metaphor 
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable focus on the capital markets in that don't give anything away 
if on the other side as i said there are those who say the problem is that we need more money 
when it comes to the rich will bail out my hand a lot of aid but when it comes to our poor brethren we want little to do with it 
pointed with exactly the way the eradication of smallpox and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and anti retroviral 
both sides are right 
the problem is that neither side of listening to the other 
even more problematic they're not listening to poor people themselves 
for twenty five years of working on issues of poverty and of innovation it's true that there are probably no more market oriented individuals on the planet than low income people 
must navigate market daily making micro decisions talented and dozens to move their way through society and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family they could be put back into poverty sometimes for generations 
we need both the market and we need aid 
patient capital works between and tries to take the best of both 
money invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and our building solutions to healthcare water housing alternative energy thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity but as individual customers consumers client people who want to make decisions in their own lives 
patient capital required that we have incredible tolerance for risk a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment to use the market will bear listening device that we have and the expectation of below market returns but outside social impact 
it recognizes that the market has its limitations and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people 
entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons 
first they tend to work in markets where people make one two three dollars a day and they're making all of their decisions within that income level 
second the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure no roads to speak of sporadic electricity in high levels of corruption 
third they are often creating market 
even if you're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages it is something new 
so many low income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time takes a lot of patience 
it also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance 
and not only to build the systems the business model that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way but to connect those businesses to other market to governments to corporations real partnership if we want to get scared 
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation 
in two thousand and two i met with incredible entrepreneur named omni cabot the dangling from india has been working for twenty years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet 
he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low income farmers altogether despite the fact that two hundred million farmers alone in india and make under a dollar a day 
were creating subsidies either for large farms or they will giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use rather than that the farmers wanted to use 
but at the same time i'm macabre was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in israel 
it was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stock of the plant 
it could transform swaths of desert land into fields with emerald green 
but the market also had bypassed low income farmers because the systems were both too expensive and they were constructed for fields that were too large 
the average smallholder farmer works on two acres or less 
so i decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves because he had spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have 
used three fundamental principles 
the first one with miniatures ization the drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre even if he had to because it was too frightening given all that he had at stake 
second it had to be extremely affordable 
in other words that risk i'm a quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest or else they wouldn't take the risk 
third it had to be what amitabha calls infinitely expandable 
what i mean it with the profits from the first quarter acre the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth 
today i e india army cabins organization has sold over three hundred thousand farmers these systems and have seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average but this didn't happen 
overnight in fact when you go back to the beginning there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk and building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day that were known to be some of the most risk averse people on the planet and that we're working in the riskiest sectors 
we needed grant 
youth significant grant to research to experiment to fail to innovate and try again 
when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers that one patient capital could come in 
we helped him build a company for profit that would build on either eat knowledge and start looking at fail and export and be able to tap into other kinds of capital 
secondarily we wanted to see if we can export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries 
and so we met doctor sono khangharani in pakistan 
while again you needed patient to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan just to get a permit over time we were able to start a company with with doctor sono who runs a large community development organization and the tar desert which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country 
that company has just started our assumption is that they are too will see the impact on millions 
but drip irrigation isn't the only innovation 
we're starting to feed the happening all around the world 
the aleutian tanzania aided that textile manufacturing has worked in partnership with us with unicef with the global fund to create a factory that now employs seven thousand people mostly 
women and they produce twenty million lifesaving bednets for africans around them 
bring hospital as a joint venture between acumen and the government of india to bring quality affordable and maternal health care the low income women have been sloth the federal building new hospital every thirty five day 
by an ambulance crew decided that it was going to we invent a completely broken industry building an ambulance service in bombay that would use the technology of google earth a sliding scale frightening them so that all people could have access and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption 
so that in the terrorist attacks of november they were the first responder and are now beginning to fail because of partnership 
save just one for government contracts to build up their one hundred ambulances and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in india 
idea fail is critical 
because we're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people 
of the one side effects have reached at least a quarter million people 
but that abruptly not enough 
where the idea of partnership becomes so important 
whether it's by finding those innovations that can access the capital market government itself or partner with major corporation there's unbelievable opportunity for innovation 
president obama understands that he recently authorized the creation of a social innovation fund to focus on what works in this country and look at how we can scale 
i would submit that it's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really had innovations not only for their country but ones that we can use in the developed world as well 
best financial assistance but also management assistance 
then measure the returns both from a financial perspective and social impact perspective 
when we think about new approaches to aid it's impossible not to talk about pakistan 
we kind of rocky relationship with that country and in all fairness the united states has not always been a very reliable partner 
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things happen 
if we take that notion of a global innovation fund we could use this time to invest not directly in government but we would have government's blessing nor in international experts but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovation that are reaching people all across the country 
people like russian is often who created one of the largest microfinance bank in the country and the real role model for women inside and outside the country 
path named the geeky to develop the way called incremental housing and where he's moved forty thousand slum dwellers interfaith affordable communities 
housing educational initiatives like do and the citizen foundation that are building schools across 
not hyperbole to say that the civil society institutions and the social entrepreneurs are belgian real alternatives to the taliban 
it has been invested in pakistan for over seven years now and for those of you who worked there in a cast the pakistanis are incredibly hard working population and there's a fierce upward mobility in their very nature 
president kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable 
i would say that the converse is true 
that these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the seventy percent of pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day provide real pathways to hope 
as we think about how we construct aid for pakistan while we need to strengthen the judiciary build greater stability we also need to think about lifting both leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world 
one of my life that is to pakistan i asked doctor sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the car desert 
we left karachi one morning before dawn 
it was about one hundred and fifteen degrees 
we drove for eight hours along the moon date like landscape with color lots of heat very little discussion because we were exhausted 
and finally at the end of the journey i could see the thin little yellow line across the horizon 
and as we got closer at significant became apparent 
there and together was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall 
because one of the poorest farmers on earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life 
his name was rogen and he had kind twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me and my father 
instead it with the first dry season in his entire life that he hadn't taken his twelve children and grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about fifty cents a day 
because he was building these problems 
with the money earned he could stay this year 
for the first time ever in three generations his children will go to school 
we asked him if he was sent his daughters as well as for fun 
he said of course i will 
because i don't want them discriminated against anymore when we think about solutions to poverty we cannot deny individuals their fundamental dignity 
because at the end of the day dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth and what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity 
because that's where dignity really start 
martin luther king said that love without power is anemic and sentimental and that power without love is reckless and abusive 
generation has seen both approaches tried and often fail 
but i think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power 
for that is what will need as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really cake to build a global economy that includes all of us and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet 
the kind graft to begin innovating and looking for new solutions across sector is now 
i can only talk for my own experience but in eight years of running acumen fund i've seen the power of patient capital 
not only to inspire innovation and risk taking but to truly build systems that have created more than twenty five thousand jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on 
planet i know 
but i know that many other kinds of innovation also work 
and so i urge you in whatever sector you work and whatever job you do to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those were trying to help rather than what we think that they might need 
it will take embracing the world with both arms 
it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability with a sense of integrity and perseverance 
these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generation 
there are so much good that we can do 
just think of other sunflowers in the desert 
banking 
one of the things that define a tedster is you've taken your passion and you've turned into stewardship 
we actually put action to the issues you care about 
but what you're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out 
so how do you do that 
one of the things i should probably tell you is i worked for the discovery channel early in my career and that sort of warped my framework 
so when you start to think about politicians you've got to realize these are strange creatures 
other than the fact that they can't tell directions and have very strange breeding habits how do you actually work with these things what we need to understand is what drives the political creature 
and there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart one his reputation and influence 
so these are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job 
the second one unlike most animals which is survival of the species this is preservation of self 
you may think it's money but that's actually sort of a proxy to what i can do to preserve myself 
the challenge with you moving your issue forward as these animals are getting broadcast to all the time 
so what doesn't work in terms of getting your issue to be important 
you can send them an email well unfortunately i've got so many viagra ads coming at me your email is lost 
it doesn't matter it's spam 
you get on the phone while chances are gonna droid who is picking up the phone and yes they called and they said they didn't like it that doesn't move 
face to face would work but it's hard to set it up 
and it's hard to get the context and actually get communication to work 
yes contributions actually do make a difference and they said a context for having a conversation but to take some time to build up 
so what actually works and the answer is rather strange 
a letter 
we live in a digital world but we're fairly analog creatures letters actually work even the top dog himself takes time every day to read ten letters that are picked up by staff 
i can tell you that every official that i've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean 
so how are you going to write your letter 
first of all you're going to pick up an analog device a pen 
i know these are tough and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it but this is actually critical 
and it is critical that you actually hand write your letter it is so novel to see this that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me 
second of all i'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month 
my promise to you if you are consistent and do this within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and says what do you think 
going to give you a four paragraph format to work with 
now when you approach these animals you need to understand there is a dangerous and to them and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness 
so in paragraph number one what i'm going to tell you to do is very simply this t appreciate 
you may not appreciate the person you may not appreciate anything else for maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough game 
when animals are going to make a point they make the point 
they don't spend a lot of time around 
so here you go paragraph number two you may actually have to just get very blunt and say what's really on your mind 
when you do this don't attack people you attack tactics 
hominem attacks will get you nowhere 
paragraph number three when animals are attacked or cornered they will fight to the death so you have to give them an exit 
for most of the time that they have an exit strategy they should take it obviously your intelligence 
if you had the right information you would have done the right thing lastly you want to be the nurturing agent 
your the safe place to come into someone paragraph number for a you're gonna tell people if no one is providing information let me help 
animals do displays they do two things they warn you or they try to attract you and say we need to mate you're going to do that by the way you sign your letter 
do a number of things you're a vice president you volunteer you do something else 
why is this important 
because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature that you have influence in a large sphere and that my preservation depends on you 
is one very quick hack especially for the feds in the audience 
and here's how your mail your letter 
first of all you send the original to the district office to send a copy to the main office 
if we follow protocol to pick up the phone and say hey do you had the original then some droid the back puts name on a particular and says oh this is an important letter and you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read 
so what your letter means i've got to tell you we are all in a party and political officials are the we are harangued lectured to sold marketed but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication 
i got this letter when i was first elected and i still carried to every council meeting i go to 
this is an opportunity at real dialogue and if you have stewardship and want to communicate that dialogue is incredibly powerful 
so when you do that here's what i can promise you're going to be the eight hundred pound gorilla in the forest 
kept writing 

presentation needs this slide in it it's beautiful isn't it you see all the points alder all the lines it's incredible it is the network and in my case the network has been important in media because i get to connect to people 
when the way that i've been doing it in multi faceted 
for example i get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners i put together projects like earth sandwich where i asked people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the earth 
and people started laying bread in tribute and eventually a team was able to do it between new zealand and spain it's pretty incredible the videos online 
connecting to people in projects like young minami for example 
young minami your audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult this is the same person top photo james bottom photo julia point this was a mother's day gift particularly creepy my favorite of these photos which i couldn't find is there is a picture of a thirty year old woman or so with a little baby on her lap and the next photo is two hundred and twenty lb man with a tiny little old lady peaking over his shoulder 
but this project change the way that i thought about connecting to people 
this is a project called ray 
what happened was i was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audience 
somebody said you have to have to listen to this and this is what came to me 
hi my name is re yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt were quite unfair 
being quite disturbed she called for comfort and i didn't really know what to tell her because we have to deal with so much mess in our society 
so i was led to write this song just for her to just give her some encouragement or are dealing with stress and pressure on her job 
i figured i'd put it on the internet for all employees are under stress to help you better deal with what you're going through your job 
have a song goes 
i 'm about to whip somebody's is 
so i'm about to whip somebody's the 
if you don't leave me alone 
we 're going to have to send me home 
cause i'm about to whip somebody's 
now you may not be able to sing that allow that you can have it to yourself and you know the words are 
it gives you some strength to get through the next few moments are on your job or stay strong peace 
so yeah 
rush 
we can heal quickly 
so i was so moved by this right this is incredible this was this was connecting right 
was at a distance realizing that someone was feeling something to wanting to to affect them in a particular way using media to do it putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact this was incredible this is what i wanted to do 
so the first thing i thought i was we have to thank him 
and i asked my audience i said listen to this piece of audio we have to remix and he's got a great voice 
but actually in the keys b flat and we have to do something with hundreds of remixes came back lots of different attempts 
one stood out in particular 
it was done by a guy named goose 


lives 
the i'm about to with the costs of doing the right so it was incredible that song 
so that song somebody told me that it was a baseball game in kansas city 
in the end it was it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services 
so i said let's put this together and an album the audience came together and they designed an album cover 
and i said if you put it all on this i'm going to deliver it to him if you can figure out who this person is because all i had was his name ray and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset 
two weeks they found him 
i received an email and said hi i'm re i heard you were looking for me and i was like yeah 
it has been an interesting two weeks so i flew to st louis and met ray and he's a preacher among other things 
but anyways here here's the thing because it reminds me of this which is a sign that you see in amsterdam on every street corner 
it 's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world 
i look at this photo and he seems really interested in what's going on with that button but it doesn't seem like he's really that interested in crossing the street and it makes me think of this 
on street corners everywhere people are looking at their cell phones and it's easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture 
but the truth is his life is being lived there 
when they smile you've seen people stop all of a sudden life has been lived there somewhere up in that weird dense network 
this is it right to feel and be felt 
the most fundamental fundamental force that we're all after 
we can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier but ultimately what we're trying to do is really connect with one other person 
and that's not always going to happen in physical space 
it's also going to happen in virtual spaces and we have to get better at figuring that out 
think of the people that build all this technology of the network a lot of them aren't very good at connecting with people 
this is kind of like something i used to do in third grade 

so here's a series of projects over the last few years where i've been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection 
sometimes they're very very simple things 
with childhood walk with a project where i asked people to remember a walk that they used to take the child over and over again that that was sort of meaningless like on the route to the bus stop to a neighbor's house and take it inside of google 
i promise you if you take that walk inside of google street view you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face 
i collected those moments the photos inside google streetview and the memories specifically our conversation started with me saying i'm bored and her replying when i'm bored i eat pretzels i remember this distinctly because it came up a lot right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom i remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola they use some of the morbidly artistic footage a close up of chad's shoes in the middle of the highway i guess the shoes came off when he was hit 
but my house once and he left his pillow it had chad written in magic marker on it he died long after he left the pillow at my house so we never get around to returning it sometimes they're a little bit more abstract 
this is pain pack 
bright after september eleventh last year i was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it the way that we excises it from our bodies 
so what i did as i opened up a hotline hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain not necessarily related to that event 
people called in and left messages like this 
he said 
i am 
really fortunate 
i fell in love 
even the smallest coming 
people think how an accident 
so what i did was i took those voicemails and with their permission converted them to mp three's and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those 
those were then distributed to djs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material we don't have time to play much as you can look at it online 
for two to forty eight with love was a project around the time of the last election cycle where mccain and obama both in their speeches after the election talked about reconciliation and i was like what the hell is that look like so i thought well let's just give it a try 
pilots have people hold up signs about reconciliation and so some really nice things came together i voted blue i voted read together for our future i voted this very very cute little things right 
some came from the winning party you're forty eight i promise to listen to fight for you to respect you always some came from the party who had just lost for forty eight fifty to meet your party's leadership be as classy as you but i doubt it but the truth was is as this started becoming popular a couple of right wing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing which i could also see 
so i started getting amazing amounts of heat male death threats even 
and he said i'm dressed as batman to hide my identity just in case i thought the real batman like coming after me what's actually going to give you a little better than him 
so what i did unfortunately it was hot harboring all this kind of like awful experience and this pain inside of me and it started to eat away at my psyche 
that was protecting the project from and i realized 
was protecting and i didn't want this special little group of photographs to get sullied in some ways 
so what i did i took all of those emails and i put them together into something called angrigami which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff 
i asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the angrigami but this was this was the emotional moment 
one of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of heat it's amazing 
the last thing i'm going to tell you about his is a series of projects called songs we already know where the idea was i was trying to figure out how to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects 
one of them was fairly straightforward 
guy said that his daughter got scared at night and can i write a song for his daughter 
and i said oh yeah i'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep and this was scared 
and this is a song that as saying something 
it gives me good 
where does this mean 
some 
cities towns 

he believes that the key chain 
listen 
ok so so i wrote that song thanking the nice thing was as he walked by his his daughter's room at some point and she was singing that song to herself 
so i was like awesome 
it was great 
then i got this there's a little bit of a backstory to this 
but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equals you where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person 
so i asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me 
i got a lot like thirty and a half an hour 
shut that part down 
i chose to people to be and i asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on facebook 
one person sent me a very detailed description the other person didn't 
the person who didn't it turned out had just moved to a new city and taken a new job 
so people were writing me and say how's your new job as a low 
but anyway this the same person laura ended up emailed me a little bit after that project 
and i felt badly for not having done a good job 
and she said i'm really anxious i just moved to the town i have this new job and i just have this incredible amount of anxiety so she'd seen the scared song and wondered if i could do something 
so i asked her what does it feel like when you feel this way and she's wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have this anxiety 
i said okay i'll think about it and so quietly in the background i started sending people this 

ok 
the 
so i asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities just so that he could sing along to the song with headphones on so i could just get their voices back 
this is the kind of thing that i got back 

key 
the 
so that's one of the better ones really 
it often is like as i started getting more and more and more of them all of a sudden i had thirty forty voices from around the world 
when you put them together something magical happens something absolutely incredible happens and all of a sudden a chorus from around the world 
what was really great is putting all this work together in the background and laura sent me a follow up email because a good month had passed by as he said i know you've forgotten about me 
just want to say thanks for even considering it and then a few days later as enter this 
for the day 
so yes 
shame 
seems like the spin 
standings 
maybe spam they can 
use

i grew up in a very small village in canada and i'm an undiagnosed dyslexic 
i had a really hard time in school 
in fact my mother told me eventually that i was a little kid in the village who cried all the way to school i ran away i'd left when i was twenty five years old to go to bali and there i met my incredible wife cynthia and together over twenty years we built an amazing jewelry business 
it was a fairytale and then we retire 
when she took me to see a film that i really didn't want to see 
ruined my life the inconvenient truth and mister gore 
for kids and even if part of what he says is true they are not going to have the life that i had 
i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities 
so here's the world and here we are in bali 
a tiny little island sixty miles by ninety miles 
has an intact hindu culture 
cynthia and i were there 
we had had a wonderful life there and we decided to do something unusual we decided to give back locally 
and here it is it's called the green school 
i know it doesn't look like a school but it is something we decided to do and it is extremely extremely green 
the classrooms have no walls 
the teacher is riding on a bamboo blackboard 
under desks are not square 
but green school the children are smiling and unusual thing for school especially for me 
we practice holism 
for me it's just the idea that if this little girl graduates as a whole person chances are she'll demand a whole world a whole world to live on 
by children spend one hundred and eighty one days going to school in a box 
the people they built my school also built the prison in the insane asylum out of the same materials 
so if this gentleman had have had a holistic education will be sitting there 
what he had had more possibilities in his life 
classrooms have natural light they are beautiful their bamboo the breeze passes through them 
when the natural breeze isn't enough the kids deploy bubbles but not the kind of bubbles you know 
so these bubbles are made from natural cotton and rubber from the rubber tree 
so we basically turn the box into a bubble 
these kids know that painless climate control may not be part of their future 
we pay the bill at the end of the month but the people that are really going to pay the bill or our grandchildren 
we have to teach the kids that the world is not indestructible 
these kids did a little graffiti on their desks and then they signed up for two extra courses 
the first one was called sanding and the second one was called the re waxing 
but since that happened they own those desks 
they know they can control their world 
on the grand were not proud of it but an amazing alternative energy company in paris is taking us off the grid with solar 
this thing is the second vortex to be built in the world in a two and a half meter drop on our river 
when the turbine drops in it will produce eight thousand watts of electricity day 
finite and you know what these 
there is nowhere to flush 
as long as we're taking our waste and mixing it with a huge amount of water you are all really smart just do the math 
how many people times how much water 
there isn't enough water 
so these are compost toilets and nobody at the school wanted to know about them especially the principal and they work people use them people are ok it's something you should think about doing 
not many things didn't work 
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun and six months 
we had to replace them with recyclable plastic 
with teachers drag giant pvc whiteboards into the classrooms 
so we had some good ideas we took all the automobile windshields put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whiteboard 
green school sits in south central bali and it's on twenty acres of rolling garden 
is an amazing river traveling through it and you can see there how we managed to get across the river 
i met her father the other day he looked a little crazy 
said welcome to green school he said i'd been on an airplane for twenty four hours i asked him why he said i had a dream once about a green school and i saw a picture of this green school i got on an airplane 
in august i'm bringing my son's this was a great thing 
but more than that people are building green houses around green school so that kids can walk to school on the paths 
people are bringing their green industries hopefully their green restaurants to the green school 
becoming a community 
becoming a green model 
we have to look at everything 
petrochemicals in the pavement no pavement these or volcanic stones laid by hand there are no sidewalks the sidewalks or gravel they fled when it rains but their green 
gould buffalo 
he 's playing to eat that fence for dinner 
while the fences at green school or green 
and when the kindergarten kids recently moved their gait they hand out the handsome man out of tapioca 
they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen slice them thinly and made delicious chips landscaping we managed to keep the garden was there running right up to the edge of each of the classroom 
we drop them gently in 
we made space for these guys who are balis last black pigs 
the school cow is trying to figure out how to replace the lawnmower on the playing field 
these young ladies are living in a rice culture but they know something that few people know in a rice culture 
how to plant organic rice they know how to look after it they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it 
for their part of the rice cycle and the skills will be valuable for them in their future 
this young man is picking organic vegetables 
within four hundred people lunch every day and it's not a normal lunch 
no gas 
local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers now 
the food is incredible 
green school is a place of pioneers local and global 
it 's a kind of microcosm of globalized world 
the kids are from twenty five countries 
when i see them together i know that they're working out how to live in the future 
green school is going into its third year with one hundred and sixty children 
school where you do learn reading one of my favorites writing i was bad at it arithmetic 
but you also learn other things 
we learned bamboo building 
you practice ancient balinese arts 
this is called mud wrestling in the rice fields the kids love it the mothers aren't quite convinced 

we 've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives and we said okay local what is local 
a local means that twenty percent of the population at the school has to be balinese and this was a really big committed 
we were right 
when people are coming forward from all over the world to support the balinese scholarship fund because these kids with balis next green leaders 
teachers are as diverse as the student body and the amazing thing is that volunteers are popping up 
a man came from java with a new kind of organic agriculture 
a woman came from africa with music 
together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global green leaders 
green school effect we don't know what it is 
we need someone to come and study it 
about what's happening are learning different kids dyslexic we rename them prolexic are doing really well in these beautiful beautiful classrooms 
all the kids are thriving 
how did we do all this on giant grass its bamboo it comes out of the ground like a train 
it grows as high as a coconut tree in two months and three years later it can be harvested the build buildings like this 
chess strong and dances peak and it will hold up any roof 
when the architects came they brought us these things and you've probably seen things like this 
a yellow box was called the administration complex we squashed it we rethought it but mainly we renamed it the heart of school and that changed everything forever 
a double helix 
it has administrators in it and many many other things 
balinese carpenters like this measured them with their bamboo rulers selected the bamboo and built the buildings using age old techniques mostly by hand it was chaos and the balinese carpenters wanted to be as modern as we do so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building and when the scaffolding came down we realized that we had a cathedral cathedral green and a cathedral to green education 
the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it 
from the time the foundations were finished in three months it had roofs and floors 
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world but many people believe that it's the most beautiful 
this doable in your community 
we believe it is 
green school is a model we built for the world 
a model we built for bali 
you just have to follow these simple simple rules be local like the environment lead and think about how your grandchildren might build 
so mr gore thank you 
ruined my life but you gave me an incredible future 
if you're interested in being involved in finishing green school and building the next fifty around the world please come and see us 
thank you 

when i graduated i moved to northern california and i lived in a little town called elk on the mendocino coast and i didn't have a phone or tv but i had u s mail and life was good back then if you could remember it 
go to the general store for a cup of coffee and a brownie ship my film to san francisco and lo and behold two days later it would end up on my front door which was way better than having to fight the traffic of hollywood i didn't have much money but i had time in a sense of wonder 
started shooting time lapse photography 
it would take me a month to shoot a four minute roll film because that's all i could afford 
shooting time lapse flowers continuously nonstop twenty four hours a day seven days a week for over thirty years at the theater move a dance i'll never get tired

if you compare light energy to musical scales it would only be one octave that the naked eye could see which is right in the middle 
enormously grateful for our brains that can now take the electrical impulse that comes from light energy to create images in order for us to explore our world 
we are grateful the way of hearts that can feel the vibrations in order for us to allow ourselves to feel the pleasure and the beauty of nature 
it is a gift to cultivate appreciation and gratitude the gift i want to share with you today a project i'm working on called happiness revealed that will give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of therefore

not just another day 
to one day that is given to you today given to you the trickiest it's the only gift that you're right now and you only appropriate response is grateful 
we should do nothing else but to cultivate that response to the great gift this unique day is here she learned to the school and as if it were the first to life and in the very last day you will spend the day

thank you very much 
like to tell you about two games of chess 
it first happened in one thousand nine ninety seven which gary kasparov a human lost the deep blue a machine 
for many this was the dawn of a new era one were man would be dominated by machine 
but here we are twenty years on and the greatest change in how we relate to computers is the ipad not how 
the second game was a freestyle chess tournament in two thousand and five in which man and machine could enter together as partners rather than adversaries if they chose 
at first the results were predictable 
even a supercomputer was beaten by a grandmaster with a relatively weak laptop 
surprise came at the end who won not a grandmaster with a supercomputer but actually to american amateurs using three relatively weak laptops 
ability to coach and manipulate their computers to deeply explore specific positions effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of the grandmasters and the superior computational power of other adversaries 
is an astonishing result average men average machines beating the best man the best machine 
anyway then it's supposed to be man versus machine 
instead it's about cooperation and the right type of cooperation 
we've been paying a lot of attention to marvin minsky s vision for artificial intelligence over the last fifty years 
the sexy vision for sure many have embraced it has become the dominant school of thought and computer science 
but as we enter the era of big data of network systems of open platforms and embedded technology i'd like to suggest it's time to reevaluate an alternative vision that was actually developed around the same time 
i'm talking about j c r licklider human computer symbiosis perhaps better termed intelligence augmentation 
quick glider was a computer science titan who had a profound effect on the development of technology and the internet 
his vision was to enable man and machine to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without the inflexible dependence on predetermined programs 
note that word cooperate licklider encourages us not to take a toaster and make it data from star trek but to take a human and make her more capable 
humans are so amazing how we think are non linear approaches are creativity iterative hypotheses all very difficult as possible for computers to do 
letter intuitively realized this contemplating humans setting the goals formulating the hypotheses determining the criteria and performing the evaluation 
of course in other ways humans are so limited 
with terrible at scale computation and volume 
we require high end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing 
licklider foresaw computers doing all the route nyse of a work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making 
silently without much fanfare this approach has been compiling victories beyond chess 
protein folding a topic that shares the incredible expansiveness of chess there are more ways of folding a protein than there are atoms in the universe this is a world changing problem with huge implications for our ability to understand and treat disease 
for this task supercomputer field brute force simply isn't enough 
bullet a game created by computer scientists illustrates the value of the approach 
non technical non biologist amateurs play a video game in which they visually arrange the structure of the protein allowing the computer to manage the atomic forces and interactions and identify structural issues 
this approach beat supercomputers fifty percent of the time and tide thirty percent of the time 
foldit recently made a notable and major scientific discovery by deciphering the structure the mason pfizer monkey virus 
protease that had eluded determination for over ten years was solved by three players in a matter of days perhaps the first major scientific advance to come from playing a video game 
last year on the side of the twin towers and nine eleven memorial opened 
it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called meaningful adjacency places the names the next to each other based on their relationships to one another friends families coworkers 
when you put it all together it's quite a computational challenge thirty five hundred victims eighty one hundred adjacency requests the importance of the overall physical specifications and 
final aesthetics when first reported by the media full credit for such a feat was given to an algorithm from the new york city design firm 
but the truth is a bit more nuanced 
while an algorithm was used to develop the underlying framework humans use that framework to design the final result 
so in this case a computer evaluated millions of possible layouts managed to complex relational system and kept track of a very large set of measurements and variables allowing the humans to focus on design and compositional choices 
so the more you look around you the more you see licklider vision everywhere 
whether it's augmented reality and your iphone or gps in your car human computer symbiosis is making us more capable 
so if you want to improve human computer symbiosis what can you do 
and you can start by designing the human into the process 
instead of thinking about what a computer will do to solve the problem design the solution around with the human will do as well 
when you do this you'll quickly realized that you spend all of your time on the interface between man and machine specifically on designing away the friction and the interaction 
in fact this friction is more important than the power of the man or the power of the machine in determining overall capability 
so that's why to amateurs with few laptops handily be a supercomputer and a grandmaster 
what kasparov calls process as a byproduct of friction 
the better the process the less the friction 
minimizing friction turns out to be the decisive variable 
take another example big data 
every interaction we have in the world is recorded by an ever growing array of sensors your phone credit card computer 
the result is big data and actually presents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition 
a major emphasis of most approaches to begin to focus on how do i store this data how do i searched the state 
processes data these are necessary but insufficient questions 
imperative is not to figure out how to compute but what to compute 
so how do you impose human intuition on data at this scale 
again we start by designing the human into the process 
when payout was first starting as a business their biggest challenge was not how do i send money back and forth online it was how do i do that without being defrauded by organized crime why so challenging 
because while computers can learn to detect and identify fraud based on patterns they can't learn to do that based on patterns they've never seen before and organized crime has a lot in common with this audience brilliant people relentlessly resourceful entrepreneurial spirit and one huge and important difference purpose 
while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters catching the cleverest the difference between success and failure 
a whole class of problems like this one's with adaptive adversaries they rarely if ever present with a repeatable pattern this discernible the computers 
instead there's some inherent component of innovation or disruption and increasingly these problems are buried and big data 
for example terrorism terrorists are always adapting and minor and major ways to new circumstances and despite what you might see on tv these adaptations and the detection of them are fundamentally human 
computers don't detect novel patterns and new behaviors are humans do humans using technology testing hypotheses searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them 
sama bin laden was not caught by artificial intelligence 
he was caught by dedicated resourceful brilliant people in partnership with various technologies 
as appealing as it might sound you cannot algorithmically data mind your way to the answer 
there is no fine terrorists button and the more data we integrate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data formats from very disparate systems to less effective data mining can be 
instead people will have to look at data and search for insight and as licklider foresaw long ago the key to great results here is the right type of cooperation and as kasparov realized that means minimizing friction at the interface 
this approach makes possible things like combing through all available data from very different sources identifying key relationships and putting it in one place something that's been nearly impossible to do before 
for some this as terrifying privacy and civil liberties implications 
to others it foretells of an era of greater privacy and civil liberties protections but privacy and civil liberties are of fundamental importance 
it must be acknowledged and they can't be swept aside even with the best of intentions 
so let's explore through a couple of examples the impact that technologies built to drive human computer symbiosis have had in recent times 
in october two thousand and seven us and coalition forces raided et al qaeda safe house in the city of singe are on the syrian bordeaux of iraq 
they found a treasure trove of documents seven hundred biographical sketches of foreign fighters these foreign fighters had left their families and the golf the levant in north africa to join al qaeda in iraq 
these records were human resource once the foreign fighters filled the amount as they joined the organization 
it turns out that al qaeda to is not without its bureaucracy they answered questions like who recruited you what's your hometown what occupation do you seek 
and that last question a surprising insight was revealed 
the vast majority of foreign fighters are seeking to become suicide bombers for martyrdom hugely important since between two thousand and three and two thousand and seven iraq had three thousand eight hundred and eighty two suicide bombings a major source of 
instability analyzing this data 
the originals were sheets of paper in arabic that had to be scanned and translated 
the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational timeframe using humans pdfs and tenacity alone 
the researchers had to lever up their human minds with technology to dive deeper to explore non obvious hypotheses and in fact insights emerged 
twenty percent of the foreign fighters were from libya fifty percent of those from a single town in libya hugely important since prior statistics but that figure at three percent 
it also helped to hone in on a figure of rising importance and al qaeda abu yahya al libi a senior cleric and the libyan islamic fighting group 
in march two thousand and seven he gave a speech after wish there was a surge in participation amongst libyan foreign fighters 
perhaps most clever of all though and least obvious by flipping the data on its head the researchers were able to deeply explore the coordination networks in syria there were ultimately responsible for receiving and transporting the foreign fighters to the border 
so these networks of mercenaries not ideologues who were in the coordination business for profit 
for example they charge saudi foreign fighters substantially more than libyans money that would have otherwise gone to al qaeda 
perhaps the adversary would disrupt their own network if they knew they were cheating would be

the only institution with detailed knowledge of haiti's floodplains had been leveled and the earthquake leadership inside 
so the question is which camps are at risk how many people in these camps what's the timeline for flooding and given very limited resources infrastructure how do we prioritize the relocation

thank you 
i spent the last two years trying to resolve to ending why is productivity so disappointing in all the companies were aware 
for i have worked with more than five hundred companies 
but despite all the technological advances computers i t communications telecommunications the internet 
he managed to why is there so little engagement at work 
why do people feel so miserable even actively engaged disengaging their colleagues acting against the interests of their company 
but despite all the affiliation events the celebration the people in she achieves the leadership development programs to train managers on how to beat yamauchi they their teams 
but at the beginning i thought there was a chicken and egg issue because people are less engaged they are less productive 
or vice versa because they are less productive we put more pressure and they are less engaged 
but as we are doing our analysis we realized that there was a common with close to these two issues that relate in fact to the basic pillars of management 
the way we organize is based on two 
hard structure process systems the soft shillings sentiments interpersonal relationships traits personnel 
whenever we company reorganize restructure reengineer go through a cultural transformation program it uses these two pillars 
and now we try to refine them we try to combine them 
real issue is and this is the answer to the two enigmatic these pillars are obsolete 
you read in business books is based a though one of your they're all their combination they are obsolete what does it work how do they work when you try to use these were portuguese in front of the complexity of business 
how to approach basically that you start from strategy requirements structure process system keeps the ice cookout committees headquarters hubs clusters you name it 
i forgot all the matrix incentive communities middle officials and interfaces 
what happens basically on the left you have more complexity the new complexity of business 
we need quality cursed reliability speed 
there is a new requirement we use the same approach 
we create dedicated picture process systems basically to deal with the new complexity of business 
hub approach create just complicated ness in the organization 
so let's take an example an automotive company the engineering division is a five dimensional matrix 
if you open any cell of the matrix to fight another twenty three dimensional matrix 
we have mr noise mischief petrol consumption mr archie cochrane properties 
for any new requirement you have a dedicated function in charge of lining engineers against the new requirement 
what happens when the new requirement 
some years ago the new requirement appeared on the marketplace the length of the women she period 
so they are for the new requirement is repair ability making gas easy to repair 
otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the like if you had to remove the engine to access delights the car will have to stay one week in the garage instead of two hours and were raunchy budget will explode 
so what was the solution using the how to approach 
she 's a new requirement the solution is to create a new function mystery probability 
mystery perishability critical capability process 
with the reaper habitually scorecard with ripa ability matrix and eventually you capability infantile 
came on top of twenty five or they occupy 
what percentage of these people is variable compensation 
when she presented most divided by twenty six keep your eyes probability makes a difference of zero point eight percent 
what the candidates making their actions their choices to simplify zero but where to curse for zero impact 
a mystery but i d g process cookout evaluation coordination with a twenty five other coordinators to have zero impact 
now in front of the new complexity of business the only solution is not drawing boxes with reporting lines 
it 's basically the interplay 
how the paths work together 
connections the interactions the snap 
it 's not the skeleton of books sees it is the nervous system of adaptive ness and intelligence you know you could call it cooperation basically whenever people cooperate they use less resources in everything you do capability issue is a corporation problem 
when you design cars please take into account the needs of those who will repair the cars in the aft yourselves garages 
when we don't cooperate we need more time more equipment ma systems more teams 
we need when procurement supply chain manufacturing don't cooperate with mustard more inventories more working capital 
who will pay for that shareholders customers know that we refuse 
so who is left 
the employee who has to compensate through their super individual efforts for the lack of cooperation stress burnout they are overwhelmed accident 
no wonder they disengage 
how do the hard and soft try to foster cooperation 
hub in banks when there is a problem with tobacco she's on the front office they don't cooperate what's the solution 
they create a middle office 
what happens when your later 
instead of one problem between the back into the front now have two problems 
between the back end between the middle and the front 
plus i have to pay for the middle office 
how the approach is unable to foster cooperation 
it can only add new book sees new bones in the skeleton 
soft approach to make people cooperate we need to make them like each other 
improving their personal feelings the more people like each other the more they will cooperate 
which is totally wrong if you live and counter productive look at home i have to tvs why precisely not to have to cooperate with my way not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife 
why i don't worry i try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife precisely because i love my wife 
if i didn't love my wife one gb will be enough you will watch my favorite football game you feel happy carries the book all the door the more we like each other the more we avoid the real cooperation that would train our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs 
we go for a second tv or will escalate the decision above for arbitration 
definitely these approaches are obsolete 
to deal with complexity to enhance the nervous system we have created what we call the smashed simplicity approach based on simple rules 
simple rule number one understand what others do 
what is the real work 
we need to go beyond the book sees the job descriptions beyond the face of the container to understand the real content 
me designer is happy to why you're here i know that it will mean that you will have to remove the engine to access the lights 
second you need to reinforce integrator 
integrators are not middle or she sees the managers existing managers that reinforces the half power an interest to make all their cooperate 
how can you reinforce your managers as integrators by removing layers when they are too many layers people are too far from the extra and therefore they keep your eyes matrix they need poor proxies for reality 
we don't understand reality and they add the complicated ness of matrix kph 
by removing roofs the bigger we are the more we did integrators therefore less rules we must have to give discretionary power to manage 
we do the opposite the bigger and we are the more rules we create 
we end up with the encyclopaedia britannica roofs 
we need to increase the quantity of power so that you can empower everybody to use the judgment their intelligence 
we must get more cows to people that they have the critical mass of cows to take the risk to cooperate to move out of installation 
otherwise they will withdraw they will disengage these words they come from game theory and organizational sociology 
can increase the shadow of the future 
create feedback loops that expose people to the consequences of their actions 
which is where the automotive company did when they so that mystery behind the jihad no impact 
they say to the design engineers now in three years when the new car is launched on the market you will move to the actual since network and become in charge of the raunchy budget and neither around the raunchy budget explode it will explode in your head much more powerful than zero point eight percent variable compensation 
we need also to increase reciprocity by removing the buffers that make us self sufficient 
when you remove these bushels you hold me by the nose i hold you by the year we will cooperate remove the second cd 
there are many seconds she does that work they don't create value that just provide dysfunctional self sufficiency 
you need to reward those who cooperate and blame those who don't cooperate 
ceo of the lego group you're gonna stop has a great way to use it 
he says blame is not for failure it is for failing to help or ask for help you changes everything so then it becomes in my interest to be transparent on my real weaknesses my real forecast because i knew i will not let me if i fail but if i fail to help or ask for help 
when you do this it has a lot of implications on organizational design 
we stopped doing boxes dotted line through line you can do incomplete 
it has a lot of implications on financial policies that we use 
human resource management practices 
when you do that you can manage complexity the new complexity of business without getting 
create more value with lower cost 
simultaneously improved performance and satisfaction at work because you have removed the common would cause that hinders both complicated ness this is your battle business leaders 
real battle is not against competitors 
is rubbish very abstract 
when we meet competitors to fight them 
the real battle against ourselves against our bureaucracy our complicated 
if only you can fight can do 
thank you 
we face issues like climate change or the safety of vaccines where we have to answer questions whose answers rely heavily on scientific information 
scientists tell us that the world is warming 
scientists tell us that vaccines are safe 
but how do we know if they're right 
why should we believe the science 
the fact is many of us actually don't believe the science 
public opinion polls consistently show that significant proportion to the american people don't believe the climate is warming due to human activities don't think that there's evolution by natural selection and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines 
so why should we believe the science 
scientists don't like talking about science as a matter of belief 
in fact they would contract science with faith and they would say belief in the domain of faith 
fade as a separate thing apart and distinct from science 
indeed they would say religion is based on faith or maybe the calculus of pascal's wager 
blaise pascal with the seventeenth century mathematician who tried to bring scientific reasoning to the question of whether or not he should believe in god and his wager went like this well if god doesn't exist but i decided to believe in him nothing much is really lost 
maybe a few hours on sunday but god exists and i don't believe in him then i'm in deep trouble 
so pascal said we'd better believe in god 
whereas one of my college professor said he clutched but the handrail faith he made that leap of faith leaving science and rationalism behind 
and now the fact is though for most of us most scientific claims are leap of faith 
we can't really judge scientific claims for ourselves in most cases 
indeed this is actually true for most scientists as well outside of their own specialties 
so if you think about it and geologists can't tell you whether the vaccine is safe 
both chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory 
physicists cannot tell you despite the claims of some of them whether or not tobacco causes cancer 
so if he didn't scientists themselves have to make a leap of faith outside their own field then why do they accept the claims of other scientists 
why did they believe each other's claims 
should we believe those claims 
so what i'd like to argue that yes we should but not for the reason that most of us think 
most of us were taught in school the reason we should believe in science is because of the scientific method 
we were taught that scientists follow a method and that this method guarantees the truth of their claims 
the method that most of us were taught in school we can call it the textbook method is the hypothetical inductive method 
according to the standard model the textbook model scientists develop hypotheses they deduced the consequences alone hypotheses and then they go out into the world and they say okay well are those consequences true can we observe them taking place in the natural world and if they are true then the scientists say great we know the hypothesis is correct 
so there are many famous examples in the history of science as scientists doing exactly this 
one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein 
when einstein developed the theory of general relativity one of the consequences of his theory was that space time wasn't just an empty void but that it actually had a fabric 
that fabric was bent in the presence of massive objects like the sun 
so if this theory were true then it meant that light as it passed the sun should actually be bent around it 
that was a pretty startling prediction and it took a few years before scientists were able to tested but they did tested in one thousand nine hundred and keen and lo and behold it turn out to be true 
it actually does band as it travels around the sun 
was a huge confirmation of the theory 
which consume proof of the truth of this radical new idea and it was written up in many newspapers around the globe 
sometimes this theory or this model is referred to as the inductive normal logical model mainly because of academics like to make things complicated 
but also because in the ideal case it's about laws 
so no more logical means having to do with laws 
in the case the hypothesis isn't just an idea ideally it's a law of nature 
why does it matter that it's the law of nature 
because if it's a lot it can't be broken 
with the law then it will always be true in all times in all places no matter what the circumstances are 
all of you know at least one example of a famous law einstein's famous equation e equal mc squared which tells us what the relationship is between energy and matter 
that relationship is true no matter what 
and now it turns out that there are several pounds with this model 
the main problem is wrong joe and i'm going to talk about three reasons why it's wrong 
for the first reason is a logical reason 
the problem of the fallacy of affirming the consequence 
so that's another fancy academic way of saying that false theories can make true predictions 
so just because the predictions come true doesn't actually logically prove that the theory is correct 
i have a good example of that to again from the history of science 
is a picture of the ptolemaic universe when the earth at the center of the universe and the sun and the planets going around it 
the ptolemaic model was believed by many very smart people for many centuries will fly with the answer is because it made lots of predictions came true 
the ptolemaic system enabled astronomers to make accurate predictions of the motions of the planet in fact more accurate predictions at first then the copernican theory which we now with thing is true 
so that's one problem with the textbook model 
second problem is a practical problem and it's the problem of auxiliary hyde park 
auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions that scientists are making that they may or may not even be aware that there are making 
so an important example of this comes from the copernican model which ultimately replace the ptolemaic system 
so when i copernicus said actually the earth is not the center of the universe the fun is the center of the solar system the earth moves around the sun scientists said well ok nikolai if that's true we ought to be able to detect the motion of the earth around the sun 
so this slide here illustrates a concept known as stellar parallel 
astronomers said if the earth is moving and we look at a prominent starlets a serious line on manhattan's you can see the stars but imagine around the country imagine you chose that raw life and we look at a star in december we see that star against a backdrop of distant stars 
we now make the same observation six months later when the moon when the earth has moved to this position in june we looked at that same style we see it against the different backdrop 
that difference that angular difference is the stellar parents 
so this is a prediction that the copernican model maker 
astronomers looked for the stellar parallax and they found nothing nothing at all 
many people argue that this proved that the copernican mouse false 
so what happened well in hindsight we can say that astronomers were making chuan jewelry hypotheses both of which we were now say were incorrect 
the first was an assumption about the size of the earth's orbit 
astronomers were assuming that the earth's orbit was large relative to the distance the stars 
today we withdraw the picture more like this if comes from nasa and you see the earth's orbit is actually quite small 
in fact it's actually much smaller and even then shown here 
stellar parallax therefore is very small and actually very hard to detect 
that leads to the second reason why the predictions and work because scientists were also assuming that the telescope's they had were sensitive enough to detect the parallel 
and that turned out not to be true 
it wasn't until the one thousand nine hundred and century that scientists were able to detect the seller parallax 
so there's a third problem as well 
the third problem is simply a factual palm that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model 
a lot of science isn't inductive at all it actually inductive 
by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily started with theories and hypotheses often they just start with observations of stuff going on in the world 
the most famous example of that is one of the most famous scientists who ever lived charles darwin 
when darwin went out as a young man on the voyage of the beagle he didn't have a hypothesis he didn't have a theory 
he just knew that he wanted to have a career as a scientist and he started to collect data 
when he knew that he hated medicine because the silent blood made them sick so he had to have an alternative career path 
he started collecting data 
he collected many things including his famous finches 
when he collected these finches he threw them in a bag and he had no idea what they meant 
for many years later back in london darwin looked at his data again and began to develop an explanation and that explanation was the theory of natural selection 
besides inductive science scientists also often participate in modeling 
one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things and how did we do that well one way you can do is to build a model that tests and idea 
so this is a picture of henry canal who is a scottish geologists in the nineteenth century you can county scottish because he's wearing a deerstalker cap and wellington boots and control wanted to answer the question how mountains formed and one of the things he had observed is that if you look at mountains like the appalachians you often find that the rocks in them are folded and unfolded in a particular way which suggested to him that they were actually being compressed from the side 
this idea with later play a major role in discussions of continental drift 
so he built this model this crazy contraption would leavers and wood and here's a wheelbarrow buckets of being sledgehammer 
i don't know why he's got the wellington boots maybe it's going to rain and he created the physical model in order to demonstrate that you couldn't create you could in fact create patterns and rocks or at least in this case in mud that looked a lot like mountains if you compress them from five 
so it was an argument about the cause of mountains 
nowadays most scientists prefer to work inside so they don't build physical models so much as to make computer simulations 
computer simulations that kind of a model 
a model that made with mathematics and light the physical models of the nineteenth century it's very important for thinking about causes 
so one of the big questions do with climate change we have tremendous amount of evidence that the earth is warming warming up 
this slide here the black line shows the measurements that scientists have taken for the last one hundred and fifty years showing that the earth's temperature has steadily increased and you can see in particular that in the last fifty years there's been this dramatic increase of nearly one degree centigrade or almost two degrees fahrenheit 
so what though is driving that change 
how can we know what's causing the observed warming 
scientists can model it using a computer simulation 
so this diagram illustrates a computer simulation that has looked at all the different factors that we know can influence the earth's climate so sulphate particles from air pollution volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions changes in solar radiation and of course greenhouse gases 
they asked the question what set of variables put into a model will reproduce what we actually see in real life 
so here's the real life and black 
here's the model in this light gray and the answer is a model that includes it's the answer he on that fhp all of the above 
the only way you can reproduce the observed temperature measurement is with all of these things put together including greenhouse gases and in particular you can see that the increasing greenhouse gases tax this very dramatic increase in temperature over the last fifty years 
so this is why climate scientists say it's not just that we know that climate change is happening we know that greenhouse gases are a major part of the reason fly 
so now because there are all these different things and scientists do the philosopher paul feyerabend famously said the only principle in science that doesn't inhibit progress is anything goes now this quotation has often been taken out of context because fire up and was not actually saying that in science anything goes 
what he was saying was actually the full quotation is if you pressed me to say what is the method of science i would have to say anything goes what he was trying to say is that scientists do a lot of different things scientists are creative 
but then this pushes the question back if scientists don't use a single method and how do they decide what's right and what's wrong and who judges and the answer is scientists judge and they judged by judging evidence 
scientists collect evidence in many different ways but however they collected they have to subjected to scrutiny 
this led the sociologist robert merton to focus on the question of how scientists scrutinized data and evidence and he said they do it in a way he called organized skepticism and by that he meant to organize because they do it collectively they do it as a group and skepticism because they do it from a position of distrust 
sorry to say the burden of proof is on the person with the novel claim 
in this and science is intrinsically conservative 
it's quite hard to persuade the scientific community to say yes we know something this is true so despite the popularity of the concept of paradigm shifts what we find that actually really major changes in scientific thinking on relatively rare in the history of science 
so finally that brings us to one more idea if scientists judge evidence collectively this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus and to say that at the end of the day what science is what scientific knowledge is is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny collective scrutiny have judged the evidence and concluded come to a conclusion about it either yea or nay 
so we can think of scientific knowledge as a consensus of experts 
we can also think of scientists being a kind of a jury except it's a very special kind of jury 
not a jury of your peers it's a jury of geeks 
a jury of men and women with ph d and unlike a conventional jury which had only two choices guilty not guilty the scientific actually has a number of choices 
scientists can say yes something true 
scientists can say no it's false 
they can say well it might be true but we need to work more and collect more evident 
they can say it might be true but we don't know how to answer the question and we're going to put it aside and maybe we'll come back to it later 
what scientists call intractable 
this leads us to one final problem if scientists would scientists say it is and isn't digestion appeal to authority 
weren't we all taught in school of the appeal to authority and a logical fallacy 
well the paradox of modern science the paradox of the conclusion i think historians and philosophers and sociologists have come to that actually scientists is the appeal to authority back if not the authority of the individual no matter how smart that individual is like play doh or socrates or einstein 
the authority of the collective community 
can think of it as a kind of wisdom of the crowd but a very special kind of crowd 
science doesn't appeal to authority but it's not based on any individual no matter how smart that individual may be 
based on the collective wisdom the collective knowledge the collective work of all of the scientists who have worked on a particular problem 
scientists have a kind of cultural collective dish chest this show me culture illustrated by this nice woman here showing her colleagues her evidence 
because these people don't really look like scientists because they are much too happy 
so i've brings me to my final point 
of us get up in the morning 
both of us trust our cars 
well i think i'm in manhattan this is a bad analogy but if you didn't most americans who don't live in manhattan get up in the morning and getting their cars and turn on the ignition and their cars work and they work incredibly well 
the modern automobile hardly ever breaks down 
so why is that why did cars works so well 
not because of the genius of henry ford or karl benz or even ilan mask 
because the modern automobile is the product of more than one hundred years of work by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people 
for modern automobile is the product of the collected work and wisdom and experience of every man and woman who has ever worked on a car and the reliability of the technology is the result of that accumulated effort 
with benefit not just from the genius of bench and forward and mask but from the collective intelligence and hard work of all of the people who have worked on the modern car 
the same is true of science only sciences even older 
basis for justin science is actually the frame as our bases interest in technology and the same as the hour basis for trust in anything namely experience 
but it shouldn't be blind trust any more than we would have lie interest in anything 
our trust in science like science itself should be based on evidence and that means that scientists have to become better communicators 
we have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it and it means that we have to become better listeners 
thank you very much 

so recently some white guys and from black women swap twitter avatars or pictures online 
but he didn't change their content that kept tweeting the same as usual but suddenly the white guys notice they were getting called the n word all the time and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse whereas the black women and all of a sudden notice things got a lot more pleasant for them 
here might find your old your internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally ferries writing puppies that's a thing google it but the rest of us know that the internet can be a really ugly place 
i 'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that i think are healthy for our democracy 
when talking about nasty personal attacks 
maybe it's happened to you but it's at least twice as likely to happen and be worse if you're a woman a person of color are gay or more than one of the same time 
in fact just as i was writing this talk i found a twitter account called sally cone sucks the bio says that i'm a man hater in a bowl dyke and the only thing i've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality which incidentally is only a third correct 
law 
seriously we all say we hate this crap 
the question is whether you're willing to make a personal sacrifice to change it 
and i don't mean giving up the internet 
i mean changing the way you click because clicking is a public asked 
no longer the case that a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers 
increasingly we're all the media 
i used to think oh ok i get dressed up i put on a lot of makeup and go on television i talk about the news 
that is a public act of making media 
and then i go home and i browse the web and i'm reading twitter and a private actor consuming media 
of course it is i'm in my pajamas wrong everything we blog everything we tweet and everything we click is a public act of making media 
we are the new editors 
we decide what gets attention based on what we give our attention to 
how the media works now 
all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see more of based on what you click on and that in turn shapes our whole culture 
over three out of five americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now but i'm going to guess that at least three out of five americans are clicking on the same insult oriented rumour mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society 
in an increasingly noisy media landscape the incentive is to make more noise to be heard and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty 
it does not have to be that way it does not we can change the incentives 
for starters there are two things we can all do 
first don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt 
if someone is being abused online do something be a hero this is your chance to speak up speak out be a good person drown out the negative with the positive 
second we got us there are clicking on the lowest common denominator bottom feeding link bait 
you don't like the twenty four seven all kardashians all the time programming you gotta stop clicking on the stories about kim kardashian side boob 
i know you doing youtube apparently 
i mean really same example if you don't like politicians calling each other names start clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the other guy in the other party 
clicking on a train wreck just poured gasoline on it 
it makes it worse the fire spreads 
our whole culture gets burned 
what gets the most clicks wins then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks because clicking is a public act so click responsibly thank you 

but i'd like to tell you a story about death and architecture 
one hundred years ago we tend to die of infectious diseases like pneumonia that if they took hold would take us away quite quickly 
we tend to die at home in our own beds looked after by family that was the default option because a lot of people lacked access to medical care 
then in the twentieth century a lot of things changed 
we develop new medicines like penicillin so we could treat those infectious diseases 
new medical technologies like x ray machines to have invented and because they were so big and expensive we needed large centralized buildings to keep them in and they became our modern hospitals 
after the second world war a lot of countries setup universal health care system so that everyone who needed treatment could get 
the result was that lifespans extended from about forty five at the start of the country to almost double that today 
in the twentieth century it was this time a huge optimism about what science could offer but with all of the focus on life was forgotten even as our coach to change dramatically 
i'm an architect and for the past year and a half i've been looking at these changes and what they mean for architecture related to death and dying 
we now can die of cancer and heart disease and what that means is that many of us have a long period of chronic illness at the end of our lives 
during that period will likely spend a lot of time and hospitals and hospices and care homes 
we 've all been in a modern hospital 
those fluorescent light and the endless corridors and those rows of uncomfortable chairs 
hospital architecture has in its bad reputation 
but the surprising thing is it wasn't always like this 
hospital italian or chan keep built and fourteen one thousand nine by granola ski who was one of the most famous and influential architect to this time 
when i look at this building and then think about hospitals today what amazes me is that buildings ambition 
it 's just a really great building 
happy courtyards in the middle so that all of the rooms have daylight and fresh air and the rooms are big and they have high ceilings so they just feel more comfortable to be 
but it's also beautiful 
somehow forgotten that that's even possible for the hospital 
if we want better buildings for dying then we have to talk about it but because we find the subject of death uncomfortable we don't talk about it and we don't question how we as a society approached 
one of the things that surprised me most in my research though is how changeable attitudes actually are 
the first crematorium in the uk which was built in working under eighteen seventies 
when i was first built our protests and the local village 
commission wasn't socially acceptable and ninety nine point eight percent of people got buried 
and yet only one hundred years later three quarters of brisket committed 
people are actually really open to changing things if given the chance to talk about them 
this conversation about death and architecture was what i wanted to start when i did my first exhibition on it in venice in june which was called death in venice and it was designed to be quite playful so that people would literally engage with it 
is one of our exhibit switches an interactive map of london that shows just how much of the real estate and the city is given over to death and dying and as you wave your hand across the mock the name of that piece of real estate the building or cemetery is revealed 
i like the bits with a theme is a postcard that people could take away with them 
they showed people's homes and hospitals and cemeteries and mortuary and they tell the story of the different spaces that we pass through on either side of death 
we wanted to show that where we die is a key part of how we die 
the strangest thing was the way that visitors reacted to the exhibition especially the audio visual works 
we had people dancing on running and jumping as the tried to activate the exhibit different winds and at a certain point they would kind of stock and remember that there were in an exhibition about death and maybe that's not how you're supposed to act 
but actually i would question whether there is one way they're supposed to act around and if does not i'd ask you to think about what you think a good death is and what you think that architecture that supports a good death might be like and might be a little less like this and a little more like this 
thank you 

when your child anything and everything is possible 
the challenge so often is hanging on to that as we grow up 
and there's a four year old i had the opportunity to sail for the first time 
i will never forget the excitement as we close the coast 
i will never forget the feeling of adventure as i climbed on board the boat and said in her tiny cabin for the first time 
but the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom the feeling that i felt when we hoisted her sales 
as a four year old child it was the greatest sense of freedom that i could ever imagine 
i made my mind up there and then that one day somehow i was going to sail around the world 
so i did what i could in my life to get closer to that dream 
ten it was saving my school denouement a change 
every single day for eight years i had mashed potato and baked beans which costs for each and gravy was free 
every day i would pile up the change on the top of my money box and when that pile reached a pound i would drop it in and cross off one of one hundred squares are drawn on a piece of paper 
finally i bought a tiny dengue 
i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal 
i read every book i could on failing and then eventually having been told by my school i wasn't clever enough to be a bit left school aged seventeen to begin my apprenticeship and failing 
so imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who i knew could make that dream come true 
i fell on my life depended on that moment an incredibly he said yes 
i could barely contain my excitement as i sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which i was going to sail solo nonstop around the world 
from that first making to the finish line of the race it was everything i'd ever imagined 
just like in my dreams they were amazing parts and tough parts 
we missed an iceberg by twenty feet 
nine times i climbed to the top of a ninety foot mass 
we were blown on our side and the southern ocean 
but the thump that the wildlife and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking 
after three months at sea aged just twenty four i finished in second position 
i loved it so much so that within six months i decided to go around the world again but this time not into race to try to be the fastest person ever to sell solo nonstop round the world 
and for this i needed a different craft bigger wider faster more powerful 
and just to give that boat from scale i could climb inside her mashed all the way to the top 
seventy five foot long sixty foot wide i affectionately called her moby she was multihull 
when we built her no one had ever made it solo nonstop round the world in one though many have tried that whilst we built a frenchman took about twenty five percent bigger than her and not only did he make it but he took the record from ninety three days right down to seven 
the ball was now much much higher 
from these boats wrecks liking to sail 
it was a training sale of the french coast this i know well because i was one of the five crew members on board 
five seconds is all it took from everything being fined to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater and that five seconds goes quickly 
see how far below those guys to fears 
imagine that alone in the southern ocean plunged into icy water thousands of miles away from land 
it was christmas day i was forging in southern ocean underneath australia 
the conditions were horrendous 
it was approaching a part in the ocean which was two thousand miles away from the nearest 
a town the nearest land was antarctica and the nearest people would be those manning the european space station above me you really are in the middle 
if you need help and you're still alive it takes four days for ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port 
helicopter can reach you out there and no planes can land 
we are forging ahead of a huge storm 
within it there was eighty knots of wind which was far too much wind for the boat and to cope with 
ways we're already forty to fifty feet high and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard 
if we didn't fail fast enough we'd be engulfed by that storm and either capsized or smashed to pieces 
will quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge 
speed i so desperately needed brought with it danger 
we all know what it's like driving a car twenty miles an hour thirty forty it's not too stressful we can concentrate we can turn on the radio 
take that to fifty sixty seventy accelerate through to eight hundred and ninety one hundred miles an hour 
now you have white knuckles and you gripping the steering wheel 
take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers the windscreen the headlights and the brakes 
but that's what it's like in the southern ocean you can imagine it will be quite difficult to sleep in that situation even at the passenger 
but you're not a passenger 
we are alone on a boat you can barely stand up and and you have to make every single decision on board 
i was absolutely exhausted physically and mentally 
fell changes in twelve hours 
the main shall wait three times my body weight and after each change i would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with a freezing southern ocean air burning the back of my throat 
but out there those lowest of lows are so often contrasted with the highest of highs 
a few days later we came out of the back of the low 
against all odds we've been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression 
sky cleared the rain stopped and in a heartbeat the monster seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains 
it's hard to explain but you enter a different mode when you head out there 
voters your entire world and what you take with you when you leave is all you have 
if i said you will now go off into vancouver and find everything that you will need for your survival for the next three months that's quite a task 
about food fuel clothes even toilet roll and toothpaste 
and that's what we do and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food 
no experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word finite what we have out there is all we have 
there is no more 
never in life would i ever translated that definition of finite that i felt on board to anything outside of sailing until i stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record suddenly i connected the dots 
global economy is no different 
entirely dependent on find out materials we only have once in the history of humanity 
and it was a bit like saying something you weren't expecting under a stone and having two choices either put that stone to one side and learn more about it or i put that stone back and i carried on with my dream job of sailing around the world 
i chose the first i put it to one side and i began anew journey of learning speaking chief executives expert scientists economists to try and understand just how our global economy works 
when my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places 
this photo was taken in the burning of coal fired power station 
it was fascinated by coal fundamental to our global energy needs but also very close to my family 
and my great grandfather was a coal miner and he spent fifty years of his life underground 
is a photo of him and when you see that photo you see someone from another era 
no one wears the trousers with the waistband quite that high in this day and age but yet that's me with my great grandfather and by the way they are not he's really is 
we were close i remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining story 
he talked to the camaraderie on the ground and the fact that the mind is used to save the cross of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they've worked with underground 
it was like it was yesterday 
my journey of learning i went to the world coal association website and there in the middle of the home pages said we have about one hundred and eighteen years of coal left and i thought to myself well as well outside my lifetime and a much greater figure that the predictions for oil 
but i did the math and i realized that my great grandfather had been born exactly one hundred and eighteen years before that year and i sat on his nathan i was eleven years old and i realize it's nothing in time in history 
it made me make the decision i never thought i would make to leave the sport of solar sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge i'd ever come across the future of our global economy 
i quickly realized it wasn't just about energy 
it was also materials 
in two thousand and eight i picked up a scientific study looking at how many years we have a valuable materials we extract from the ground copper sixty one tenzing forty filled with when 
these figures couldn't be exact but we knew those materials were finite 
we only have them once 
and yet our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly exponentially 
with more people in the world with more stuff with effectively seen one hundred years of price declines in those basic commodities are raised in just ten years 
this affects all of us 
brought huge volatility and prices so much so that in two thousand and eleven your average european car manufacturer so a raw material price increase a five hundred million euros wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over 
the more i learned the more i started to change my own life 
and i started traveling last doing less using left 
it felt like actually doing less was what we have to do 
he sat uneasily with me 
it didn't feel right 
we felt like we were buying ourselves time 
we were eating things out a bit longer 
even if everybody change it wouldn't solve the problem 
wouldn't fix the system 
it was vital in the transition but what fascinated me was in the transition to one 
what could actually work 
it struck me that the system itself the framework within which we live is fundamentally flawed and i realized ultimately that are operating system the way our economy functions were economy's been built a system in itself 
see i have to understand complex systems 
take multiple inputs i had to process them to understand the system to win 
to make sense of it 
they look to the global economy i realized it too is that system but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term 
when i realized we'd been perfecting what's effectively and a linear economy for one hundred and fifty years where we take a material out of the ground we make something out of it and then ultimately that product gets thrown away and yet we do recycled some of it but more and attempt to get out what we can at the end not by design 
an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term and if we know that we have finite materials why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up that would create waste 
life itself has existed for billions of years and is continually adapted to use materials effectively 
a complex system that within it there is no waste everything is metabolized it's not a linear economy at all but circular 
and i felt like the child in a garden 
for the first time on this new journey i could see exactly where we were headed 
we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up we could build a future that really could work in the long term i was excited this was something to work towards 
we knew exactly where we were headed 
we just had to work out how to get there and it was exactly this in mind that we create the ellen macarthur foundation in september two thousand and ten 
in many schools of thought fed are thinking and pointed to this model industrial symbiosis performance economy sharing economy biomimicry and of course cradle to cradle design 
material who'd be defined as either technical or biological waste would be designed out entirely and we'd have a system that could function absolutely in the long term 
so what could this economy looked like 
maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings but we'd pay for service of light and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products 
what if packaging was so non toxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink 
it would never become waste 
what if engines will re manufacturable and we could recover the components materials and significantly reduce energy demands 
what if we could recover components from circuit boards we utilize them and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage 
what if we could collect food waste human waste what if we could turn that into fertilizer heat energy ultimately reconnecting nutrient systems and rebuilding natural capital 
because we wanted to move around we don't need to own the materials within 
could cause become a service providers with mobility in the future 
all of this sounds amazing but you don't just ideas that real today and these lie at the forefront of the secular economy 
what lies before us to expand them and scale them up 
so how would you shift from linear circular 
came in at the foundation for what you might want to work with the top universities in the world with leading businesses within the world with the biggest convening platforms in the world and with governments 
we thought you might want to work with the best unless and asking the question can the second economy decouple growth from resource constraints is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital 
could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use yes was the answer to the decoupling but also yes we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering two point seven times 
what inspired me most about the circular economy was his ability to inspire young people 
when young people see the economies to a secular lens they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon 
so they can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system and it's there for the taking right now and the faster we do this the better 
so could we achieve this in their lifetime 
actually possible i believe yes when you look at the lifetime of my great grandfather anything's possible 
when he was born there were only twenty five cars in the world that only just been invented 
when he was fourteen we flew for the first time in history 
a one hundred thousand charter flights every single 
when he was forty five we built 
when he said it wouldn't catch on but it did in just twenty years later we turned it into a microchip of which there will be thousands of in this room here today 
years before he died we built the first mobile phone 
it wasn't that mobile to be fair but now it really is and as my great grandfather left to surf the internet arrived 
and now we can do anything but more importantly now we have a plan 
thank you 
applause 
what started as a platform for hobbyists this poised to become a multi billion dollar industry 
inspection environmental monitoring photography and film and journalism these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones and their enablers or the capabilities being developed and research facilities around the world 
for example before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness and autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six meter tall tower composed of fifty five hundred bricks in front of a live audience and the frac center in france and several years ago he started to fly 
ropes by tethering flying machine they can achieve high speed acceleration in very tight 
we can also autonomously build pencil structures 
skills learned include how to carry loads how to cope with disturbances and in general how to interact with the physical world 
today we want to show you some new project that we've been working on 
their aim is to push the boundaries of what can be achieved with autonomous flight 
for a system to function autonomously it must collectively know the location of its mobile object in space 
back at our lab at zurich we often use external cameras to locate objects which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks 
for the demos you will see today however we will use new localization technology developed by various studios a spin off from our lab 
there are no external cameras 
each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space in onboard computation to determine what it factions should be 
external commands or high level one such as take off and land 
this is a so called tail theater 
an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it 
unlike other fixed wing aircraft it is efficient and forward flight much more so than helicopters and variations 
unlike most other fixed wing aircraft however it is capable of hovering which has huge advantages for takeoff or landing and general versatility 
there is no free lunch unfortunately 
one of the limitations retail sitters are susceptible to disturbances such as wind gust 
we're developing a new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation 
the ideas for the aircraft to recover no matter what state it finds itself in practice improve its performance over time 


when doing research we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of the matter 
for example one such question would be what does the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight 
there are practical reasons why you may want to know the answer to such a question 
helicopters for example are affectionately known as machine one thousand moving parts are conspiring to do you bodily harm 
it turns out that decade ago skilled pilot were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts a propeller and a tail rudder 
we recently discovered that it can be done with just one 
is the model spinner in the world mechanically simplest controlled the flying machine invented just a few months ago 
it has only one moving part a propeller 
it has no flaps no hinges no ailerons no other actuators no other control surfaces just a simple propeller 
even though it's mechanically simple there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space 
even so it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail sitter which means that in order to get to fly i have to throw it just right 
and because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low given everybody watching me where we're going to do instead to show you a video that we shall last night 
applause 

if the model spinner is an exercise in frugality this machine here the army copter with a propellers is an exercise in excess 
what can you do with all the surplus 
one thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric 
as a result it is ambivalent orientation 
gives it an extraordinary capability 
it can move anywhere he wants in space irrespective of how it where it is facing and even of howard is rotating 
has its own complexities mainly having to do with the interacting flows from a tape propellers 
some of this can be modeled while the rest can be burned on the fly let's take a look 

flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives they will need to become extremely safe and reliable 
machine over here is actually two separate to propeller flying machines 
one wants to spend clockwise 
sutherland wants to spin counterclockwise 
when you put them together they behave like one high performance quadrocopters 
if anything goes wrong however a motor fail a propeller fail electronics even a battery pack the machine can supply albeit on the green fashion 
we're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of attack 

this last administration is an exploration of synthetic swarms 
the large number of autonomous coordinated entities offers a new polet for aesthetic expression 
with taken commercially available micro quadcopters each weighing less than a slice of bread by the way and outfitted them with our localization technology and custom algorithms 
because each unit knows where it is in space and self controlled there is really no limit to 
motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines 
ultra safe on over there for example has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on broadway 

the reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nasa technology 
for folks like us the real reward is the journey in the act of creation 
the continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is that it allows created a clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways 
but the fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake 
thank you 

the big question at the center of life in our democracy today how do we fight terror without destroying democracies without trampling human rights 
spent much of my career working with journalists with bloggers with activists with human rights researchers all around the world and i've come to the conclusion that is our democratic societies do not gobbled down on protecting and defending human rights freedom of the press and a free and open internet radical extremist ideologies are much more likely to persist 

thank you very much gesture 
applause 
they want to drill down on a little bit 
so one of the countries that has been on the front lines of this issue is tunisian which was the only country to come out of the arab spring with a successful democratic revolution 
five years later they're struggling with serious terror attacks and rampant isis recruitment 
many tunisians are calling on their government to do whatever it takes to keep them safe 
cartoonist naughty and caring has summed up the situation with this character he says i don't give a damn about human rights i don't give a damn about the revolution 
satisfy his jailer you're safe now 
the tunisian people can figure out how to deal with their terrorism problem without ending up in this place it will be a model not only for their region but for all of us 
reality is that civil society journalists and activists are coming under attack from extremist groups on the one hand and in many countries also from their own governments 
we're seeing bloggers and journalists been jailed charge and intimidated by their own governments many of which are allies with the west in the war on terror 
in just three examples a friend and former colleague of mine his on a moron has been charged with threatening state security along with six other activists in morocco 
saudi blogger re badawi has been jailed and longed for insulting islam and criticizing the saudi regime on his blog 
more recently the turkish representative for reporters without borders arrow on the olu has been detained and charged with spreading terrorist propaganda because he and some other activists have been supporting kurdish 
media anti terror measures quickly turn into state repression without strong protection for minority communities and for peaceful debate this needs to be supported by a robust independent local 
while that's not really happening washington is teaming up with silicon valley and with hollywood to poor millions hundreds of millions of dollars into what's called counter and managing a fancy word for propaganda 
to counter the terrorist propaganda spreading all over the internet in europe internet referral units are being set up so that people can report on extremists content that they find and get it sensor 
the problem is that all of this propaganda monitoring censorship completely fails to make up for the fact that the people who are the most credible voices who can present credible ideas an alternative solutions to real economic social and political problems in their community that are causing people to term to to turn to extremism in the first place are being silenced by their own governments 
is all adding up to a decrease in freedom across the world 
freedom house the human rights organization reports that two thousand and fifteen march that can straight year in a row of decline in freedom worldwide 
this is not just because the actions of authoritarian governments 
also because democratic governments are increasingly cracking down on dissenters whistleblowers an investigative journalists 
secretary general banking moon has warned that preventing extremism and promoting human rights go hand in hand it's not to say that governments shouldn't keep the strength of course they should but we need public oversight transparency and accountability to the rule of law 
meanwhile extremists are literally killing off civil society in some countries 
since two thousand and thirteen in bangladesh over a dozen secular bloggers and community activists have been literally slaughtered by extremists while the government has done very little 
from the city of rocker in syria people like rookie hassan naji jurors have been assassinated for their reporting out of isis controlled territory 
citizen meeting a group called rocca is being slaughtered silently relies on strong encryption to send out their reports and shield themselves from interception and surveillance 
yet authorities in countries like the united states the united kingdom and many other democracies are seeking to use the law to either weaken or outright ban strong encryption because the bad guys are using it to 
we have got to fight for the right of citizens to use strong encryption 
otherwise descent an investigative journalism is going to become even more difficult and even more places 
the bad guys the criminals and terrorists are still going to find ways to communicate 
kudos to the companies that are standing up for their users right to use encryption 
when it comes to censorship the picture is much more troubling 
yes there's a real problem of extremists content stretch spreading all over the internet 
facebook youtube and twitter are among the many companies who report having taken down hundreds of thousands of pieces of content and d activating accounts connected to the extremists speech 
the problem is they're enforcement mechanisms are complete black box and there is collateral damage 
take for example i had about daddy and activists who makes fun of isis on twitter 
how does that count deactivated because he shares a surname with a prominent isis leader 
last december a number of women named isis which also happens to be the name of an egyptian goddess had their accounts deactivated 
and this woman who lives in the united states and as a computer programmer reported on twitter about her activation on facebook managed to get enough media attention to have her account reinstated 
but that's the thing she had to get media attention 
journalists aren't immune 
david thompson an expert on terrorism and reporter for radio france international had reports deleted from his facebook account and had his account deactivated for several days because they contained pictures of isis flat even though he was just reporting on isis not promoting 
and then we have stories from people like this egyptian man ahmed abdulahi who reported recently in a event in washington d c there's some of his arguments with the extremists who now spends his time on social media arguing with ice his followers trying to get turn them away and some of his arguments with these extremists get deleted which he believes has the effect of shielding them from alternative points of view 
it's unclear whether facebook even knows the extent of the collateral damage or the other companies as well 
but we do know that journalism activism and public debate are being silenced and the effort to stamp out as extremists speech 
so with these companies having so much power over the public discourse they need to be held accountable 
they need to hold carry out impact assessment to identify and fix the problems that were clearly seeing 
they need to be more transparent about their enforcement mechanisms and they need to have clear appeal and grievance mechanism so people can get their content reinstated 
and now i've been talking for the last ten minutes about how governments and companies are making it more difficult for people like these 
this is a picture of members of the citizen media network global voices that i hoped to co founded over ten years ago with my friend ethan zuckerman 
interestingly about five years ago right after the arab spring the data scientists gilad low time created a network map of the people in global voices who were heavy users of twitter during the arab spring 
he found that many of these people served his key information nodes between activists journalists throughout the tunisian and egyptian revolution 
we've got to make sure that these people not only survive but are able to continue to thrive 
many of them are still active other than the ones that have gone to jail or have been driven into hiding or exile 
all around the world people who are sick and tired of fear and oppression are linking up in their communities and across borders 
we've got to do everything we can to push our governments and companies to do a better job of protecting their rights 
we've also got to be more mindful about how our own personal political consumer and business choices affect people like these around the world 
also if you follow the news it's pretty clear that that alone isn't going to be enough 
we've got to take personal responsibility by joining or at very least actively supporting the growing ecosystem of individuals and groups who are fighting for social justice environmental sustainability government accountability human rights freedom of the press and a free and open internet all around the world 
i believe that ultimately we can overcome the digitally empowered networks of extremism demagoguery and hate 
but we've got to do this i really beefing up the global networks of citizens around the world powered by people who are working hard every day and taking personal risk for a future world that is more peaceful just open and free 
thanks very much for 
one summer afternoon in two thousand and thirteen dc police detained question and searched a man who appeared suspicious and potentially dangerous 
wasn't what i was wearing the day of the detention to be fair but i have a picture of that as well 
and it's very frightening try to remain calm 

but this time hours in turning the public defender service in washington d c and i was visiting a police station for work 
i was on my way out and before i could make it to my car to police cars pulled up to block my exit and an officer approached me from behind 
he told me to stop take my backpack off and put my hand on the police car parked next to us 
about a dozen officers than gathered near us 
patted me down they took pictures of me spread on the police car and they laughed 
this was happening and that was on the police car trying to ignore the shaking in my legs trying to think clearly about what i should do something stuck out to me as odd 
look at myself in this photo if our to describe myself i think i'd say something like nineteen year old indian male bright t shirt wearing glasses but they weren't including any of these details 
into their police radios as they describe me they kept saying middle eastern male with a backpack 
for middle eastern male with a backpack and this description carried on into their police reports 
i never expected to be described on my own government in these terms lurking nefarious terrorist and the detention dragged on like this 
they sent dogs trained to smile explosives to sweep the area i'd been 
they call the federal government to see if i was on and you watch list 
they spent a couple of detectives to cross examined me on why if i claimed i had nothing to hide i wouldn't consent to a search and my car 
and i could see they weren't happy with me but i felt i had no way of knowing what they'd want to do next 
one point the officer who patted me down scan the side of the police station can see where the security camera was to see how much of this was being recorded 
and when he did that it really think and how completely hours at their mercy 
and i think we're all normalized from a young age to the idea of police officers and arrest in handcuffs so it's easy to forget how demeaning and coercive the thing it is to seize control over another person's body 
i know it sounds like the point of my story is how badly treated i was because in my race and yes i don't think i would have been detained if i were white 
but actually what i had in mind today something else 
what i have in mind is how much worse things might have been if i weren't affluent 
i mean they thought i might be trying to plant and explosive and they investigated that possibility for an hour and a half but i was never put in handcuffs i've never taken to a jail cell 
but i think of our from one of washington d c poor communities of color and they thought i was endangering officers lives things might have ended differently 
and in fact in our system i think it's better to be an affluent person suspected of trying to blow up a police station than it is to be a poor person who suspected of much much less than this 
give you an example from my current work 
right now i'm working at a civil rights organization in d c called equal justice under law 
let me start by asking your question 
how many of you have ever gotten parking ticket in your life raise your hand survey and when i had to pay it felt annoying and felt bad but i paid it and i moved on 
and i'm guessing most of you have paid your tickets as well 
but what would happen if you couldn't afford the amount on the ticket and your family doesn't have the money either what happens then 
well one thing that's not supposed to happen under the law is you're not supposed to be arrested and jailed complete because you can't afford to pay 
illegal under federal law 
but that's what local governments across the country are doing to people who are poor 
so many of our lawsuit that equal justice under law target these modern day debtors prisons 
one of our cases is against ferguson missouri 
i know when i say ferguson many of you will think of police violence 
but today i want to talk about a different aspect of the relationship between their police force and their citizens 
ferguson was issuing an average of over to arrest warrants per person per year mostly for unpaid that to the court 
when i imagine what that would feel like if every time i left my house there was a chance of police officer would run my license plate she a warrant for unpaid get sees my body and the way they did in dc and then take me to a jail so i feel a little sick 
many of the people and ferguson who have experienced this and i've heard some of their stories 
and ferguson's jail in each small cell there's a bunk bed and a toilet but they'd pack for people into each cell 
be two people on the bunks and two people on the floor one with nowhere to go except right next to the filthy toilet which was never cleaned 
and in fact the whole cell was never cleaned so the floor and the walls are lined with blood and mucus 
water to drink except coming out of a spigot connected to the toilet 
underwater looked and tasted dirty there is never enough food never any showers women men straining without any hygiene products no medical attention whatsoever 
when i asked a woman about medical attention she laughed and she said oh no no 
beyond the attention you get from the guards in their sexual 
so they take the data to this place and they'd say we're not letting you leave until you make a payment on your debt and if you could if you could call a family member who could somehow come up with some money then maybe you are out 
it was enough money you're out 
but if it wasn't then you'd stay there for days or weeks and every day the guards would come down to the cells and haggle with the debtors about the price of relief that day 
and each day until at some point the gel rebook to capacity and they'd want to book someone new 
and at that point they'd think ok at unlike in this person can come up with the money it's more likely this new person well you're out there in the machine kept moving like that 
i met a man who nine years ago was arrested for panhandling and a walgreens 
he couldn't afford his fines and his court fees from that case 
when he was young he survived a house fire only because he jumped out the third story window to escape 
but that fall left him with damage to his brain and several parts of his body including his leg 
so you can't work and relies on social security payments to survive 
when i met him in his apartment he had nothing of value they're not even food in his fridge 
is chronically hungry 
we had nothing of value in his apartment except a small piece of cardboard on which he'd written the names of his children he cherishes a lot he was happy to show it to 
but he can't pay to find and fees because he has nothing to give 
in the last nine years he has been arrested thirteen times and jailed for a total of one hundred and thirty days on that panhandling case 
one of those stretches lasted forty five days 
so just imagine spending from right now until sometime in june in the place that i described to you a few moments ago 
he told me about all the suicide attempts he's seen in ferguson's jail about the time a man found a way to hang himself out of reach of the other inmates so all they could do was yell and yell and yell trying to get the guards attention they said they could come down and cut them down 
he told me that it took the guards over five minutes to respond and when they came the man was unconscious 
they called the paramedics and the paramedics meant to the cell 
and they said he'll be ok statist left him there on the floor 
i heard many stories like this nation have surprised me because suicide is the single leading cause of death in our local jails 
is related to the lack of mental health care in our jails 
i met a woman single mother of three making seven dollars an hour 
relies on food stamps to feed yourself and your children 
about a decade ago she got a couple of traffic tickets and a minor theft charge and she can't afford refined and fees on those cases 
since then she has been jailed about ten times on those cases but she has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and she needs medication every day 
if she doesn't have access those medications and ferguson's job and no one has access to their medications 
he told me about what it was like to spend two weeks in a cage hallucinating people and shadows and hearing voices begging for the medication that would make it all stop only to be ignored 
this isn't anomalous either thirty percent of women in our local jails have serious mental health needs just like hers but only one in six receive any mental health care while in jail 
and so i heard all these stories about this grotesque dungeon the forgotten was operating for its debtors and when it came time for me to actually see it and to go and visit ferguson's jail i'm not sure what i was expecting to see but i wasn't expecting death 
ordinary government buildings 
could be a post office or a school 
and it reminded me that these illegal extortion schemes aren't being run somewhere in the shadows they're being run out in the open by our public officials 
matter of public policy 
this reminded me that poverty jailing in general even outside the debtors prison context placing very visible in central role in our justice system 
what i have in mind is our policy of veil 
our system whether you're detained are free pending trial is not a matter of how dangerous you are or how much of a flight rescue pose 
as a matter of whether you can afford to post your bail them out 
so bill cosby whose bill was set in a million dollars immediately write the check and then the second in a jail cell sandra bland who died in jail but only there because her family was unable to come up with five hundred dollars 
in fact there are half a million sandra bland across the country five hundred thousand people who are in jail right now only because they can't afford their veils 
and we're told that our jails are places for criminals but statistically that's not the case three out of every five people in jail right now are there 
pre trial they haven't been convicted of any crime they haven't pled guilty 
right here in san francisco eighty five percent of the inmates in our jail in san francisco are pre trial detainees 
this means san francisco is spending something like eighty million dollars every year to fund pre trial detention 
many of these people who are in jail only because they can't post bale are facing allegations so minor that the amount of time it would take for them to sit waiting for trial is longer than descent instead receivers convicted which means they are guaranteed to get out faster if they just plead guilty 
for now the choices should stay here in this horrible place away from my family my dependent almost guaranteed to lose my job and then fight the charges 
portraitist plead guilty to wherever the prosecutor wants and get out 
at this point their pre trial detainees not criminals 
once they take that deal will call them criminals even though an affluent person would never have been in this situation because an affluent person would have simply been bailed out 
a display you might be wondering disguising the inspiration section 
applause 
it 's extremely depressed and i want my money impact 

but in actuality i find talking about gelling much less depressing than the alternative because i think if we don't talk about these issues and collectively change how we think about jailing at the end of all of our lives will still have jails full of poor people who don't belong there 
that really is depressing to me 
both exciting to me is the thought that these stories can move us to think about jailing and different terms 
sterile policy terms like mass incarceration or sentencing of non violent offenders but in human terms 
when we put a human being in a cage free days or weeks or months or even years what are we doing to that person's mind and body 
under what conditions are really willing to do that 
starting with a few hundred of us in this room we can commit to thinking about jailing and this different light and we can undo that normalization i was referring to earlier 
if i leave you with anything today i hope it's with the thought that if we want anything to fundamentally change not just to reform our policies on fail and finds and fees but also to make sure that whatever new policies replace those don't punish the poor and the marginalized in their own new way 
if we want that kind of change in this shift in thinking is required of each of us 
thank you 

lower pay you what your work 
and no one will ever pay you for your worth 
will only ever pay you what they think your work 
you control their thinking now like this although that would be cool 

it would be really cool and fed like this clearly defining in communicating your value are essential to being paid well for your excellent 
here i want to be paid well ok good and as stark as for everyone 
universal applicability 
sure if you're a business owner if you're an employee here a job seeker 
true if you're a man or woman 
i approached the eighth in atlanta the woman business owner because in my work on observe that women underpriced more so than men 
for gender wage gap as a well traveled narrative in this country 
according to the bureau of labor statistics woman employee earns just eighty three cents for every dollar manner 
what may surprise you that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial spirit 
women business owners earns just eighty cents for every dollar manner 
and my work i've often heard women express that they are uncomfortable communicating their value especially early on and business ownership 
saying things like i don't like to shoot my own horn i'd rather let them work speak for itself i don't like to think my own phrases 
here very different narratives and working with male business owners and i think this difference is costing women twenty cents on the dollar 
so i'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve the profitability 
companies my company 
after my first year in business i saw the prophet increases that my client we're realizing and working with me and i realized that i needed to reevaluate my price 
i was really underpriced relative value i was delivering 
but it's hard for me to admit to you because i'm a frightening consultant 

what i do 
help companies price for value 
but nonetheless with what i thought and so i sat down to evaluate my pricing evaluate my value and i did that by asking key value question 
what are my client needs and how do i meet them 
where does my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my client 
what do i do that no one else does 
what problems do i fell for clients what value do i add i answered these questions and define the value that my clients get from working with me calculated their return on investment and what i saw that he didn't for double my price double it now i confess to you that this terrified 
to me the expert in this but i'm not here 
i knew the value is there 
i was convinced the value is there and i was still scared out of my way 
but if nobody would pay me that 
klein said that's ridiculous ridiculous 
was i were far from the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon 
from a single mom 
what if my business fail 
what if i fail 
but i know how to kick my own medicine the medicine that are prescribed to my client 
i had done the homework 
i knew the value was there 
so when prospects game are prepared the proposals with the new hire pricing and sent them out and communicated the value 
historian 
clients continued to hire me and refer me and recommend me and i'm still here 
and i share the story because doubts and fears are natural and normal 
but they don't define our value and shouldn't limit are earning potential 
and i'd like to share another story about a woman who learn to communicate her value and found her own voice 
we run the thickness for web development company employs several people 
when she first started her from her first several years thereafter she would say i have a little web design company she'd actually used those words with clients i have a little web design company and nathan and many other small ways she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients diminishing herself 
it was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth 
i believe her language and her style communicated that she didn't believe she had much value to offer 
in her own words she was practically giving her services away 
she began her journey to take responsibility for communicating value to clients and changing our message 
one thing i shared with her is that is so important to find your own voice avoidance authentic and true to you 
try to channel your sister in law just because she's a great salesperson or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that's not who you are 
this notion that it's tuning your own horn 
make it about the other party 
focus on serving and adding value and it won't feel like bragging 
what do you love about what you do 
what 's exciting about the work that you do 
you connect with that communicating your value will come naturally 
so she embraced her natural style founder voice and changed her methods 
for one thing she stopped calling yourself a little web design company 
if she really found a lot of strength and power and communicating the message 
now charging three times as much for web design and our business is growing 
if she told me about a recent meeting with a gruff and sometimes difficult client called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization 
in the old days that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her remind film was different 
she said she prepared the information sat down with the client this isn't about me it's not personal rather decline 
if she took them to the data through the numbers laid out the trend and the progress in our own voice and in her own way but very directly fed here's what we've done for you the client sat up and took notice and said ok and she said describing that meeting i didn't feel scared or panicky or small which is how i used to feel 
instead i feel like ok i got this i know what i'm doing 
confident 
being properly value is so important 
and you can hear in the story and the implications range far beyond just finances into the realm of self respect and self confidence 
but they have filled two stories one about defining our value and the other about communicating our values and neither the two elements to realizing our full earning potential 
the equation 
and if you're sitting in the audience today and you're not being paid what you're worth i'd like to welcome you into this equation just imagine what life could be like how much more we can do how much more we could get back how much more we could plan for the future of validated and respected we would feel if we could earn our full potential realize our full value 
no ever pay you what you're worth 
and only ever pay what they think your work and you control their thinking 
thank you 

a few months ago my kids and i huddled around a cell phone watching a live stream of the game award one of the video game industry's biggest night 
they allowed to the nominees for the game for impact and award given to a thought provoking video game with a profound pro social method or meaning 
they opened the envelope and they read the title of our video game 
an award for impact 
with almost funny actually because i always thought that winning an award like that would have the huge impact on my life but i found that the opposite is true 
big night the accomplishments they fade 
but the hardest night of my life have stuck with me impacting who i am and what i do 
in two thousand and ten my third flan joel was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor 
and before that year with finished doctors that my husband and i down and let us know that his tumor had returned despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they can offer him 
that terrible night after learning that joel had perhaps four months to live i cuddled up with my two older fans in bed they were five and three at the time and i never really knew how much they understood so i started telling them a bedtime story 
i told them about this very brave night named joel and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer 
every night i called them more of the story but i never let the story and 
i was just building up a context that they can understand and hoping that our prayers would be answered and i would never have to tell them that night who had fought so bravely was done fighting and could rest now forever 
fortunately i never did have to finish that bedtime story 
and my children outgrew it 
joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment and so instead of month we spent years learning how to love are dying child with all of our hearts 
learning to recognize that shameful feeling of holding back just a little love to try to spare ourselves just a little pain somewhere further down the road 
we pushed past that self preservation because joel with worth levine even if that love can crush 
that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me more than any award ever could 
we started living like joel could live and we began developing a video game called with that dragon cancer it with the story out joel 
it was the story of hope in the shadow of death 
the story of faith and doubt and the realization that a raffle with doubt is a part of faith maybe the biggest part of it 
it was a story that began as a miracle and ended at the memorial 

the 

when you play that dragging cancer your transformed into a witness of joel life exploring an emotional landscape clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt an experienced 
feel the little bit like analyzing interactive poetry because every game mechanic as a metaphor and the more the player asked themselves what we as designers were trying to express and why the richer the experience become 
we took that vulnerability that joel paris and we encoded the game with it 
players expect their video games to offer them branchy narrative so that every decision that they make field important and can change the outcome of the game 
we subverted that principle of game design collapsing the choices in on the player so that they discover for themselves but there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for joel 
they feel that discovery and deeply and desperately as we felt it a night when we held joel in our arms praying for our stubbornly holding out hope for a great that we cannot create for ourselves 
with all prefer to win but when you discover that you can't swing what do you value instead 
i never plan right and video games but the moment that really changed our lives they often come as a result of our hardship and not our glory 
when we thought that george could live i left the game designing for my husband 
chime game here and there with their thien or q and some suggestions 
but after the night that joel died the passion the possibility of sharing jove life through our video game it was something that i couldn't resist 
i started writing more i sat in on our team design meetings i added more ideas and i helped direct theme 
i discovered that creating and video game is telling a story but with an entirely new vocabulary 
all the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there but they're just partnered with player agency and system responsiveness 
challenging work 
i have to think in a totally new way to do it but i love it 
i wouldn't have known that without joel 
maybe you're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game 
perhaps even thinking like so many people before you cancer is not a game 
how that any pediatric cancer parent that's ever taken and bam glove and blown it up into a balloon or transformed a syringe into a rocket ship or let their child ride their ivy pull through the hospital halls like it with a race car 
because when you have children everything is a game 
when you're young child experience and something traumatic you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game because children naturally explore their world through play 
cancer can feel many things from a family it shouldn't feel play 
if you're listening to me and you're trying to imagine this family that revamped entirely around a dying child and you can imagine enjoy as part of that picture and we were right or story with you because that feeling of our life with hard 
peaceably hard at times but it was also pure hope deep love and joy like i have never experienced 
video game with aren't attempt to share that world with people who haven't experienced it before because we never could imagine that world until it became ours 
we made a video game that hard to play 
it will never be a blockbuster 
people have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally in a story that pain no will break their heart 
but when our hearts break they heal a little differently 
my broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion i desired with people in their pain to hear their stories and try to help held them so that they know that their theme 
a night when that dragon cancer won the game for impact on word we cheered we smiled and we talked about joel and the impact she had on our life on all of those hard and hopeful night that we shared with him when he changed our hearts and how to so much more about life and love and faith and purpose 
fat award will never mean as much to me even single photograph of a much fun but it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted people i'll never meet 
they write me email from time 
big tell me that they miss joel even though they never met him 
describe the tears that they shed from my fan and it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter knowing that it shared with a ten year old watching a youtube play through or a doctor plane on his airplane with a smartphone or a professor introducing joel to her first year philosophy student 
we made a video game that hard to play but that feels just right for me because the hardest moments of our lives change more than any goal we could ever accomplish 
tragedy has shifted my heart more than any dream i could ever come true
